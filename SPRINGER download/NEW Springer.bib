  abstract = {Abstract             Personalized learning has a higher impact on students' progress than traditional approaches. However, current resources required to implement personalization are scarce. This research aims to conceptualize and develop an autonomous robot tutor with personalization policy for preschool children aged between three to five years old. Personalization is performed by automatically adjusting the difficulty level of the lesson delivery and assessment, as well as adjusting the feedback based on the reaction of children. This study explores three child behaviors for the personalization policy: (i) academic knowledge (measured by the correctness of the answer), (ii) executive functioning of attention (measured by the orientation and the gaze direction of child's body), and (iii) working memory or hesitation (measured by the time lag before the answer). Moreover, this study designed lesson content through interviews with teachers and deployed the personalization interaction policy through the NAO robot with five children in a case user study method. We qualitatively analyze the session observations and parent interviews, as well as quantitatively analyze knowledge gain through pre- and posttests and a parent questionnaire. The findings of the study reveal that the personalized interaction with the robot showed a positive potential in increasing the children's learning gains and attracting their engagement. As general guidelines based on this pilot study, we identified additional personalization strategies that could be used for autonomous personalization policies based on each child's behavior, which could have a considerable impact on child learning.},

Promoting healthy lifestyle is one of the priorities of primary health care in Oman. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention in promoting physical activity (PA) and healthy diet and its implications on body mass index and glycemic control in adults with diabetes attending primary care.                                         Methods                                A one year 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial will be utilized to compare the use of phone consultations, a multi component interactive phone application and pedometers with the usual diabetes care on promoting PA and healthy diet. Participants will be screened for inactivity and should be T2D, aged18\textendash 65\,years, and overweight or obese. Eight primary centers will be randomly selected in each arm (                 n                 \,=\,375). The primary outcome is the between arms differences in PA and diet scores, BMI and HbA1c over 12\,months from baseline. Additionally, secondary outcomes will include cardiovascular outcomes (BP, and lipids).                              The trial has received ethical approval from the Omani Research and Ethical Review and Approval Committee. All eligible participants will be invited to their respected health centers to provide informed consent.                                         Discussion               This study will contribute to the integration of healthy lifestyle approach using artificial intelligence to primary diabetes care. Results from this study will be disseminated through workshops, policy briefs, and peer-reviewed publications, local and international conferences.

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence as a medical device is increasingly being applied to healthcare for diagnosis, risk stratification and resource allocation. However, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the risk of algorithmic bias, which may perpetuate existing health inequity. This problem arises in part because of systemic inequalities in dataset curation, unequal opportunity to participate in research and inequalities of access. This study aims to explore existing standards, frameworks and best practices for ensuring adequate data diversity in health datasets. Exploring the body of existing literature and expert views is an important step towards the development of consensus-based guidelines. The study comprises two parts: a systematic review of existing standards, frameworks and best practices for healthcare datasets; and a survey and thematic analysis of stakeholder views of bias, health equity and best practices for artificial intelligence as a medical device. We found that the need for dataset diversity was well described in literature, and experts generally favored the development of a robust set of guidelines, but there were mixed views about how these could be implemented practically. The outputs of this study will be used to inform the development of standards for transparency of data diversity in health datasets (the STANDING Together initiative).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Smart homes are becoming increasingly popular in providing people with the services they desire. Activity recognition is a fundamental task to provide personalised home facilities. Many promising approaches are being used for activity recognition; one of them is data-driven. It has some fascinating features and advantages. However, there are drawbacks such as the lack of ability to providing home automation from the day one due to the limited data available. In this paper, we propose an approach, called READY (useR-guided nEw smart home ADaptation sYstem) for developing a personalised automation system that provides the user with smart home services the moment they move into their new house. The system development process was strongly user-centred, involving users in every step of the system's design. Later, the user-guided transfer learning approach was introduced that uses an old smart home data set to enhance the existing smart home service with user contributions. Finally, the proposed approach and designed system were tested and validated in the smart lab that showed promising results.},

TE is a teaching process for training patients so that they can self-manage their care plan. Alongside traditional methods of providing educational content, there are now alternative forms of delivery thanks to the implementation of advanced Information Technologies systems such as conversational agents (CAs). In this context, we present the AIDA project: an ensemble of two different CAs intended to provide a TE tool for people with diabetes. The Artificial Intelligence Diabetes Assistant (AIDA) consists of a text-based chatbot and a speech-based dialog system. Their content has been created and validated by a scientific board. AIDA Chatbot\textemdash the text-based agent\textemdash provides a broad spectrum of information about diabetes, while AIDA Cookbot\textemdash the voice-based agent\textemdash presents recipes compliant with a diabetic patient's diet. We provide a thorough description of the development process for both agents, the technology employed and their usage by the general public. AIDA Chatbot and AIDA Cookbot are freely available and they represent the first example of conversational agents in Italian to support diabetes patients, clinicians and caregivers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Bias, unfairness and lack of transparency and accountability in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, and the potential for the misuse of predictive models for decision-making have raised concerns about the ethical impact and unintended consequences of new technologies for society across every sector where data-driven innovation is taking place. This paper reviews the landscape of suggested ethical frameworks with a focus on those which go beyond high-level statements of principles and offer practical tools for application of these principles in the production and deployment of systems. This work provides an assessment of these practical frameworks with the lens of known best practices for impact assessment and audit of technology. We review other historical uses of risk assessments and audits and create a typology that allows us to compare current AI ethics tools to Best Practices found in previous methodologies from technology, environment, privacy, finance and engineering. We analyse current AI ethics tools and their support for diverse stakeholders and components of the AI development and deployment lifecycle as well as the types of tools used to facilitate use. From this, we identify gaps in current AI ethics tools in auditing and risk assessment that should be considered going forward.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Here propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to differentiate COVID-19 (the coronavirus disease of 2019) patients from normal cases, as well as to perform infection region segmentation along with infection severity estimation using computed tomography (CT) images. The developed system facilitates timely administration of appropriate treatment by identifying the disease stage without reliance on medical professionals. So far, this developed model gives the most accurate, fully automatic COVID-19 real-time CAD framework.                                         Results               The CT image dataset of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 individuals were subjected to conventional ML stages to perform binary classification. In the feature extraction stage, SIFT, SURF, ORB image descriptors and bag of features technique were implemented for the appropriate differentiation of chest CT regions affected with COVID-19 from normal cases. This is the first work introducing this concept for COVID-19 diagnosis application. The preferred diverse database and selected features that are invariant to scale, rotation, distortion, noise etc. make this framework real-time applicable. Also, this fully automatic approach which is faster compared to existing models helps to incorporate it into CAD systems. The severity score was measured based on the infected regions along the lung field. Infected regions were segmented through a three-class semantic segmentation of the lung CT image. Using severity score, the disease stages were classified as mild if the lesion area covers less than 25\% of the lung area; moderate if 25\textendash 50\% and severe if greater than 50\%. Our proposed model resulted in classification accuracy of 99.7\% with a PNN classifier, along with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9988, 99.6\% sensitivity, 99.9\% specificity and a misclassification rate of 0.0027. The developed infected region segmentation model gave 99.47\% global accuracy, 94.04\% mean accuracy, 0.8968 mean IoU (intersection over union), 0.9899 weighted IoU, and a mean Boundary F1 (BF) contour matching score of 0.9453, using Deepabv3+ with its weights initialized using ResNet-50.                                         Conclusions               The developed CAD system model is able to perform fully automatic and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 along with infected region extraction and disease stage identification. The ORB image descriptor with bag of features technique and PNN classifier achieved the superior classification performance.},

Virtual assistants are a promising alternative for non-pharmacological interventions. This research aims to present a prototype of ADELA, a conversational assistant to prevent delirium in hospitalized older persons who speak Spanish. A co-creation process with medical experts to identify requirements was carried out to later develop the assistant iteratively and evaluate it from a technical and usability perspectives; the latest using the Spanish version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ), supplemented by qualitative data. Mean values of 75.5 and 85.94 were obtained for SUS and CUQ, respectively. The technical evaluation helped defining the minimum environmental specifications required for deployment. Obtained results imply the assistant is usable and potentially accepted by the target population; useful information was extracted for refinement. Technical evaluation showed positive results, indicating it can be used in a real clinical environment.},

We identified 35 papers published between 2018 and 2022 relevant to this review and used these to identify specific areas where stakeholder involvement has been carried out.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Automation in computing systems has always been considered a valuable solution to unburden the user. Internet of Things (IoT) technology best suits automation in different domains, such as home automation, retail, industry, and transportation, to name but a few. While these domains are strongly characterized by implicit user interaction, more recently, automation has been adopted also for the provision of interactive and immersive experiences that actively involve the users. IoT technology thus becomes the key for Smart Interactive Experiences (SIEs), i.e., immersive automated experiences created by orchestrating different devices to enable smart environments to fluidly react to the final users' behavior. There are domains, e.g., cultural heritage, where these systems and the SIEs can support and provide several benefits. However, experts of such domains, while intrigued by the opportunity to induce SIEs, are facing tough challenges in their everyday work activities when they are required to automate and orchestrate IoT devices without the necessary coding skills. This paper presents a design approach that tries to overcome these difficulties thanks to the adoption of ontologies for defining Event-Condition-Action rules. More specifically, the approach enables domain experts to identify and specify properties of IoT devices through a               user-defined semantics               that, being closer to the domain experts' background, facilitates them in automating the IoT devices behavior. We also present a study comparing three different interaction paradigms conceived to support the specification of user-defined semantics through a ``transparent'' use of ontologies. Based on the results of this study, we work out some lessons learned on how the proposed paradigms help domain experts express their semantics, which in turn facilitates the creation of interactive applications enabling SIEs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Disaster emergency management is crucial for safeguarding lives and the environment in the face of natural and human-caused calamities, such as quick clay landslides. Disaster emergency management encompasses hazard identification, prevention, response, and recovery, most of which require knowledge and information acquired through training initiatives. Quick clay landslides pose a substantial hazard in regions like Scandinavia, Canada, Alaska, and Russia. With numerous historical incidents, knowledge-based awareness of quick clay landslide hazards is of paramount importance. In recent years, the area of application of virtual reality (VR) has grown tremendously from the entertainment industry to the military, to mental health, to hazard identification training and our daily lives. VR has been widely employed in hazard identification and prevention, safety training, evacuation, search and rescue, and damage identification of hazards. This study outlines the design, development, and implementation of QuickAware, a VR tool designed to create awareness of quick clay hazards. The development process of the tool started with a co-design approach where stakeholder experts were brought to collaborate in setting up VR scenarios and defining the VR environment contents. The contents were then conceptualized and translated into a VR experience. The novelty of the tool is that it immerses users in a realistic experience, allowing them to engage directly with the causes and consequences of quick clay landslide disasters which would be dangerous in real-life. The usability of the VR tool was examined by surveying 16 participants. The preliminary results of the survey indicated that the tool has a promising value in improving awareness creation for quick clay landslide hazards.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent innovations in the smart city domain have led to the proposition of a new mode of transportation utilizing Autonomous Passenger Ships (APS) or ferries in inland waterways. The novelty of the APS concept influenced the cyber risk paradigm and led to different considerations regarding attack objectives, techniques as well as risk management approaches. The main factor that has led to this is the autoremote operational mode, which refers to autonomous operations and remote supervision and control in case of emergency. The autoremote operational mode influences the risk of cyber attacks due to the increased connectivity and reliance on technology for automating navigational functions. On the other hand, the presence of passengers without crew members imposes a safety risk factor in cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new cyber risk management approach for managing the cyber risks against cyber physical systems in general and Autonomous Passenger Ships in particular. Our proposed approach aims to improve the Defense-in-Depth risk management strategy with additional components from the Threat-Informed Defense strategy allowing for more evolved cyber risk management capabilities. Moreover, we have utilized the proposed cyber risk management approach for the proposition of a cybersecurity architecture for managing the cyber risks against an APS use case named milliAmpere2. Additionally, we present our results after conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in cybersecurity evaluation in the maritime domain. Then, the findings of the SLR were utilized for a suitable evaluation of the proposed risk management approach. Our findings suggest that our proposed risk management approach named Threat-Informed Defense-in-Depth is capable of enriching several risk management activities across different stages in the system development life cycle. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity posture of milliAmpere2 has been conducted using several approaches including risk evaluation, simulation, checklist, and adversary emulation. Our evaluation has uncovered several limitations in the current cybersecurity posture and proposed actions for improvement.},

Since the potential of industrial symbiosis (IS) and energy efficiency (EE) about environmental, economic and social issues has been discovered, the interest in them is gradually increasing. The funding and investments for IS and EE are highly encouraged by the European Commission, while more and more policies as well as research and innovation (R\&I) activities are initiated to promote European industry's advancement towards a circular economy and CO               2               neutrality. The aim is to maintain the competitiveness and economic progress of the industry. The key to build a competitive and sustainable European manufacturing industry is to create a competent, highly qualified workforce that is capable of handling the new business models coming with IS and EE requirements and digital technologies. We can generate this by identifying the skills needs and upskilling and reskilling the current workforce accordingly by delivering the suitable training programmes. Therefore, this work identifies the most critical skills needs related to IS and EE for six different energy-intensive sectors (steel, ceramic, water, cement, chemical and minerals) in Europe. The effect of the digital transformation on the skills needs is as well discussed. The identified skills are aimed to be included in vocational education and training (VET), tertiary education and other kinds of training curricula. We also identify the cross-sectoral most representative job profiles linked with EE and IS in these sectors and demonstrate the methodology for the selection process. Furthermore, we present a key tool for identifying the most significant current and future skills requirements. Also, we define the critical skill gaps of the European process industry using this tool. Once the skill gaps are defined, they can be reduced by delivering well-developed continuous trainings. We also link our work to the respectable ESCO, the European Classification of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations, to attain a common ground with other studies and frameworks, minimise the complexity and contribute to their work. Our work is developed to be an academic and industrial guideline to prepare well-developed training programmes to deliver the needed skills.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Data practices in biomedical research often rely on standards that build on normative assumptions regarding privacy and involve `ethics work.' In an increasingly datafied research environment, identifiability gains a new temporal and spatial dimension, especially in regard to genomic data. In this paper, we analyze how genomic identifiability is considered as a specific data issue in a recent controversial case: publication of the genome sequence of the HeLa cell line. Considering developments in the sociotechnological and data environment, such as big data, biomedical, recreational, and research uses of genomics, our analysis highlights what it means to be (re-)identifiable in the postgenomic era. By showing how the risk of genomic identifiability is not a specificity of the HeLa controversy, but rather a systematic data issue, we argue that a new conceptualization is needed. With the notion of               post-identifiability               as a sociotechnological situation, we show how past assumptions and ideas about future possibilities come together in the case of genomic identifiability. We conclude by discussing how kinship, temporality, and openness are subject to renewed negotiations along with the changing understandings and expectations of identifiability and status of genomic data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper develops the notion of ``open data product''. We define an open data product as the open result of the processes through which a variety of data (open and not) are turned into accessible information through a service, infrastructure, analytics or a combination of all of them, where each step of development is designed to promote open principles. Open data products are born out of a (data) need and add value beyond simply publishing existing datasets. We argue that the process of adding value should adhere to the principles of open (geographic) data science, ensuring openness, transparency and reproducibility. We also contend that outreach, in the form of active communication and dissemination through dashboards, software and publication are key to engage end-users and ensure societal impact. Open data products have major benefits. First, they enable insights from highly sensitive, controlled and/or secure data which may not be accessible otherwise. Second, they can expand the use of commercial and administrative data for the public good leveraging on their high temporal frequency and geographic granularity. We also contend that there is a compelling need for open data products as we experience the current data revolution. New, emerging data sources are unprecedented in temporal frequency and geographical resolution, but they are large, unstructured, fragmented and often hard to access due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. By transforming raw (open or ``closed'') data into ready to use open data products, new dimensions of human geographical processes can be captured and analysed, as we illustrate with existing examples. We conclude by arguing that several parallels exist between the role that open source software played in enabling research on spatial analysis in the 90~s and early 2000s, and the opportunities that open data products offer to unlock the potential of new forms of (geo-)data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             With transformative evolution involving crypto-assets, machine learning applications and data-driven finance models, complex regulatory and policy issues are emerging. Inadequate frameworks in FinTech markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation. These limitations continue to feature when piecemeal regulatory transition occurs. The danger of EU Member States being left behind in the FinTech innovation race if the regulatory landscape is cumbersome or incomplete for new business models is real. Regulatory lag and regulatory friction also act as a `disenabler' for ease of cross-border FinTech trade in the EU. This article critically engages with the manner in which the regulatory sandbox has rapidly gained critical mass in Member States as a valuable adaptive measure supporting a route to market for FinTech entrepreneurs. Against the backdrop of the European Commission's Digital Finance Strategy, the article further advances scholarship on FinTech in the EU by probing the EU's resulting regulatory dilemma, undertaking a systematic evaluation of the continuum of complex policy options available to the European Union in response to the spreading regulatory sandbox phenomenon.},

This is particularly challenging in the context of AI systems for healthcare, which requires balancing the potential benefits of the solution against the risks to patients and the wider community, including minorities and underserved populations. To address this challenge, we propose a shift from one-size-fits-all ethical principles to contextualized case-based ethical frameworks. This study uses an AI-enabled mHealth application as a case study. Our framework is built on existing ethical guidelines and principles, including the AI4People framework, the EU High-Level Expert Group on trustworthy AI, and wider human rights considerations. Additionally, we incorporate relational perspectives to address human value concerns and moral tensions between individual rights and public health. Our approach is based on ''ethics by design,'' where ethical principles are integrated throughout the entire AI development pipeline, ensuring that ethical considerations are not an afterthought but implemented from the beginning. For our case study, we identified 7 ethical principles: fairness, agility, precision, safeguarding humanity, respect for others, trust and accountability, and robustness and reproducibility. We believe that the best way to mitigate and address ethical consequences is by implementing ethical principles in the software development processes that developers commonly use. Finally, we provide examples of how our case-based framework can be applied in practice, using examples of AI-driven mobile applications in healthcare.},

Previous research has conceptualized AI transparency as knowledge that empowers citizens and experts to make informed choices about the use and governance of AI. Conversely, in this paper, we critically examine if transparency-as-knowledge is an appropriate concept for a public realm where private interests intersect with democratic concerns. We conduct a practice-based design research study in which we prototype and evaluate a transparent smart electric vehicle charge point, and investigate experts' and citizens' understanding of AI transparency. We find that citizens experience transparency as burdensome; experts hope transparency ensures acceptance, while citizens are mostly indifferent to AI; and with absent means of control, citizens question transparency's relevance. The tensions we identify suggest transparency cannot be reduced to a product feature, but should be seen as a mediator of debate between experts and citizens.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Social robot design projects typically involve multidisciplinary teamwork and collaboration, adopt a Human-Centred Design (HCD) approach, and deal with physical (tangible) objects, i.e., robots. HCD takes a human to the centre point of the design process. A typical activity in HCD are design workshops where a facilitator is needed to guide and moderate the task-related and interactional activities throughout the session. Facilitation is also usually needed in longer-term design projects or courses to guide participants through the different phases of design during several sessions. Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most design activities including social robot design were rapidly transferred to online mode. Designing for tangible objects is challenging in online settings because the interaction experience with a physical object is hard to demonstrate online. In this article, we report how we harnessed online canvases to support both short-term social robot design workshops and a long-term design course. Based on participants' feedback and facilitators' experiences, we report lessons learned from utilizing collaborative design canvases for creative social robot design projects that specifically focus on early stages and concept ideation. We propose practical guidelines for canvas-based online facilitation focusing on creative design workshops and projects. In addition, we discuss the lessons learned concerning social robot design activities taking place in online mode. To respond to the challenges of designing tangible robots in a fully online mode, we suggest a Hybrid Robotic Design Model (HRDM), where the participants work in contact with facilitators, other participants and robots at specific points, while the other phases are conducted online.},

Such harmful automated decision-making can be guarded against by ensuring AI systems are contestable by design: responsive to human intervention throughout the system lifecycle. Contestable AI by design is a small but growing field of research. However, most available knowledge requires a significant amount of translation to be applicable in practice. A proven way of conveying intermediate-level, generative design knowledge is in the form of frameworks. In this article we use qualitative-interpretative methods and visual mapping techniques to extract from the literature sociotechnical features and practices that contribute to contestable AI, and synthesize these into a design framework.},

Efficient technological transfer and the role of public\textendash private sector collaboration play a major role in the modern growth of knowledge-based economies. As a public service organization, municipalities normally coordinate with all partners to draw up strategies and use them in communities. A new vision is needed for the Gaza Strip municipalities, where all public and private stakeholders work together to co-design and co-develop new cutting-edge products and services aimed at generating shared value through entrepreneurial behavior. However, concrete examples of smart city projects revealed that municipalities often do not have the necessary capabilities as well as innovative approaches to collaborate with start-ups and other stakeholders' ecosystems. So, this paper aims to analyze innovation in the municipal sector shedding light on the barriers and challenges that municipalities in the Gaza Strip face in smart city development. This study uses primary data gathered from various stakeholders through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and webinars to conclude how the Gaza Strip municipalities can work to address challenges in the smart city context; and to explore how to promote an ecosystem of entrepreneurship and innovation to support the adoption of new hi-tech technologies in the municipal sector. The Gaza Strip municipalities need to offer the necessary conditions for entrepreneurial talents who can bring their creative mindset, and technological experiences to the table, making it possible to build the best teams to solve any challenge. The research also concluded that Open Innovation Platforms can be seen as an important tool for enabling start-ups and researchers to develop innovative Hi-Tech solutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               To drive translational medicine, modern day biobanks need to integrate with other sources of data (clinical, genomics) to support novel data-intensive research. Currently, vast amounts of research and clinical data remain in silos, held and managed by individual researchers, operating under different standards and governance structures; a framework that impedes sharing and effective use of data. In this article, we describe the journey of British Columbia's Gynecological Cancer Research Program (OVCARE) in moving a traditional tumour biobank, outcomes unit, and a collection of data silos, into an integrated data commons to support data standardization and resource sharing under collaborative governance, as a means of providing the gynecologic cancer research community in British Columbia access to tissue samples and associated clinical and molecular data from thousands of patients.                                         Results               Through several engagements with stakeholders from various research institutions within our research community, we identified priorities and assessed infrastructure needs required to optimize and support data collections, storage and sharing, under three main research domains: (1) biospecimen collections, (2) molecular and genomics data, and (3) clinical data. We further built a governance model and a resource portal to implement protocols and standard operating procedures for seamless collections, management and governance of interoperable data, making genomic, and clinical data available to the broader research community.                                         Conclusions               Proper infrastructures for data collection, sharing and governance is a translational research imperative. We have consolidated our data holdings into a data commons, along with standardized operating procedures to meet research and ethics requirements of the gynecologic cancer community in British Columbia. The developed infrastructure brings together, diverse data, computing frameworks, as well as tools and applications for managing, analyzing, and sharing data. Our data commons bridges data access gaps and barriers to precision medicine and approaches for diagnostics, treatment and prevention of gynecological cancers, by providing access to large datasets required for data-intensive science.},

The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is one such program which aims to improve the state of the world's oceans and promote a sustainable seafood market. Now in its 21st year, with approximately 14\% of global fisheries landings certified, there is growing evidence of the program's impacts (direct and indirect) on factors from fisheries management and consumer awareness to coastal communities' livelihoods and international law. To better understand the program as a whole, the proposed systematic map will collate and describe published research on the environmental, social and economic effects of the MSC program, and indicate the prevalence of disciplines or topics and study designs in this literature. Areas considered of greater interest, knowledge gaps, and future research priorities will be identified.                                         Methods               This systematic map protocol describes how research regarding the MSC will be searched, identified and described. All research on the MSC and its effects (direct and indirect) will be included. The review is not limited to effects on certified fisheries but will include those on supply chain companies, socio-economics of coastal communities, governments, biological populations and ecosystems, NGOs and other stakeholders impacted by or potentially influenced by the MSC. The search scope includes studies from MSC's foundation in 1997 to the present. To identify studies, pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used at the title, abstract and full text levels. In addition to the use of bibliographic databases and internet search engines, the authors will call for and search for grey-literature. The final systematic map will be presented in a descriptive report detailing the focus, extent, and occurrence of research on the MSC's impacts, taking special care to map the disciplines focused on the programme and the study design of research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been widely applied to various contexts, including high-stake decision processes in healthcare, banking, and judicial systems. Some developed AI models fail to offer a fair output for specific minority groups, sparking comprehensive discussions about AI fairness. We argue that the development of AI systems is marked by a central paradox: the less participation one stakeholder has within the AI system's life cycle, the more influence they have over the way the system will function. This means that the impact on the fairness of the system is in the hands of those who are less impacted by it. However, most of the existing works ignore how different aspects of AI fairness are dynamically and adaptively affected by different stages of AI system development. To this end, we present a use case to discuss fairness in the development of corporate wellness programs using smart wearables and AI algorithms to analyze data. The four key stakeholders throughout this type of AI system development process are presented. These stakeholders~are called service designer, algorithm designer, system deployer, and end-user. We identify three core aspects of AI fairness, namely, contextual fairness, model fairness, and device fairness. We propose a relative contribution of the four stakeholders to the three aspects of fairness. Furthermore, we propose the boundaries and interactions between the four roles, from which we make our conclusion about the possible unfairness in such an AI developing process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The purpose of this paper is to carry out content analyses on the existing literature to investigate the knowledge state of innovation facilitators adopted to promote financial innovation. In total, 56 papers were analysed using the NVivo software package. Three categories of innovation facilitators emerged from the literature capturing the perspective of regulators, incumbents and new entrants. Each identified instrument is defined and its processes and implications described. Many initiatives were led by regulators, revealing a regulatory strategy change from risk-based to opportunity-based regulation, with regulatory sandboxes being the most commonly adopted instrument. Incumbent-led innovation facilitators were also identified and typically took the form of corporate incubation models, co-working spaces, venture funds and innovation platforms to support financial institutions with partnerships, acquisitions or self-development. Lastly, the literature review revealed innovator-led instruments to support start-ups with raising capital. Based on our results, we discuss several important observations and propose avenues for future research capturing each of the identified perspectives. This paper contributes to incubation research and the financial innovation and FinTech literature streams.},

  abstract = {Abstract             With the development of digital technologies, big urban data is now readily available online. This opens the opportunity to utilize new data and create new relationships within multiple urban features for cities. Moreover, new computational design techniques open a new portal for architects and designers to reinterpret this urban data and provide much better-informed design decisions. The ``AI Urban Voids'' project is defined as a data-driven approach to analyze and predict the strategic location for urban uses in the addition of amenities within the city. The location of these urban amenities is evaluated based on predictions and scores followed by a series of urban analyses and simulations using K-Means clustering. Furthermore, these results are then visualized in a web-based platform; likewise, the aim is to create a tool that will work on a feedback loop system that constantly updates the information. This paper explains the use of different datasets from Five cities including Melbourne, Sydney, Berlin, Warsaw, and Sao Paulo. Python, Osmx libraries and K-means clustering open the way to manipulate large data sets by introducing a collection of computational processes that can override traditional urban analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students' understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n\,=\,21) and the control (n\,=\,26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students' CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students' CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Rapid reviews (RRs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to time-consuming systematic reviews\textemdash they can help meet the demand for accelerated evidence synthesis to inform decision-making in healthcare. The synthesis of diagnostic evidence has important methodological challenges. Here, we performed an international survey to identify the current practice of producing RRs for diagnostic tests.                                         Methods               We developed and administered an online survey inviting institutions that perform RRs of diagnostic tests from all over the world.                                         Results                                All participants (                 N                 \,=\,25) reported the implementation of one or more methods to define the scope of the RR; however, only one strategy (defining a structured question) was used by {$\geq$}90\% of participants. All participants used at least one methodological shortcut including the use of a previous review as a starting point (92\%) and the use of limits on the search (96\%). Parallelization and automation of review tasks were not extensively used (48 and 20\%, respectively).                                                        Conclusion               Our survey indicates a greater use of shortcuts and limits for conducting diagnostic test RRs versus the results of a recent scoping review analyzing published RRs. Several shortcuts are used without knowing how their implementation affects the results of the evidence synthesis in the setting of diagnostic test reviews. Thus, a structured evaluation of the challenges and implications of the adoption of these RR methods is warranted.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Among the different circular strategies, remanufacturing proves to be particularly interesting since it aims to maintain the value of building components overtime extending their lifespan by guaranteeing multiple consequent cycles of use, overcoming in this way the most common down-cycling logics. However, unlike other industrial fields which already benefit from remanufacturing, the construction sector delays to adopt this practice due to barriers of different nature, namely organizational, information, technical, regulatory and economic. Among these barriers, the first two can now be addressed more effectively thanks to the support of Information and Communication Technologies. The latter offer the possibility of real-time monitoring, remote communication and scenario modeling, opening up to innovative solutions for remanufacturing. Hence, the paper aims to investigate how the application of ICTs can support the cognitive and organizational processes related to remanufacturing of building components. In particular, the paper explores the application of sensing technologies, digital twins and information platforms and assess their potential to support the implementation of circular service-based remanufacturing models in the construction sector.},

Previous proposals for software component selection tend to be technology-specific and/or do not consider business or ecosystem concerns.                                         Objective               Our main aim is to develop an industrially relevant technology-agnostic method that can support practitioners in making informed decisions when selecting software components for use in tools or in products based on a holistic perspective of the overall environment.                                         Method               We used method engineering to iteratively develop a software selection method for Ericsson AB based on a combination of published research and practitioner insights. We used interactive rapid reviews to systematically identify and analyse scientific literature and to support close cooperation and co-design with practitioners from Ericsson. The model has been validated through a focus group and by practical use at the case company.                                         Results               The model consists of a high-level selection process and a wide range of criteria for assessing and for evaluating software to include in business products and tools.                                         Conclusions               We have developed an industrially relevant model for component selection through active engagement from a company. Co-designing the model based on previous knowledge demonstrates a viable approach to industry-academia collaboration and provides a practical solution that can support practitioners in making informed decisions based on a holistic analysis of business, organisation and technical factors.},

Many economic, socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors require ports to move towards digitalization and sustainability. To this end, ports are required to change into smart ports that align with new Industry 4.0 practices to ensure their sustainability. This study proposes a systematic review of the literature on the emerging smart port concept to continue the work started by Buiza et al. and Molavi et al., aiming at a broader and comprehensive understanding of the smart port concept by business domain to fill this gap in literature. This research proposes 11 smart port characteristics grouped into 7 business domains. A definition is also proposed to update the concept.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Over the last two decades, several deployments of robots for in-house assistance of older adults have been trialled. However, these solutions are mostly prototypes and remain unused in real-life scenarios. In this work, we review the historical and current landscape of the field, to try and understand why robots have yet to succeed as personal assistants in daily life. Our analysis focuses on two complementary aspects: the capabilities of the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. The former analysis shows regularities in hardware configurations and functionalities, leading to the definition of a set of six application-level capabilities (               exploration               ,               identification               ,               remote control               ,               communication               ,               manipulation               , and               digital situatedness               ). The latter focuses on the impact of robots on the daily life of users and categorises the deployment of robots for healthcare interventions using three types of services:               support               ,               mitigation               , and               response               . Our investigation reveals that the value of healthcare interventions is limited by a stagnation of functionalities and a disconnection between the robotic platform and the design of the intervention. To address this issue, we propose a novel co-design toolkit, which uses an ecological framework for robot interventions in the healthcare domain. Our approach connects robot capabilities with known geriatric factors, to create a holistic view encompassing both the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. As a case study-based validation, we discuss the use of the toolkit in the pre-design of the robotic platform for an pilot intervention, part of the EU large-scale pilot of the EU H2020 GATEKEEPER project.},

Automated classroom analytics employ advanced data analysis, providing educators with comprehensive insights into student participation, engagement, and behavioral trends within classroom settings. Through the provision of context-sensitive feedback, automated classroom analytics systems can be integrated into the evidence-based pedagogical decision-making and reflective practice processes of faculty members in higher education institutions. This paper presents TEACHActive, an automated classroom analytics system, by detailing its design and implementation. It outlines the processes of stakeholder engagement and mapping, elucidates the benefits and obstacles associated with a comprehensive classroom analytics system design, and concludes by discussing significant implications. These implications propose user-centric design approaches for higher education researchers and practitioners to consider.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Complex water-related challenges hunger, poverty, climate change, biodiversity, land-use change, desertification agriculture, industrialization, urbanization, human population, and hygiene, need wise and urgent actions to overcome them. Globally, many drivers such as the U.S.-Chinese competition, the Russo\textendash Ukrainian war, food security, pandemics, and human overpopulation, have water-related impacts. Freshwater is a truly complex interdisciplinary topic that requires innovative intelligent-inclusive ideas to reconcile limited water resources with expanding water demands. The article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) could rethink human-water interactions, remake water practices, humanize water science, and enhance daily water life. The Global Goals could be viewed as an integrated framework of human effort to face pressing today's issues and to formulate a more sustainable and better world. Goal 6 (SDG 6 ``sustaining water'') devoted to sustaining water and related actions for all humans is the skeleton of global goals (GGs). The Arabsphere faces severe water quality, quantity, and practice challenges to ensure the smooth achievement of global goals (GGs). Compared with the whole world and its main regions, the overall water stress indicator in the Arabsphere is greater than 100\% (critical). This article explores how applied intelligence could be strengthened to achieve Goal 6, focuses on the ``water stress'' indicator, and how to ensure a sustainable water future (SWF) in the Arabsphere. The Intelligent Water Hackathon is a collaborative open science event. The hackathon was designed to mitigate water stress (WS) in the Arabsphere. The hackathon process involves four main phases: problem identification, team building, solution proposing, and presentation. The paper concludes hackathons could be a valuable process for the water researchers' community to generate new and creative ideas and collective knowledge. Hackathon events could mitigate water stress, strengthen community engagement, and improve water resources outcomes. In closing, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies are efficient providers to mitigate water stress, scarcity, and related risks. A future-driven Arab water vision based on artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent water systems (IWSs) should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The future of large rivers is related to regional cooperation programs for the sustainable development of water and related resources in great river basins. The objective of this article is to present how roadmaps can be utilized for both building up sustainable development for the Nile River, and supporting the integration of national and regional development strategies in Egypt and other Nile basin countries. The strategic objective is to highlight a wide range of sustainable freshwater pathways for an inclusive, peaceful, and sustainable future for all. In particular, it focuses on generating innovative water solutions, actions, and practices that enhance water exploitation in large river basins, transboundary shared rivers, and other transboundary shared water resources. The roadmapping approach is adopted and developed widely in the science, technology, and innovation community. The paper concentrates on roadmapping as an important tool that promotes sound planning of sustainability of large rivers, and in particular, transboundary shared rivers. The roadmap analyzes the benefits of planning shared water cooperation that extends to ecological, economic, and political features, and also beyond the river for the benefit of all, and identifies at an early stage the actions needed to manage the associated technology and environmental risk. The roadmap includes the key water resources governance characteristics, geographical scope, climate change (CC), and its impact, member states, organizational structure, decision-making, data information sharing, monitoring, the role of multiple stakeholders, financing, legal basis, dispute resolution, and benefit sharing. Therefore, a roadmap for the Nile River can help raise productivity and support faster growth, if considered as a lighthouse for national development strategies. Roadmap for the Nile River proposes windows of opportunity and is a vital milestone for cooperation, peace, stability, joint investment, and prosperity. With possible benefits exceeding those derived from the river itself, a roadmap for the Nile River can catalyze strengthened cooperation and greater regional ecological, economic, social, and political integration. The paper concludes that the roadmap for the Nile River sustainability (NRS) is a promising model for assuring the sustainability of transboundary shared large rivers.},

The development of research platforms has highlighted the value of research-ready data, particularly for multi-cohort analyses. Following stakeholder consultation, a standard data model (C-Surv) optimised for data discovery, was developed using data from 5 population and clinical cohort studies. The model uses a four-tier nested structure based on 18 data themes selected according to user behaviour or technology. Standard variable naming conventions are applied to uniquely identify variables within the context of longitudinal studies. The data model was used to develop a harmonised dataset for 11 cohorts. This dataset populated the Cohort Explorer data discovery tool for assessing the feasibility of an analysis prior to making a data access request. Data preparation times were compared between cohort specific data models and C-Surv.             It was concluded that adopting a common data model as a data standard for the discovery and analysis of research cohort data offers multiple benefits.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Clinicians often report that their own anxiety and low self-efficacy inhibit their use of evidence-based suicide prevention practices, including gold-standard screening and brief interventions. Exposure therapy to reduce clinician maladaptive anxiety and bolster self-efficacy use is a compelling but untested approach to improving the implementation of suicide prevention evidence-based practices (EBPs). This project brings together an interdisciplinary team to leverage decades of research on behavior change from exposure theory to design and pilot test an exposure-based implementation strategy (EBIS) to target clinician anxiety to improve suicide prevention EBP implementation.                                         Methods               We will develop, iteratively refine, and pilot test an EBIS paired with implementation as usual (IAU; didactic training and consultation) in preparation for a larger study of the effect of this strategy on reducing clinician anxiety, improving self-efficacy, and increasing use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Safety Planning Intervention in outpatient mental health settings. Aim 1 of this study is to use participatory design methods to develop and refine the EBIS in collaboration with a stakeholder advisory board. Aim 2 is to iteratively refine the EBIS with up to 15 clinicians in a pilot field test using rapid cycle prototyping. Aim 3 is to test the refined EBIS in a pilot implementation trial. Forty community mental health clinicians will be randomized 1:1 to receive either IAU or IAU\,+\,EBIS for 12~weeks. Our primary outcomes are EBIS acceptability and feasibility, measured through questionnaires, interviews, and recruitment and retention statistics. Secondary outcomes are the engagement of target implementation mechanisms (clinician anxiety and self-efficacy related to implementation) and preliminary effectiveness of EBIS on implementation outcomes (adoption and fidelity) assessed via mixed methods (questionnaires, chart-stimulated recall, observer-coded role plays, and interviews).                                         Discussion               Outcomes from this study will yield insight into the feasibility and utility of directly targeting clinician anxiety and self-efficacy as mechanistic processes informing the implementation of suicide prevention EBPs. Results will inform a fully powered hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to test EBIS' effect on implementation and patient outcomes.

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence (AI) can be seen to be at an inflexion point in India, a country which is keen to adopt and exploit new technologies, but needs to carefully consider how they do this. AI is usually deployed with good intentions, to unlock value and create opportunities for the people; however it does not come without its challenges. There are a set of ethical\textendash social issues associated with AI, which include concerns around privacy, data protection, job displacement, historical bias and discrimination. Through a series of focus groups with knowledgeable people embedded in India and its culture, this research explores the ethical\textendash societal changes and challenges that India now faces. Further, it investigates whether the principles and practices of responsible research and innovation (RRI) might provide a framework to help identify and deal with these issues. The results show that the areas in which RRI could offer scope to improve this outlook include education, policy and governance, legislation and regulation, and innovation and industry practices. Some significant challenges described by participants included: the lack of awareness of AI by the public as well as policy makers; India's access and implementation of Western datasets, resulting in a lack of diversity, exacerbation of existing power asymmetries, increase in social inequality and the creation of bias; the potential replacement of jobs by AI. One option was to look at a hybrid approach, a mix of AI and humans, with expansion and upskilling of the current workforce. In terms of strategy, there seems to be a gap between the rhetoric of the government and what is seen on the ground, and therefore going forward there needs to be a much greater engagement with a wider audience of stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Evidence-based innovations can improve health outcomes, but only if successfully implemented. Implementation can be complex, highly susceptible to failure, costly and resource intensive. Internationally, there is an urgent need to improve the implementation of effective innovations. Successful implementation is best guided by implementation science, but organizations lack implementation know-how and have difficulty applying it. Implementation support is typically shared in static, non-interactive, overly academic guides and is rarely evaluated. In-person implementation facilitation is often soft-funded, costly, and scarce. This study seeks to improve effective implementation by (1) developing a first-in-kind digital tool to guide pragmatic, empirically based and self-directed implementation planning in real-time; and (2) exploring the tool's feasibility in six health organizations implementing different innovations.                                         Methods               Ideation emerged from a paper-based resource, The Implementation Game\textcopyright, and a revision called The Implementation Roadmap\textcopyright; both integrate core implementation components from evidence, models and frameworks to guide structured, explicit, and pragmatic planning. Prior funding also generated user personas and high-level product requirements. This study will design, develop, and evaluate the feasibility of a digital tool called The Implementation Playbook\textcopyright. In Phase 1, user-centred design and usability testing will inform tool content, visual interface, and functions to produce a minimum viable product. Phase 2 will explore the Playbook's feasibility in six purposefully selected health organizations sampled for maximum variation. Organizations will use the Playbook for up to 24 months to implement an innovation of their choosing. Mixed methods will gather: (i) field notes from implementation team check-in meetings; (ii) interviews with implementation teams about their experience using the tool; (iii) user free-form content entered into the tool as teams work through implementation planning; (iv) Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change questionnaire; (v) System Usability Scale; and (vi) tool metrics on how users progressed through activities and the time required to do so.                                         Discussion               Effective implementation of evidence-based innovations is essential for optimal health. We seek to develop a prototype digital tool and demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness across organizations implementing different innovations. This technology could fill a significant need globally, be highly scalable, and potentially valid for diverse organizations implementing various innovations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            To commemorate 40~years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme               Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges               . For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand               ethical               challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen B\"ohm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business               is               nature, and nature               is               business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human\textendash nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business\textendash nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their ``business and society'' assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40~years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that               Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth)               v.               Royal Dutch Shell               illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of ``consumer society'', a challenge to the dominant ``growth logic'' and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In the UK, several initiatives have resulted in the creation of local data warehouses of electronic patient records. Originally developed for commissioning and direct patient care, they are potentially useful for research, but little is known about them outside their home area. We describe one such local warehouse, the Whole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) database in NW London, and its potential for research as the ``Discover'' platform. We compare Discover with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a popular UK research database also based on linked primary care records.                                         Methods               We describe the key features of the Discover database, including scope, architecture and governance; descriptive analyses compare the population demographics and chronic disease prevalences with those in CPRD.                                         Results               As of June 2019, Discover held records for a total of 2.3 million currently registered patients, or 95\% of the NW London population; CPRD held records for over 11 million. The Discover population matches the overall age-sex distribution of the UK and CPRD but is more ethnically diverse. Most Discover chronic disease prevalences were comparable to the national rates. Unlike CPRD, Discover has identifiable care organisations and postcodes, allowing mapping and linkage to healthcare provider variables such as staffing, and includes contacts with social, community and mental health care. Discover also includes a consent-to-contact register of over 3000 volunteers to date for prospective studies.                                         Conclusions               Like CPRD, Discover has been a number of years in the making, is a valuable research tool, and can serve as a model for other areas developing similar data warehouses.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In common with many industries, the audiovisual sector is likely to be transformed by real-time graphic engines in combination with immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. This technological mix enables what is presently known as Virtual Production, introducing a new process~to the audiovisual professional, capable of fostering creativity, collaboration, and decision making, while at the same time increasing efficiency. The potential for Virtual Production to transform workflows and creative processes within large-scale productions in the audiovisual sector is significant and includes the prospective introduction of new capabilities for remote co-creation of content. However, barriers to democratisation need to be overcome, particularly in relation to adoption of the technology by small and medium independent productions that generally have limited access to resources and technical knowledge. Following an extensive study of the current literature and involvement in the research of professionals working in the field through online interviews, this article documents a first step towards filling this gap by investigating Virtual Production adoption scenarios for small and medium independent productions. The primary aim is to design intuitive, engaging, and effective solutions to address the needs of Directors, Cinematographers, and Producers.             Thanks to the valuable time and experience of industry professionals, this study has gathered user requirements for a Virtual Production design solution capable of facilitating location scouting and pre-production. A novel framework for remote exploration of target locations within immersive environments, co-created with relevant stakeholders, is presented to lay the foundations of future co-design work.},

However, we know little about the factors that influence or change entrepreneurs' digital identities. This study explores how entrepreneurs' digital identities change after a venture capital (VC) funding round. Applying a language-based text analysis to a large sample of tweets from 2,094 US entrepreneurs, we analyze entrepreneurs' digital identities before and after VC funding. The results of our analysis show that VC funding can impact the entrepreneur's digital identity in both a positive and a negative way. On the positive side, entrepreneurs increasingly use language indicative of higher self-confidence, positive emotions, and increased professionalism. On the negative side, we find that the entrepreneur's digital identity loses its authenticity, particularly with high funding amounts raised. The latter can be problematic as authenticity is shown to be a critical resource that entrepreneurs possess to build legitimacy and engage stakeholders in their venture. Our study contributes to research on the consequences of VC funding for entrepreneurs as well as to research on entrepreneurial digital identities. Practical implications exist for entrepreneurs managing their entrepreneurial identities over the course of venture development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There is an urgent need to learn how to appropriately integrate technologies into dementia care. The aims of this Delphi study were to project which technologies will be most prevalent in dementia care in five years, articulate potential benefits and risks, and identify specific options to mitigate risks. Participants were also asked to identify technologies that are most likely to cause value tensions and thus most warrant a conversation with an older person with mild dementia~when families are deciding about their use. Twenty-one interdisciplinary domain experts from academia and industry in aging and technology in the U.S. and Canada participated in a two-round online survey using the Delphi approach with an 84\% response rate and no attrition between rounds. Rankings were analyzed using frequency counts and written-in responses were thematically analyzed. Twelve technology categories were identified along with a detailed list of risks and benefits for each. Suggestions to mitigate the most commonly~raised risks are categorized as follows: intervene during design, make specific technical choices, build in choice and control, require data transparency, place restrictions on data use and ensure security, enable informed consent, and proactively educate users. This study provides information that is needed to navigate person-centered technology use in dementia care. The specific recommendations participants offered are relevant to designers, clinicians, researchers, ethicists, and policy makers and require proactive engagement from design through implementation.},

According to the recent report ``The Open Innovation Barometer'', released by the Economist, 90\% of organizations have either adopted or are planning to implement key open innovation practices by opening up their organizational boundaries to collaborative innovation in the next three years (The Economist Group 2022). However, the social and economic changes imposed by the emerging processes of transition towards a more digital and sustainable society raise questions on how the open innovation field of studies is evolving to meet new, emerging needs. By combining bibliometric techniques and content analysis, this study illustrates how this research community has evolved in the last 12 years. More specifically, this study provides a descriptive analysis of the literature on open innovation, defines its knowledge structure, and illustrates a representative picture of the theoretical landscape. Our analysis shows that attempts to consolidate established topics and theoretical approaches in this field of studies go hand in hand with the emergence of new conversations about unexplored dimensions of open innovation. We conclude this article by outlining some avenues for future research on how to conceptualize, theorize, and research (methods and analytical techniques) open innovation.},

Design thinking, a method of creative and collaborative problem solving originating in the tactics of designers, is a product design and development process that is, more and more, being used as a tool to move innovation forward and structure creation processes in diverse disciplines, from product development to food creation to social science research. Increasingly design thinking has become popular beyond the confines of creative and design disciplines and into the realm of wicked problems in social and ecological systems. While design thinking has many forms and applications, this study uses a refined version built upon the key themes of inspiration, ideation, and implementation as defined by Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO (2009), and situates it within the social science discipline\textemdash namely, systems thinking, organizational learning, and action research. Through a distilled design structure this flexible methodology combines insights from organizational development, social psychology, systems theory, and design research. By embedding learning and reflective practices into the structure of design thinking, a hybrid model of design thinking emerges that is a more effective tool for framing, setting in context, and solving these types of problems within teams.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Privacy is a central issue in the digitalization of society and directly concerns all Internet users. Privacy education is part of the picture of a more just digital society: it aims at making users more aware of the importance of their data and of the technical and financial tools and processes that involve their personal data. Nonetheless, privacy education is confronted with a paradox: while people perceive the importance of privacy, they seldom take action to actually protect their personal data. iBuddy is a narrative simulation-based session inspired by research evidence about the privacy paradox and aims to (a) enhancing awareness and (b) promoting the uptake of privacy-safe behaviors for secondary and higher students (age range 11\textendash 20). The paper presents the design and development of the simulation and of the following modular debriefing, as a case study in evidence-based collaborative instructional design and in the instructional used of digital technology. The evaluation of iBuddy, which combined a post-session satisfaction and perceived learning survey (               N               \,=\,978) and a follow-up survey (               N               \,=\,124), provides insights in the novel domain of privacy education. Results suggests that iBuddy sessions are engaging, effective and conducive to medium-term behavioral change, thus indirectly confirming the design assumptions about how to tackle the privacy paradox through a simulation-based approach.},

In this context, particular attention should be paid to the analysis of walkability. It has been proved that performing walking activities produces significant benefits both for physical and mental health, above all in elderly subjects. Besides traditional criteria adopted to evaluate walkability, we here propose a novel approach defined affective walkability. Being able to interpret the emotions of elderly walking in the urban environment and interacting with vehicles and other citizens, it is possible to evaluate if and to which extent an environment is perceived safe, comfortable and walkable. One way to obtain quantitative measures of walkability is to assess safety perception relying on physiological signals that can be considered indicators of emotions and mood. The assessment of affective walkability requires the design and performance of rigorous experiments to properly collect data. In this paper, the proposal of an affective walkability is presented and the developed experimental protocols, their performance and preliminary results are illustrated.},

As an action-oriented intervention, this Manifesto begins from the authors' experiences as social scientists working within interdisciplinary science and technology collaborations in agriculture and food. We draw from these experiences to: 1) explain what social scientists contribute to interdisciplinary agri-food tech collaborations; (2) describe barriers to substantive and meaningful collaboration; and (3) propose ways to overcome these barriers. We encourage funding bodies to develop mechanisms that ensure funded projects respect the integrity of social science expertise and incorporate its insights. We also call for the integration of social scientific questions and methods in interdisciplinary projects               from the outset               , and for a genuine curiosity on the part of STEM and social science researchers alike about the knowledge and skills each of us has to offer. We contend that cultivating such integration and curiosity within interdisciplinary collaborations will make them more enriching for all researchers involved, and more likely to generate socially beneficial outcomes.},

Brought together during Covid-19 through a shared interest and purpose concerning current and future developments in digital education, we offer knowledge and insight from our perspective as women leaders in academia, on co-designing futures in a postdigital world. Drawing on a duoethnographic research design, we reflected on our experiences as academic leaders and practitioners to systematically explore people, situations, and contexts through co-construction and dialogue. Our joint exploration uncovered themes of visibility, gravitas, and relationships. We provide evidence of the role co-design plays in our own practices, in our classrooms, and how our research design was strengthened through co-design. Finally, we offer an evolving model of co-design for leadership in higher education with communities of practice at its core.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               There is an increasing interest in clinical prediction tools that can achieve high prediction accuracy and provide explanations of the factors leading to increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, approaches to explaining complex machine learning (ML) models are rarely informed by end-user needs and user evaluations of model interpretability are lacking in the healthcare domain. We used extended revisions of previously-published theoretical frameworks to propose a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations. This new framework served as the basis for qualitative inquiries and design review sessions with critical care nurses and physicians that informed the design of a user-centered explanation display for an ML-based prediction tool.                                         Methods                                We used our framework to propose explanation displays for predictions from a                 p                 ediatric                 i                 ntensive                 c                 are                 u                 nit (PICU) in-hospital mortality risk model. Proposed displays were based on a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach based on feature influence, as determined by Shapley values. Focus group sessions solicited critical care provider feedback on the proposed displays, which were then revised accordingly.                                                        Results               The proposed displays were perceived as useful tools in assessing model predictions. However, specific explanation goals and information needs varied by clinical role and level of predictive modeling knowledge. Providers preferred explanation displays that required less information processing effort and could support the information needs of a variety of users. Providing supporting information to assist in interpretation was seen as critical for fostering provider understanding and acceptance of the predictions and explanations. The user-centered explanation display for the PICU in-hospital mortality risk model incorporated elements from the initial displays along with enhancements suggested by providers.                                         Conclusions               We proposed a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations for ML models. We used the proposed framework to motivate the design of a user-centered display of an explanation for predictions from a PICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Positive feedback from focus group participants provides preliminary support for the use of model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence as an approach to understand ML model predictions in healthcare and advances the discussion on how to effectively communicate ML model information to healthcare providers.},

All participants were recruited from two chemistry classes at a Danish elementary school in Copenhagen. A formative evaluation consisted of both a questionnaire, observations, and interviews. The questionnaire was inspired by the User Engagement Scale (UES) short-form. Designing a serious game for pupils with the aim to increase the understanding of molecular structures, is not an easy task. This serious game was to some extend able to engage the pupils within the subject of chemistry. The game itself was reported to be very engaging, but the specific learning outcomes remains uncertain. We can conclude that the serious game was visually appealing, the pupils were absorbed in the game, and wanted to continue playing. However, the designed serious game was also a bit confusing and made too difficult, resulting in frustrations for the pupils. Further, there are still some important challenges in how to increase the validity and reliability when evaluating serious games with children and adolescent as the users.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A new era is presently unfolding wherein both smart urbanism and sustainable urbanism processes and practices are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism under what has to be identified as data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. This flourishing field of research is profoundly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. It operates out of the understanding that advances in knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. This implies that the research problems within the field of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism are inherently too complex and dynamic to be addressed by single disciplines. As this field is not a specific direction of research, it does not have a unitary disciplinary framework in terms of a uniform set of the academic and scientific disciplines from which the underlying theories can be drawn. These theories constitute a unified foundation for the practice of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary framework. With that in regard, this paper identifies, describes, discusses, evaluates, and thematically organizes the core academic and scientific disciplines underlying the field of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. This work provides an important lens through which to understand the set of established and emerging disciplines that have high integration, fusion, and application potential for informing the processes and practices of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. As such, it provides fertile insights into the core foundational principles of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism as an applied domain in terms of its scientific, technological, and computational strands. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in its original contribution to the body of foundational knowledge of an emerging field of urban planning and development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper aims to define a theoretical background for investigating greenwashing from a business economic perspective. We consider possible research questions in the relevant field of study, which is business economics studies. The first research step proposes a path that will orient scholars to the multifaceted perspectives of greenwashing. The second step analyzes the main theories that can support researchers and might motivate the possible greenwashing strategies. The third step highlights the potential link between greenwashing, reputational and relational capital, and a broad concept of value that includes the social dimension. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that highlights some emerging research issues and anticipates the effects of greenwashing.~Considering that self-regulation is not effective in reducing the gap between substantive and symbolic behaviors, the main practical implication of this study lies in addressing the need for stronger regulation and effective legal enforcement, not only to improve mandatory environmental disclosure but also to develop an audit process of such disclosure.~Our analysis offers a number of suggestions for future research. Considering the centrality of disclosure in the theoretical framework we defined for greenwashing, future research could adopt the legitimacy theory perspective to focus on the role of mandatory environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) disclosure as well. Further, our conceptual framework highlights a possible research issue that investigates how a social value destruction resulting from inconsistent environmental strategies, may impact shareholders' economic value.},

This paper provides core definitions, research dimensions, and an overall vision for the future of HBI as developed through consensus among 25 interdisciplinary experts in a series of facilitated workshops. Three primary areas contribute to and require attention in HBI research: humans (human experiences, performance, and well-being), buildings (building design and operations), and technologies (sensing, inference, and awareness). Three critical interdisciplinary research domains intersect these areas: control systems and decision making, trust and collaboration, and modeling and simulation. Finally, at the core, it is vital for HBI research to center on and support equity, privacy, and sustainability. Compelling research questions are posed for each primary area, research domain, and core principle. State-of-the-art methods used in HBI studies are discussed, and examples of original research are offered to illustrate opportunities for the advancement of HBI research.},

The present study used path dependency as a theoretical lens to investigate a single longitudinal case study of a leading manufacturing company based on in-depth interviews with senior executives and managers. The analysis contributes to extending the digital servitization and path-dependence literature by proposing four path-breaking mechanisms: (1) organizational reconfiguration, (2) reconfiguration of value offerings, (3) opportunity exploration, and (4) knowledge reconfiguration. The framework developed based on these mechanisms generated valuable insights for manufacturing firms seaking to to break away from their dominant paths.},

The most sensitive group are people with hearing disabilities, but many others also find background sounds annoying. To address this problem SVT has added Enhanced Speech, a feature with lower background noise, to a number of TV programs in VOD service SVT Play. As a result, when the number of programs with the Enhanced Speech feature increased, the level of audio complaints to customer service decreased. The Enhanced Speech feature got the rating 8.3/10 in a survey with 86 participants. The rating for possible future usage was 9.0/10. In this article we describe this feature's design and development process, as well as its technical specification, limitations and future development opportunities.},

Similar to software products, educational modules require the establishment and integration of innovative methods, tools and procedures into well-defined processes aiming at producing flexible, adaptable and high-quality products. In this sense, content modeling activity plays a fundamental role in the development of educational modules, providing a way to structure the relevant parts of the learning content. Motivated by this scenario, we propose "Equation missing"                              \textemdash an approach for modeling learning content, capable of addressing conceptual, instructional and didactic issues altogether, in an integrated way. By means of a set of models, "Equation missing"                              helps the author in determining the relevant parts of the learning content, providing a systematic way to structure the concepts and related information. "Equation missing"                              also explores the idea of               open specifications               , providing support for the definition of dynamic contexts of learning. Besides that, the translation of "Equation missing"                              models into machine-readable specifications, automatically or by hand, makes possible interoperability and promotes reusability. "Equation missing"                              has been applied in the development of educational modules for different domains.

This article documents a research process focusing on co-design of innovative solutions for Virtual Production relying on immersive technologies. Two remote collaborative workshops were organized involving audiovisual professionals covering different roles in different phases of the making process of audiovisual production. A range of innovative design concepts was generated as part of the research following group-based iterative discussion and evaluation. The study has contributed a set of innovative design solutions in relation to applications of immersive technologies in the audiovisual industry. The authors argue that the methods adopted have the potential to serve as a blueprint for design and implementation of future remote collaborative co-design processes in relation to audiovisual studies and, more generally, across disciplinary boundaries.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper makes a case for digital mental health and provides insights into how digital technologies can enhance (but not replace) existing mental health services. We describe digital mental health by presenting a suite of digital technologies (from digital interventions to the application of artificial intelligence). We discuss the benefits of digital mental health, for example, a digital intervention can be an accessible stepping-stone to receiving support. The paper does, however, present less-discussed benefits with new concepts such as `poly-digital', where many different apps/features (e.g. a sleep app, mood logging app and a mindfulness app, etc.) can each address different factors of wellbeing, perhaps resulting in an aggregation of marginal gains. Another benefit is that digital mental health offers the ability to collect high-resolution real-world client data and provide client monitoring outside of therapy sessions. These data can be collected using digital phenotyping and ecological momentary assessment techniques (i.e. repeated mood or scale measures via an app). This allows digital mental health tools and real-world data to inform therapists and enrich face-to-face sessions. This can be referred to as blended care/adjunctive therapy where service users can engage in `channel switching' between digital and non-digital (face-to-face) interventions providing a more integrated service. This digital integration can be referred to as a kind of `digital glue' that helps join up the in-person sessions with the real world. The paper presents the challenges, for example, the majority of mental health apps are maybe of inadequate quality and there is a lack of user retention. There are also ethical challenges, for example, with the perceived `over-promotion' of screen-time and the perceived reduction in care when replacing humans with `computers', and the trap of `technological solutionism' whereby technology can be naively presumed to solve all problems. Finally, we argue for the need to take an evidence-based, systems thinking and co-production approach in the form of stakeholder-centred design when developing digital mental health services based on technologies. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of ideas from many different disciplines as well as the framework for blended care using `channel switching' to showcase how digital data and technology can enrich physical services. Another contribution is the emergence of `poly-digital' and a discussion on the challenges of digital mental health, specifically `digital ethics'.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               As the uptake of health information technologies increased, most healthcare organizations have become producers of big data. A growing number of hospitals are investing in the development of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities. If the promises associated with these capabilities are high, how hospitals create value from it remains unclear. The present study undertakes a scoping review of existing research on BDA use in hospitals to describe the path from BDA capabilities (BDAC)~to value and its associated challenges.                                         Methods               This scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's 5 stages framework. A systematic search strategy was adopted to identify relevant articles in Scopus and Web of Science. Data charting and extraction were performed following an analytical framework that builds on the resource-based view of the firm to~describe the path from BDA capabilities to value in hospitals.                                         Results                                Of 1,478 articles identified, 94 were included. Most of them are experimental research (                 n                 =69) published in medical (                 n                 =66) or computer science journals (                 n                 =28). The main value targets associated with the use of BDA are improving the quality of decision-making (                 n                 =56) and driving innovation (                 n                 =52) which apply mainly to care (                 n                 =67) and administrative (                 n                 =48) activities. To reach these targets, hospitals need to adequately combine BDA capabilities and value creation mechanisms (VCM) to enable knowledge generation and drive its assimilation. Benefits are endpoints of the value creation process. They are expected in all articles but realized in a few instances only (                 n                 =19).                                                        Conclusions               This review confirms the value creation potential of BDA solutions in hospitals. It also shows the organizational challenges that prevent hospitals from generating actual benefits from BDAC-building efforts. The configuring of strategies, technologies and organizational capabilities underlying the development of value-creating BDA solutions should become a priority area for research, with focus on the mechanisms that can drive the alignment of BDA and organizational strategies, and the development of organizational capabilities to support knowledge generation and assimilation.},

Studies have shown that nostalgic memories trigger positive emotions, which can provide better experiences for elderly people in learning and using new technology. However, the use of nostalgia in TUI for elderly people has been little and therefore the understanding on how nostalgia can contribute in TUI promoting technology acceptance among elderly people is limited. In order to address this knowledge gap, in this study we have created a nostalgic TUI application for elderly people through three iterations of design, development and evaluation. The results show that by adopting the element of nostalgia into the TUI application, elderly people could learn to use new technology in a more intuitive way. They could relate the new technology to their old positive memories. However, they had expectations that the TUI application would work exactly like the old fashioned way. Through the research process, we gathered and reflected on the lessons learned, which can serve as guidelines for using the concept of nostalgia in designing TUI application for elderly people's technology acceptance.},

A sample of 20 applications received by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) between 2009 and 2019 were selected, with examples from weed and insect targets. Expressions of uncertainty were identified by applicants as well as the EPA staff assessment report of the application, and the final decision document prepared by the Authority's committee. The most common risk uncertainties expressed were potential direct non-target effects (85\%), cultural risks (75\%), and whether there were existing (and possibly effective) natural enemies of the target already present in the new range (70\%). Food web indirect effects and adequacy of host range testing were also mentioned in more than half of the case study applications and associated documents. For uncertainty relating to benefits, 75\% of case studies mentioned uncertainty about the efficacy of the proposed biological control agent, or if the agent would be successful by establishing and spreading (60\%). For several of the case studies questions were raised about the method of cost: benefit analyses that had been presented in the application. Recommendations for future research are presented.},

However, designing national economic policies that support advancement across multiple Sustainable Development Goals is hindered by the complexities of multi-sector economies and often conflicting policies. To address this, we introduce a national-scale design framework that can enable policymakers to sift through complex, non-linear, multi-sector policy spaces to identify efficient policy portfolios that balance economic, social, and environmental goals. The framework combines economy-wide sustainability simulation and artificial intelligence-driven multiobjective, multi-SDG policy search and machine learning. The framework can support multi-sector, multi-actor policy deliberation to screen efficient policy portfolios. We demonstrate the utility of the framework for a case study of Egypt by identifying policy portfolios that achieve efficient mixes of poverty and inequality reduction, economic growth, and climate change mitigation. The results show that integrated policy strategies can help achieve sustainable development while balancing adverse economic, social, and political impacts of reforms.},

More specifically, it explores how prioritizing the capturing of IP as a central researcher responsibility can cause disruptions to research relationships and project outcomes. We argue that boundary-making processes associated with IP create a particular context through which responsibility can, and must, be located and cultivated by researchers working within transdisciplinary collaborations. We draw from interview data and situated IP practices from a transdisciplinary co-design project in Aotearoa New Zealand to illustrate how IP is a fluid               boundary-requiring-and-producing object               that impels researchers into its management, and produces tensions that need to be noticed and skillfully navigated within research relations. We propose               located response-ability               as a conceptual tool and practice to reposition IP within the relations that make up a transdisciplinary co-design project, as opposed to prioritizing IP by default without recognizing its possible impacts on collaborative relations and other project aims and accountabilities. This can support researchers practicing responsible innovation in making everyday decisions on how to protect potential IP without disrupting the collaborative relations that make the creation of potential IP possible, and the existence of protected IP relevant and beneficial to project collaborators and wider societal actors. This may help to ensure that societal benefits can be generated, and positive science\textendash society relationships prioritized and preserved, in the design of new AgTech.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In this paper, we propose a methodology to maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary cooperation in AI research groups. Firstly, we build the case for the importance of interdisciplinarity in research groups as the best means to tackle the social implications brought about by AI systems, against the backdrop of the EU Commission proposal for an               Artificial Intelligence Act               . As we are an interdisciplinary group, we address the multi-faceted implications of the mass-scale diffusion of AI-driven technologies. The result of our exercise lead us to postulate the necessity of a behavioural theory that standardizes the interaction process of interdisciplinary groups. In light of this, we conduct a review of the existing approaches to interdisciplinary research on AI appliances, leading to the development of methodologies like               ethics-by-design               and               value-sensitive design               , evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. We then put forth an iterative process theory hinging on a narrative approach consisting of four phases: (i) definition of the hypothesis space, (ii) building-up of a common lexicon, (iii) scenario-building, (iv) interdisciplinary self-assessment. Finally, we identify the most relevant fields of application for such a methodology and discuss possible case studies.},

We sought to understand factors associated with short and long term mobility among women in fishing communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. From 2018 through 2019 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of women aged 15~years and above, randomly selected from a census of six fishing villages, around Lake Victoria. Data collected included: demographics, risky sexual behaviour on the most recent trip, and travel behaviour in the previous 4~months. Mobility was recorded as any overnight trip outside the participant's village. A two-level multinomial logistic regression model was used to determine the associated factors. A total of 901 participants were enrolled, of whom 645 (71.6\%) reported travelling (53.4\%; short and 18.2\% long term trips). Five factors were associated with long term travel: age, travel purpose, frequency of travel, sexual behaviour while travelling, and destination. Trips made by women aged 46\textendash 75~years were less likely to be long term. Long term trips were more common if the trip was to visit, rather than to trade, and more common for women who reported one or two trips rather than three or more trips. Women who made long term trips were more likely to engage in unprotected sex while on a trip. Women who travelled to a regional town/district or another town/district were more likely to take long term trips. The factors associated with travel duration among women living in fishing communities could inform planning of future health care interventions in these communities.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Older adults with hip fracture often require extensive post-surgery care across multiple sectors, making follow-up care even more important to ensure an ideal recovery. With the increased adoption of technology, patient-clinician digital health interventions can potentially improve post-surgery outcomes of hip fracture patients by helping them and their caregivers better understand the various aspects of their care, post-hip fracture surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the available literature on the impact of hip fracture-specific, patient-clinician digital health interventions on patient outcomes and health care delivery processes. We also aimed to identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake and implementation of these technologies and to provide strategies for improved use of these digital health interventions.                                         Methods               We conducted a scoping review following the six stages of Arksey and O'Malley's framework and following the PRISMA-ScR reporting format. Searches were conducted in five databases. In addition to hand searching for relevant studies from the references of all included studies, we also conducted a grey literature search to identify relevant primary studies. Screening of titles and abstracts as well as full texts were performed independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers also performed the data extraction of the included studies.                                         Results                                After screening 3,638 records, 20 articles met the criteria and 1 article was identified through hand searching. Various patient-clinician digital health interventions were described including telehealth /telerehabilitation programs (                 n                 \,=\,6), care transition /follow-up interventions (                 n                 \,=\,5), online resources (                 n                 \,=\,2), and wearable devices /sensor monitoring (                 n                 \,=\,1). Outcomes were varied and included functional status, gait/mobility, quality of life, psychological factors, satisfaction, survival/complications, caregiver outcomes, compliance, technology-user interactions, and feedback on the use of the digital health interventions. For clinicians, a key barrier to the use of the digital health interventions was the                 acceptability of the technology                 . However, the                 usefulness of the digital health intervention                 by clinicians was seen as both a barrier and an enabler. For patients and caregivers, all the themes were seen as both a barrier and an enabler depending on the study. These themes included: 1)                 availability and access,                 2)                 usability                 , 3)                 knowledge and skills                 , 4)                 acceptability                 , and 5)                 usefulness of the digital health intervention.                                                        Conclusion               Many behavioural factors affect the use of patient-clinician digital health interventions. However, a specific attention should be focused on the acceptability of the technology by the clinicians to encourage uptake of the digital health interventions. The results of this scoping review can help to better understand the factors that may be targeted to increase the use of these technologies by clinicians, patients, and caregivers.},

One key limitation of influential frameworks of RI is that they tend to neglect some key ethical issues raised by innovation, as well as major normative dimensions of the notion of responsibility. We explain how IE could enrich RI by stressing the more important role that ethical analysis should play in RI. We focus on two transversal issues of IE: the issue of redrawing conceptual boundaries, especially the topic of the artificialization of the world, and the issue of responsibility, especially the notion of total responsibility. We address these two issues from the thematic perspective of IE, thereby generating lessons learnt for RI. These two examples are taken as illustrations and blueprint of the dialogue that should take place between the two fields.},

The findings discuss the significance of critical seven-step in DDI, ranging from conceptualisation to commercialisation of innovative data products. The results reveal that the steps in DDI are sequential, but they are all interlinked. The proposed seven-step DDI process with solid evidence from the UK manufacturing and research implications based on dynamic capability theory, institutional theory and TOE framework establish the building blocks for future studies and industry practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Tropical coastal marine ecosystems (TCMEs) are rich in biodiversity and provide many ecosystem services, including carbon storage, shoreline protection, and food. Coastal areas are home to increasing numbers of people and population growth is expected to continue, putting TCMEs under pressure from development as well as broader environmental changes associated with climate change, e.g. sea level rise and ocean acidification. Attention to TCMEs by conservation organizations has increased and although a variety of interventions to promote conservation and sustainable development of TCMEs have been implemented, evidence regarding the outcomes of these\textemdash for people or ecosystems\textemdash is scattered and unclear. This study takes a systematic mapping approach to identify articles that examine the ecological and social outcomes associated with conservation interventions in TCMEs; specifically in coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass habitats.                                         Methods               We developed a comprehensive framework of conservation interventions and outcomes, drawing on existing frameworks and related evidence synthesis projects, as well as interviews with marine conservation practitioners. We modified existing frameworks to: (i) include features of TCME that are not fully captured in existing frameworks; and (ii) further specify and/or regroup existing interventions or outcomes. We developed a search string informed by habitat, geography, interventions, and outcomes of interest, to search the peer-reviewed primary literature in four bibliographic databases and the grey literature on relevant institutional websites. All searches will be conducted in English. We will screen returned articles at the title and abstract level. Included articles will be screened at full text level and data coding will follow. Number of articles and reasons for excluding at full text level screening will be recorded. At each phase (title and abstract screening, full text screening, data coding), articles will be assessed independently by two members of the review team. Coded data will be reported in a narrative review and a database accessible through an open access, searchable data portal. We will summarize trends in the evidence base, identify interventions and outcomes where evidence can be further assessed in subsequent systematic reviews and where gaps in the literature exist, and discuss the implications of research gaps and gluts for TCME conservation policy, practice, and future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objectives               To define requirements that condition trust in artificial intelligence (AI) as clinical decision support in radiology from the perspective of various stakeholders and to explore ways to fulfil these requirements.                                         Methods               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-five respondents\textemdash nineteen directly involved in the development, implementation, or use of AI applications in radiology and six working with AI in other areas of healthcare. We designed the questions to explore three themes: development and use of AI, professional decision-making, and management and organizational procedures connected to AI. The transcribed interviews were analysed in an iterative coding process from open coding to theoretically informed thematic coding.                                         Results               We identified four aspects of trust that relate to reliability, transparency, quality verification, and inter-organizational compatibility. These aspects fall under the categories of substantial and procedural requirements.                                         Conclusions               Development of appropriate levels of trust in AI in healthcare is complex and encompasses multiple dimensions of requirements. Various stakeholders will have to be involved in developing AI solutions for healthcare and radiology to fulfil these requirements.                                         Clinical relevance statement               For AI to achieve advances in radiology, it must be given the opportunity to support, rather than replace, human expertise. Support requires trust. Identification of aspects and conditions for trust allows developing AI implementation strategies that facilitate advancing the field.                                         Key Points                                \textbullet{} Dimensions of procedural and substantial demands that need to be fulfilled to foster appropriate levels of trust in AI in healthcare are conditioned on aspects related to reliability, transparency, quality verification, and inter-organizational compatibility.                                               \textbullet Creating the conditions for trust to emerge requires the involvement of various stakeholders, who will have to compensate the problem's inherent complexity by finding and promoting well-defined solutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Anu Bradford has described the European Union's ability to externalise its norms and standards as the so-called Brussels effect. We apply the Brussels effect to select issues discussed via the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and show that its capacity to project power stems not only from the EU's market size but also from its domestic decision-making structure. The political capital accumulated in the EU's consensus-based and inclusive deliberations functions as an effective instrument for motivating other states to adopt European regulations, as legislative acts resulting from European inter-institutional and multi-level policy-making hold high standards of legal certainty and signal European strategic goals and political commitments~credibly. Knowing that European consensus is an important condition for externalisation, Brussels can facilitate consensus by calling for internal compromise in order to be able to take the European compromise to the international stage. Thus, the internal and external dimensions of the Brussels effect are mutually reinforcing. This twofold appearance demarcates it from the California effect and the Beijing effect.},

This increased complexity is impacting the management of models necessary for designing cyber-physical systems that are able to take into account a number of ``-ilities'', such that they are safe and secure and ultimately resilient to disruption of service. We propose an ontological metamodel for system design that augments an already existing industry metamodel to capture the relationships between various model elements (requirements, interfaces, physical, and functional) and safety, security, and resilient considerations. Employing this metamodel leads to more cohesive and structured modeling efforts with an overall increase in scalability, usability, and unification of already existing models. In turn, this leads to a mission-oriented perspective in designing security defenses and resilience mechanisms to combat undesirable behaviors. We illustrate this metamodel in an open-source GraphQL implementation, which can interface with a number of modeling languages. We support our proposed metamodel with a detailed demonstration using an oil and gas pipeline model.},

We respond to the above and develop prototype groupware for real-time collaborative editing of raster and vector images in a web browser. To better understand the requirements, we conduct a preliminary user study and establish communication and synchronization as key elements. The existing groupware for text documents or presentations handles the above through well-established techniques. However, those cannot be extended as it is for raster or vector graphics manipulation. To this end, we develop a document model that is maintained by a server and is delivered and synchronized to multiple clients. Our prototypical implementation is based on a scalable client\textendash server architecture: using WebGL for interactive browser-based rendering and WebSocket connections to maintain synchronization. We evaluate our work qualitatively through a post-deployment user study for three different scenarios. For quantitative evaluation, we perform a thorough performance measure on both client and server side, thereby identifying design recommendations for future concurrent image-editing software(s).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mobile health (m-Health) resources are emerging as a significant tool to overcome mental health support access barriers due to their ability to rapidly reach and provide support to individuals in need of mental health support. m-Health provides an approach to adapt and initiate mental health support at precise moments, when they are most likely to be effective for the individual. However, poor adoption of mental health apps in the real world suggests that new approaches to optimising the quality of m-Health interventions are critically needed in order to realise the potential translational benefits for mental health support. The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision. Here, we illustrate this approach in a case study, review implementation issues that need to be considered while conducting an MRT, and provide a checklist for mental health m-Health intervention developers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             As artificial intelligence (AI) thrives and propagates through modern life, a key question to ask is how to include humans in future AI? Despite human involvement at every stage of the production process from conception and design through to implementation, modern AI is still often criticized for its ``black box'' characteristics. Sometimes, we do not know what really goes on inside or how and why certain conclusions are met. Future AI will face many dilemmas and ethical issues unforeseen by their creators beyond those commonly discussed (e.g., trolley problems and variants of it) and to which solutions cannot be hard-coded and are often still up for debate. Given the sensitivity of such social and ethical dilemmas and the implications of these for human society at large, when and if our AI make the ``wrong'' choice we need to understand how they got there in order to make corrections and prevent recurrences. This is particularly true in situations where human livelihoods are at stake (e.g., health, well-being, finance, law) or when major individual or household decisions are taken. Doing so requires opening up the ``black box'' of AI; especially as they act, interact, and adapt in a human world and how they interact with other AI in this world. In this article, we argue for the application of cognitive architectures for ethical AI. In particular, for their potential contributions to AI transparency, explainability, and accountability. We need to understand how our AI get to the solutions they do, and we should seek to do this on a deeper level in terms of the machine-equivalents of motivations, attitudes, values, and so on. The path to future AI is long and winding but it could arrive faster than we think. In order to harness the positive potential outcomes of AI for humans and society (and avoid the negatives), we need to understand AI more fully in the first place and we expect this will simultaneously contribute towards greater understanding of their human counterparts also.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Digital health interventions (DHIs) have frequently been highlighted as one way to respond to increasing levels of mental health problems in children and young people. Whilst many are developed to address existing mental health problems, there is also potential for DHIs to address prevention and early intervention. However, there are currently limitations in the design and reporting of the development, evaluation and implementation of preventive DHIs that can limit their adoption into real-world practice. This scoping review aimed to examine existing evidence-based DHI interventions and review how well the research literature described factors that researchers need to include in their study designs and reports to support real-world implementation. A search was conducted for relevant publications published from 2013 onwards. Twenty-one different interventions were identified from 30 publications, which took a universal (               n               \,=\,12), selective (               n               \,=\,3) and indicative (               n               \,=\,15) approach to preventing poor mental health. Most interventions targeted adolescents, with only two studies including children aged {$\leq$}10\,years. There was limited reporting of user co-design involvement in intervention development. Barriers and facilitators to implementation varied across the delivery settings, and only a minority reported financial costs involved in delivering the intervention. This review found that while there are continued attempts to design and evaluate DHIs for children and young people, there are several points of concern. More research is needed with younger children and those from poorer and underserved backgrounds. Co-design processes with children and young people should be recognised and reported as a necessary component within DHI research as they are an important factor in the design and development of interventions, and underpin successful adoption and implementation. Reporting the type and level of human support provided as part of the intervention is also important in enabling the sustained use and implementation of DHIs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Online learning has become an everyday form of learning for many students across different disciplines, including STEM subjects in the setting of higher education. Studying in these settings requires students to self-regulate their learning to a higher degree as compared to campus-based education. A vital aspect of self-regulated learning is the application of goal-setting strategies. Universities act to support students' goal-setting through the achievement of course learning outcomes, which work both as a promise and metric of academic achievement. However, a lack of clear integration between course activities and course learning outcomes leaves a dissonance between students' study efforts and the course progress. This demo study presents a student-centered learning analytics dashboard aimed at assisting students in their achievement of course learning goals in the setting of STEM higher education. The dashboard was designed using a design science methodological approach. Thirty-seven students have contributed to its development and evaluation during different stages of the design process, including the conceptual iterative design and prototyping. The preliminary results show that students found the tool to be easy to use and useful for the achievement of the course goals.},

This new-generation AI/DS build on the consilience and universology of science, technology and engineering. In particular, it synergizes AI and data science, inspiring Trans-AI/DS (i.e., Trans-AI, Trans-DS and their hybridization) thinking, vision, paradigms, approaches and practices. Trans-AI/DS feature their               transformative               (or transformational),               transdisciplinary               , and               translational               AI/DS in terms of thinking, paradigms, methodologies, technologies, engineering, and practices. Here, we discuss these important paradigm shifts and directions. Trans-AI/DS encourage big and outside-the-box thinking beyond the classic AI, data-driven, model-based, statistical, shallow and deep learning hypotheses, methodologies and developments. They pursue foundational and original AI/DS thinking, theories and practices from the essence of intelligences and complexities inherent in humans, nature, society, and their creations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Social robotic platforms are increasingly entering into human social practices, but to date the question of control and direction of innovation processes surrounding social robotics is still highly debated. In this paper I seek to make a two-fold contribution. Firstly, I critically discuss the ``Collingridge Dilemma'', also known as the ``dilemma of control'' in Science and Technologies Studies, and contemporary efforts to address such a dilemma. I demonstrate how such efforts have neglected some wider implications of the dilemma, whose relevance is instead crucial for addressing ethical implications in social robotics. Secondly, to help improve the understanding of control in social robotics, I investigate two guiding principles that have been identified in responsible innovation literature, e.g., inclusion and responsiveness, and I identify potential methods and paradigms to put them into practice. The general aim of this paper is thus to bridge the gap between the theoretical assumptions of responsible innovation and its realisation in practice, as well as to explicitly integrate social robotics with an ethical dimension that can improve the inclusiveness, transdisciplinarity, and social sustainability of this emerging field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Scholars, policymakers and organizations in the EU, especially at the level of the European Commission, have turned their attention to the ethics of (trustworthy and human-centric) Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there has been little reflexivity on (1) the history of the ethics of AI as an institutionalized phenomenon and (2) the comparison to similar episodes of ``ethification'' in other fields, to highlight common (unresolved) challenges.             Contrary to some mainstream narratives, which stress how the increasing attention to ethical aspects of AI is due to the fast pace and increasing risks of technological developments, Science and Technology Studies(STS)-informed perspectives highlight that the rise of institutionalized assessment methods indicates a need for governments to gain more control of scientific research and to bring EU institutions closer to the public on controversies related to emerging technologies.             This article analyzes how different approaches of the recent past (i.e. bioethics, technology assessment (TA) and ethical, legal and social (ELS) research, Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)) followed one another, often ``in the name of ethics'', to address previous criticisms and/or to legitimate certain scientific and technological research programs. The focus is on how a brief history of the institutionalization of these approaches can provide insights into present challenges to the ethics of AI related to methodological issues, mobilization of expertise and public participation.},

In the post-Covid-19 era, the entities that are best positioned to capitalize on these innovations are large firms, which use digital platforms and big data to orchestrate vast ecosystems of users and extract market share across industry sectors. Nonetheless, these technologies also have the potential to democratize ownership, broaden political-economic participation, and reduce environmental harms. We articulate the potential sociotechnical pathways in this high-stakes crossroads by analyzing cellular agriculture, an exemplary 4th Industrial Revolution technology that synergizes computer science, biopharma, tissue engineering, and food science to grow cultured meat, dairy, and egg products from cultured cells and/or genetically modified yeast. Our exploration of this space involved multi-sited ethnographic research in both (a) the cellular agriculture community and (b) alternative economic organizations devoted to open source licensing, member-owned cooperatives, social financing, and platform business models. Upon discussing how these latter approaches could potentially facilitate alternative sociotechnical pathways in cellular agriculture, we reflect upon the broader implications of this work with respect to the 4th Industrial Revolution and the enduring need for public policy reform.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the digital era, third-party food delivery operations are very popular all around the world. However, to achieve a sustainable operation for food delivery businesses is a challenging issue. Motivated by the fact that there is a lack of consolidated view towards the topic in the literature, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify how to achieve a sustainable operation for third-party food delivery and highlight the recent advances in this important area with the discussion of real-world practices. In this study, first, we review the relevant literature and apply the triple bottom line (TBL) framework to classify prior studies into economic sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and multi-dimensional sustainability. We then identify three major research gaps, including inadequate investigation on the restaurant's preferences and decisions, superficial understanding on the environmental performance, and limited examination on the multi-dimensional sustainability in the third-party food delivery operations. Finally, based on the reviewed literature and observed industrial practices, we propose five future areas that deserve an in-depth further investigation. They are namely applications of digital technologies, behaviors and decisions of the restaurants, risk management, TBL, and post-coronavirus pandemic.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article provides a systematic review of the extensive and fragmented literature focused on Digital Transformation (DT) and marketing by identifying the main themes and perspectives (i.e., employees, customers, and business processes) studied by previous research. By mapping the DT literature in the area of marketing, 117 articles, published between 2014 and 2020, have been identified. Through the adoption of a content analysis process, a multi-dimensional framework synthesizing the DT and marketing binomial has been provided. Results identify two thematical patterns: the macro-themes, related to the main digital technologies adopted within the marketing function, and the micro-themes, related to the effect/impact of these technologies on marketing processes and activities. Concerning the micro-themes, findings show how they have mainly studied from the customer and business processes' perspectives, thus identifying an interesting research gap related to the analysis of the DT-marketing phenomenon from the employees' standpoint. Based on these results, the paper derives a research agenda by also providing theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, it is the first systematic and thematic review focused on DT and marketing. In particular, it analyses this binomial from a broad and comprehensive perspective, thus offering a synergistic framework of the existing literature, which allows an inclusive vision and understanding about the phenomenon. At the managerial level, the paper could help organizations to enhance their awareness about marketing areas and processes that could better benefit from digitalization, thus driving the overall transition of firms towards DT.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Augmented reality (AR) has a number of applications in industry, but remote assistance represents one of the most prominent and widely studied use cases. Notwithstanding, although the set of functionalities supporting the communication between remote experts and on-site operators grew over time, the way in which remote assistance is delivered has not evolved yet to unleash the full potential of AR technology. The expert typically guides the operator step-by-step, and basically uses AR-based hints to visually support voice instructions. With this approach, skilled human resources may go under-utilized, as the time an expert invests in the assistance corresponds to the time needed by the operator to execute the requested operations. The goal of this work is to introduce a new approach to remote assistance that takes advantage of AR functionalities separately proposed in academic works and commercial products to re-organize the guidance workflow, with the aim to increase the operator's autonomy and, thus, optimize the use of expert's time. An AR-powered remote assistance platform able to support the devised approach is also presented. By means of a user study, this approach was compared to traditional step-by-step guidance, with the aim to estimate what is the potential of AR that is still unexploited. Results showed that with the new approach it is possible to reduce the time investment for the expert, allowing the operator to autonomously complete the assigned tasks in a time comparable to step-by-step guidance with a negligible need for further support.},

Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grown\textemdash however, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed.

All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Nature-based interventions (NbIs) for climate change mitigation include a diverse set of interventions aimed at conserving, restoring, and/or managing natural and modified ecosystems to improve their ability to store and sequester carbon and avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Recent projections estimate that terrestrial NbIs can lead to more than one-third of the climate change mitigation necessary to meet the Paris Climate Agreement by 2030. Further, these interventions can provide co-benefits in the form of social and ecological outcomes. Despite growing recognition of the potential benefits, a clear characterization of the distribution and occurrence of evidence which supports linkages between different types of NbIs and outcomes for climate change mitigation, ecosystems, and people remains poorly understood.                                         Methods               This systematic map assesses the evidence base on the links between NbIs and climate change mitigation, social, and ecological outcomes in tropical and subtropical terrestrial regions. We searched three bibliographic databases, 65 organization websites, and conducted backward citation chasing within 39 existing evidence syntheses to identify relevant articles. Additionally, we reached out to key informants for additional sources of evidence. We then used machine learning to rank returned results by relevance at the title and abstract stage and manually screened for inclusion using predefined criteria at the title, abstract, and full text stages. We extracted relevant meta-data from included articles using an a priori coding scheme. Lastly, we conducted a targeted, complementary search to identify relevant review and synthesis articles to provide broader context for the findings of the systematic map.                                         Review findings               We included 948 articles in this systematic map. Most of the evidence base (56\%) examined links between protection, natural resource management, and restoration interventions with changes to `proxy' outcomes for climate change mitigation (changes to land condition, land cover, and/or land use). Other areas with high occurrence of articles included linkages between interventions within natural resource management and trees in croplands categories and changes to aboveground carbon storage and/or sequestration (17\% of articles). A key knowledge gap was on measured changes in GHG emissions across all intervention types (6\% of articles). Overall, articles in the evidence base did not often assess changes in co-benefits alongside direct or indirect changes for climate change mitigation (32\%). In most cases, the evidence base contained studies which did not explicitly test for causal linkages using appropriate experimental or quasi-experimental designs.                                         Conclusions               The evidence base for NbIs is significant and growing; however, key gaps in knowledge hamper the ability to inform ongoing and future investment and implementation at scale. More comprehensive evidence is needed to support causal inference between NbIs and direct outcomes for climate change mitigation to better determine additionality, permanence, leakage, and other unintended consequences. Similarly, priorities emerging from this map include the need for coordinated and harmonized efforts to collect diverse data types to better understand whether and how other outcomes (e.g. social, ecological) of NbIs can be achieved synergistically with mitigation objectives. Understanding potential benefits and trade-offs of NbIs is particularly urgent to inform rapidly expanding carbon markets for nature.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The global imperative has increased in recent years for international firms to respond to major threats such as unintended environmental, social, and economic problems arising from ecological destruction, population growth, and economic activity. To respond to this confluence that has created an emerging existential crisis, we identify that a globalizing circular economy (CE) is required and subsequently define a new construct: sustainable international business model innovations. In doing so, we introduce circular inputs, sharing platforms, product as a service, product use extension, and resource recovery as business models that contain the potential to reply to these grand challenges. Based on CE principles, the innovations and designs introduced are contrasted with the traditional linear economic model and are presented as actionable standardization/adaptation alternatives for companies responding to differing informal and formal international institutions. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based, dynamic capabilities, and international business model innovation perspectives, we introduce an integrative framework that is accompanied by a series of detailed research questions to provide future research opportunities for the domain. This conceptual approach holds that international resource design influences marketing capabilities adaptation which, in turn, impacts international performance and offers a foundation from which to build the literature.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Ces derni\`eres ann\'ees, les entreprises internationales ont d\^u faire face \`a des menaces majeures \`a l'\'echelle globale telles que des probl\`emes environnementaux, \'economiques et sociaux impr\'evus r\'esultant de la destruction \'ecologique, de la croissance d\'emographique et de l'activit\'e \'economique.                            Afin de r\'epondre \`a cette confluence cr\'eant une crise existentielle \'emergente, nous identifions qu'une \'economie circulaire (               Circular Economy               - CE) mondialis\'ee est n\'ecessaire, et d\'efinissons par la suite un nouveau concept : les innovations de mod\`ele \'economique international durable. Ce faisant, nous pr\'esentons les intrants circulaires, les plateformes de partage, le produit en tant que service, l'extension de l'utilisation du produit et la r\'ecup\'eration des ressources comme des mod\`eles \'economiques offrant le potentiel de r\'epondre \`a ces grands d\'efis. Bas\'ees sur les principes de la CE, les innovations et les conceptions introduites sont oppos\'ees au mod\`ele \'economique lin\'eaire traditionnel, et sont pr\'esent\'ees comme des alternatives de standardisation/adaptation actionnables pour les entreprises qui r\'epondent aux diff\'erentes institutions internationales informelles et formelles. Nous appuyant th\'eoriquement sur les perspectives fond\'ees sur les ressources, des capacit\'es dynamiques et de l'innovation de mod\`ele \'economique international, nous introduisons un cadre th\'eorique d'int\'egration accompagn\'e d'une s\'erie de questions de recherche d\'etaill\'ees afin d'offrir de futures possibilit\'es de recherche dans ce domaine. Cette approche conceptuelle soutient que la conception des ressources internationales influence l'adaptation des capacit\'es de marketing qui, \`a son tour, exerce un impact sur la performance internationale et offre une base sur laquelle se construit la litt\'erature.                        ,              Resumen             El imperativo global ha aumentado en los a\~nos recientes para que las empresas internacionales respondan a mayores amenazas como los problemas ambientales, sociales y econ\'omicos no intencionados, problemas que surgen de la destrucci\'on ecol\'ogica, crecimiento poblacional y actividad econ\'omica. Para responder a esta confluencia que, creado una crisis existencial emergente, identificamos que una econom\'ia circular (EC) globalizante se requiere y posteriormente definimos un nuevo constructo: innovaciones sostenibles en negocios internacionales. Al hacerlo, presentamos los insumos circulares, las plataformas para compartir, los productos como servicios, la extensi\'on del uso del producto, y la recuperaci\'on de recursos como modelos que contienen el potencial para responder a estos grandes retos. Con base en los principios de la econom\'ia circular, las innovaciones y dise\~nos presentados son contrastados con el modelo econ\'omico lineal tradicional y se presentan como alternativas de estandarizaci\'on y adaptaci\'on accionables para que las compa\~n\'ias respondan a diferentes instituciones formales e informales. Con base en los fundamentos te\'oricos de las capacidades din\'amicas y las perspectivas del modelo de innovaci\'on de negocios internacionales, presentamos un marco integrador que viene acompa\~nado de una serie de preguntas detalladas para proporcionar preguntas de investigaci\'on detalladas para este \'ambito. Esta aproximaci\'on conceptual sostiene que el dise\~no de recursos internacionales influye en la adaptaci\'on de las capacidades de marketing, la cual, a su vez, impacta el desempe\~no internacional y ofrecen una base sobre la cual construir la literatura.           ,              Resumo             O imperativo global tem aumentado nos \'ultimos anos para que empresas internacionais respondam a grandes amea\c{c}as, tais como problemas ambientais, sociais e econ\^omicos n\~ao intencionais decorrentes de estrago ecol\'ogico, crescimento populacional e atividade econ\^omica.

The audio processing within PlugSonic is based on the Web Audio API while the binaural rendering uses the 3D Tune-In Toolkit. Exploration of soundscapes in a physical space is made possible by adopting Apple's ARKit. The present paper describes the implementation details, the signal processing chain and the necessary steps to curate and experience a soundscape. We also include some metrics and performance details. The main goal of PlugSonic is to give users a complete set of tools, without the need for specific devices, external software and/or hardware specialised knowledge, or custom development, with the idea that spatial audio has the potential to become a readily accessible and easy to understand technology, for anyone to adopt, whether for creative or research purposes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Following asynchronous online discussion activities as a complex communication process is a demanding task for teachers. In this paper, the authors have explored the potential in supporting such activity through learning analytics. From the beginning, the authors acknowledged the limitations of technology to support the complexities of a pedagogical activity. Therefore, the methodology used was participatory design-based research (DBR) divided into two main stages. The first design phase dealt with the engagement of teachers and pedagogical experts in defining the data and metrics to be used to support the pedagogical concepts. The second consisted of an implementation phase including pilots with students and with crucial engagement of teachers in commenting their understanding over students' learning processes and the feedback the teachers could offer to them. Overall, the students shown improvements in their performance as monitored through the learning analytics group in contrast with control groups. The discussion over the design and its results could be potentially extrapolated to other educational contexts.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Medical errors still plague healthcare. Operating Room Black Box (ORBB) and ORBB-simulation (ORBBSIM) are innovative emerging technologies which continuously capture as well as categorize intraoperative data, team information, and audio-visual files, in effort to improve objective quality measures. ORBB and ORBBSIM have an opportunity to improve patient safety, yet a paucity of implementation literature exists. Overcoming implementation barriers is critical. This study sought to obtain rich insights while identifying facilitators and barriers to adoption of ORBB and ORBBSIM in alignment with Donabedian's model of health services and healthcare quality. Enrichment themes included translational performance improvement and real-world examples to develop sessions.                                         Methods               Interprofessional OR staff were invited to complete two surveys assessing staff's perceptions using TeamSTEPPS's validated Teamwork Perceptions Questionnaire (T-TPQ) and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative variables, and inductive phenomenological content analysis was used for qualitative.                                         Results               Survey 1 captured 71 responses from 334 invited (RR 21\%) while survey 2 captured 47 responses from 157 (RR 29.9\%). The T-TPQ score was 65.2, with Communication (70.4) the highest construct and Leadership (58.0) the lowest. Quality Improvement (QI), Patient Safety, and Objective Case Review were the most common perceived ORBB benefits. Trends suggested a reciprocal benefit of dual ORBB and ORBBSIM adoption. Trends also suggested that dual implementation can promote Psychological Safety, culture, trust, and technology comfort. The need for an implementation plan built on change management principles and a constructive culture were key findings.                                         Conclusions               Findings supported ORBB implementation themes from previous literature and deepened our understanding through the exploration of team culture. This blueprint provides a model to help organizations adopt ORBB and ORBBSIM. Outcomes can establish an empirical paradigm for future studies.},

Therefore, many entrepreneurs create online communities that allow self-selected stakeholders, such as customers, crowd investors, or enthusiasts, to interact with the venture and other like-minded individuals. However, research on how entrepreneurs can successfully engage community members and grow such online communities is only slowly emerging. In particular, it is unclear if, how much, and which content entrepreneurs should contribute to foster engagement in different types of communities and which role these community types play in the community's overall growth. Based on a longitudinal case study in the video game industry, we first theorize and show that\textemdash depending on the community type\textemdash both too much and too little entrepreneur-provided content fails to leverage community engagement potential and that different communities require more or less diverging content. We then theorize and show that community growth is largely driven by engagement in open communities, such as those hosted on social media. We outline the implications this has for entrepreneurs, our understanding of online communities, and entrepreneurial communities more generally.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, Open Innovation (OI) and crowdsourcing have been very popular topics in the innovation management literature, attracting significant interest and attention, and inspiring a rich production of publications. Although these two topics share common themes and address similar managerial challenges, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review that digs deep into the intersection of both fields. To fill in this gap a joint review of crowdsourcing and OI topics is both timely and of interest. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to carry out a comprehensive, systematic, and objective review of academic research to help shed light on the relationship between OI and crowdsourcing. For this purpose, we reviewed the literature published on these two topics between 2008 and 2019, applying two bibliometric techniques, co-citation and co-word analysis. We obtained the following results: (i) we provide a qualitative analysis of the emerging and trending themes, (ii) we discuss a characterization of the intersection between OI and crowdsourcing, identifying four dimensions (strategic, managerial, behavioral, and technological), (iii) we present a schematic reconceptualization of the thematic clusters, proposing an integrated view. We conclude by suggesting promising opportunities for future research.},

Indeed, experts believe that the next big digital transformation in how we live, communicate, work, trade and learn will be driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) [83]. This paper presents a high-level industrial and academic overview of AI in Education (AIEd). It presents the focus of latest research in AIEd on reducing teachers' workload, contextualized learning for students, revolutionizing assessments and developments in intelligent tutoring systems. It also discusses the ethical dimension of AIEd and the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the future of AIEd's research and practice. The intended readership of this article is policy makers and institutional leaders who are looking for an introductory state of play in AIEd.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The pharmacovigilance agreements (PVA) landscape has evolved over recent decades with rapid growth in the number and complexity of partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions between pharmaceutical companies. Simultaneously there has been increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Detailed regulations and guidance are lacking in this domain; hence companies have developed their own processes, templates, and tools, which have headed in different directions. Where feasible, marketing authorization holders (MAHs) have written contracts based on mutually understood requirements. Currently, MAHs are striving to find optimal solutions that safeguard patients, and in turn, support pharmacovigilance compliance. Through the TransCelerate BioPharma consortium MAHs are seeking simplification and efficiencies, to optimize the process of developing contractual agreements for pharmacovigilance. A survey of MAHs confirmed the perceptions above, and the need for efficient solutions to help navigate through the maze of complexity. The authors have led the development of tools and techniques to enable partnership between MAHs, and ultimately to support patient safety.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The concept of Society~5.0 and Industry 5.0 is not a simple chronological continuation or alternative to Industry 4.0 paradigm. Society 5.0 aims to place human beings at the midpoint of innovation, exploiting the impact of technology and Industry 4.0 results with the technological integration to improve quality of life, social responsibility and sustainability. This ground-breaking perspective has common points with the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. It also has major implication for universities transformations. Universities are called upon producing knowledge for new technologies and social innovation. In our paper, we argue that digitalisation opens new perspectives for universities and can become one of the main drivers of their change. Incorporating the assumptions of Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 into the universities practices and policies will allow both universities and societies to fully benefit from digital transformation. Making the human-oriented innovation as the universities trademark and developing new cooperative models will also help to achieve sustainable priorities. The use of the Quintuple Helix Model (QHM) might foster the process of necessary transformations capacities as it integrates different perspectives and sets the stage for sustainability priorities and considerations. As far as the practical goal is concerned, the paper proposes a set of recommendations for universities aiming at developing new forms and channels of distribution of education, research and innovation within in the context of QHM and Society 5.0. We call them socially and digitally engaged model.},

Methods               On September 17\textendash 18, 2021, SPINE20 held its annual meeting in Rome, Italy. Prior to the meeting, the SPINE20 created six proposed recommendations. These recommendations were uploaded to the SPINE20 website 10~days before the meeting and opened to the public for comments. The recommendations were discussed at the meeting allowing the participants to object and provide comments.                                         Results               In total, 27 societies endorsed the following recommendations. SPINE20 calls upon the G20 countries: (1) to expand telehealth for the access to spine care, especially in light of the current situation with COVID-19. (2) To adopt value-based interprofessional spine care as an approach to improve patient outcomes and reduce disability. (3) To facilitate access and invest in the development of a competent rehabilitation workforce to reduce the burden of disability related to spine disorders. (4) To adopt a strategy to promote daily physical activity and exercises among the elderly population to maintain an active and independent life with a healthy spine, particularly after COVID-19 pandemic. (5) To engage in capacity building with emerging countries and underserved communities for the benefit of spine patients. (6) To promote strategies to transfer evidence-based advances into patient benefit through effective implementation processes.                                         Conclusions               SPINE20's initiatives will make governments and decision makers aware of efforts to reduce needless suffering from disabling spine pain through education that can be instituted across the globe.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Finding leverage points for sustainability transformation of industrial and infrastructure systems is challenging, given that transformation is emergent from the complex interactions among socio-technical system elements over time within a specific social, technical and geographical context. Participatory multi-modelling, in which modellers and stakeholders collaborate to develop multiple interacting models to support a shared understanding of systems, is a promising approach to support sustainability transformations. The               participatory process               of modeling can serve as a leverage point by facilitating social learning amongst stakeholders, in which models can function as boundary objects that facilitate dialogue between stakeholders from different social worlds. We propose that participatory multi-modeling allows for the creation of               a boundary object ecology               , which involves a set of interacting and co-evolving boundary objects emerging throughout the modeling process. To explore this, we analyse the participatory multi-modelling process in the Windmaster project in the Rotterdam Port industrial cluster to understand which design choices were key to the creation of boundary objects. Our analysis shows that two types of design choices were key: design choices that enabled translations between participants, and those between participants and their organisation. We conclude that conceptualising participatory multi-modelling as a process of an evolving boundary object ecology, creating and adapting               multiple               interacting boundary objects provides a novel perspective that is useful for analysis and design of future participatory multi-modeling processes.},

This paper contributes to this effort by offering a philosophical, in particular Wittgensteinian framework for conceptualizing in what sense and how robots are related to culture and by exploring what it would mean to create an ``Ubuntu Robot''. In addition, the paper gestures towards a more culturally diverse and more relational approach to social robotics and emphasizes the role technology can play in addressing the challenges of modernity and in assisting cultural change: it argues that robots can help us to engage in cultural dialogue, reflect on our own culture, and change how we do things. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing literature on cross-cultural approaches to social robotics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process.                                         Methods               We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user's context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals.                                         Results               The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user's requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the ``Google Material Design'' guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users.                                         Conclusions               The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Context               Landscape science relies on foundational concepts of landscape ecology and seeks to understand the physical, biological, and human components of ecosystems to support land management decision-making. Incorporating landscape science into land management decisions, however, remains challenging. Many lands in the western United States are federally owned and managed for multiple uses, including recreation, conservation, and energy development.                                         Objective               We argue for stronger integration of landscape science into the management of these public lands.                                         Methods               We open by outlining the relevance of landscape science for public land planning, management, and environmental effects analysis, including pertinent laws and policies. We identify challenges to integrating landscape science into public land management, including the multijurisdictional nature and complicated spatial pattern of public lands, the capacity of agencies to identify and fill landscape science needs, and perceptions about the meaning of landscape approaches to management.                                         Results               We provide several recent examples related to landscape monitoring, restoration, reclamation, and conservation in which landscape science products were developed specifically to support decision-making.                                         Conclusions               We close by highlighting three actions\textemdash elevating the importance of science-management partnerships dedicated to coproducing actionable landscape science products, identifying where landscape science could foster efficiencies in the land-use planning process, and developing scenario-based landscape models for shrublands\textemdash that could improve landscape science support for public land planners and managers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The decolonial theory understands that Western Modernity keeps imposing itself through a triple mutually reinforcing and shaping imprisonment: coloniality of power, coloniality of knowledge, and coloniality of being. Technical design has an essential role in either maintaining or overcoming coloniality. In this article, two main approaches to decolonizing the technical design are presented. First is Yuk Hui's and Ahmed Ansari's proposals that, revisiting or recovering the different histories and philosophies of technology produced by humankind, intend to decolonize the minds of philosophers and engineers/architects/designers as a pre-condition for such decolonial designs to take place. I call them top-down approaches. Second is some technical design initiatives that, being developed alongside marginalized/subalternate people, intend to co-construct decolonial sociotechnical solutions through a committed, decolonizing, and careful dialog of knowledge. I call them bottom-up approaches. Once that is done, the article's second half derives ontological, epistemological, and political consequences from the conjugation of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Such consequences challenge some established or not yet entirely overcome understandings in the philosophy of technology (PT) and, in so doing, are meant to represent some steps in PT's decolonization. Even though both top-down and bottom-up approaches are considered, the article's main contributions are associated with (bottom-up) decolonial technical design practices, whose methodologies and outcomes are important study cases for PT and whose practitioners (i.e., decolonial designers) can be taken as inspiring examples for philosophers who want to decolonize/enlarge PT or make it decolonial (that is, a way of fostering decoloniality).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The recent proliferation of AI scandals led private and public organisations to implement new ethics guidelines, introduce AI ethics boards, and list ethical principles. Nevertheless, some of these efforts remained a fa\c{c}ade not backed by any substantive action. Such behaviour made the public question the legitimacy of the AI industry and prompted scholars to accuse the sector of ethicswashing, machinewashing, and ethics trivialisation\textemdash criticisms that spilt over to institutional AI ethics boards. To counter this widespread issue, contributions in the literature have proposed fixes that do not consider its systemic character and are based on a top-down, expert-centric governance. To fill this gap, we propose to make use of               qualified informed lotteries               : a two-step model that transposes the documented benefits of the ancient practice of sortition into the selection of AI ethics boards' members and combines them with the advantages of a stakeholder-driven, participative, and deliberative bottom-up process typical of Citizens' Assemblies. The model permits increasing the public's legitimacy and participation in the decision-making process and its deliverables, curbing the industry's over-influence and lobbying, and diminishing the instrumentalisation of ethics boards. We suggest that this sortition-based approach may provide a sound base for both public and private organisations in smart societies for constructing a decentralised, bottom-up, participative digital democracy.},

We further examine the role of networks in promoting innovation and international collaboration, highlighting practical experiences with a~case study of the Sustainable Finance Data Hub at the Deutsche Bundesbank. Finally, we discuss how these lessons can provide avenues to enhance data quality in central banks and official statistics and outline directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In a corporate sustainability context, scholars have been studying internal and external relations provided by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, mostly from the organizational perspective. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to map and analyze the literature on the impacts of integrating ESG criteria on corporate sustainability performance from different points of view. The methodology used followed the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, corroborated by a critical analysis. The results indicate that the integration of ESG criteria, observed from different perspectives, strengthens corporate sustainability performance. They also revealed narrowing gaps in the literature regarding methodological analysis. Most of the papers in the analyzed sample use company-level data and employ regression analysis in their analysis. The present study concludes that companies, regardless of nationality, follow the guidelines of ESG criteria integration and such procedure brings several benefits. It points to the lack of more confirmatory research approaches from a workers' perspective, as the interest remains in the economic-environmental realm from the organizations' point of view. The absence of such evidence points to a gap in the literature that suggests the need for new study initiatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Supporting the expansion of best practices in Biomedical Engineering (BME) can facilitate pathway toward the providing universal health coverage and more equitable and accessible healthcare technologies, especially in low- and middle-income (LMI) settings. These best practices can act as drivers of change and may involve scientific-technological issues, human intervention during technology development, educational aspects, social performance management for improved interactions along the medical technology life cycle, methods for managing resources and approaches for the establishment of regulatory frameworks.             The aim of our study was to identify weaknesses and strengths of the scientific, technological, socio-political, regulatory and educational landscape in BME in LMI resource settings. We thus analysed the current state-of-the-art through six dimensions considered fundamental for advancing quality and equity in healthcare: 1) relevant and 2) emergent technologies, 3) new paradigms in medical technology development, 4) innovative BME education, 5) regulation and standardization for novel approaches, and 6) policy making. In order to evaluate and compare their relevance, maturity and implementation challenges, they were assessed through a questionnaire to which 100 professionals from 35 countries with recognized experience in the field of BME and its application to LMI settings responded.             The results are presented and discussed, highlighting the main challenges and pinpointing relevant areas where intervention, including local lobbying and international promotion of best practices is necessary. We were also able to identify areas where minimal effort is required to make big changes in global health.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Immunization directly impacts health (SDG3) and brings a contribution to 14 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as ending poverty, reducing hunger, and reducing inequalities. Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this.                                         Methods               We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges.                                         Results               We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-\`a-vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030.                                         Conclusions               In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries' health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper focuses on addressing the urgent need for efficient and accurate automated screening tools for COVID-19 detection. Inspired by existing research efforts, we propose two framework models to tackle this challenge. The first model combines a conventional CNN architecture as a feature extractor with XGBoost as the classifier. The second model utilizes a classical CNN architecture with a Feedforward Neural Network for classification. The key distinction between the two models lies in their classification layers. Bayesian optimization techniques are employed to optimize the hyperparameters of both models, enabling a ``cheat-start'' to the training process with optimal configurations. To mitigate overfitting, transfer learning techniques such as Dropout and Batch normalization are incorporated. The CovidxCT-2A dataset is used for training, validation, and testing purposes. To establish a benchmark, we compare the performance of our models with state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature. Evaluation metrics including Precision, Recall, Specificity, Accuracy, and F1-score are employed to assess the efficacy of the models. The hybrid model demonstrates impressive results, achieving high precision (98.43\%), recall (98.41\%), specificity (99.26\%), accuracy (99.04\%), and F1-score (98.42\%). The standalone CNN model exhibits slightly lower but still commendable performance, with precision (98.25\%), recall (98.44\%), specificity (99.27\%), accuracy (98.97\%), and F1-score (98.34\%). Importantly, both models outperform five other state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy, as demonstrated by the results of this study.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, the European Union has made considerable efforts to develop dedicated strategies and policies for the governance of robotics and AI. An important component of the EU's approach is its emphasis on the need to mitigate the potential societal impacts of the expected rise in the interactive capacities of autonomous systems. In the quest to define and implement new policies addressing this issue, ethical notions have taken an increasingly central position. This paper presents a concise overview of the integration of this ethics narrative in the EU's policy plans. It demonstrates how the ethics narrative aids the definition of policy issues and the establishment of new policy ideas. Crucially, in this context, robotics and AI are explicitly understood as emerging technologies. This implies many ambiguities about their actual future impact, which in turn results in uncertainty regarding effective implementation of policies that draw on the ethics narrative. In an effort to develop clearer pathways towards the further development of ethical notions in AI and robotics governance, this paper understands human-robot interaction (HRI) research as a field that can play an important role in the implementation of ethics. Four different complementary pathways towards ethics integration in (HRI) research are proposed, namely: providing insights for the improvement of ethical assessment, further research into the moral competence of artificial agents, engage in value-based design and implementation of robots, and participation in discussions on building ethical sociotechnical systems around robots.},

It presents observations gathered in a collaborative robotics project that pursued an integrative ethics approach. The paper first contextualizes the increasing attention to ethical approaches in robotics development, design and implementation. Several existing considerations and attempts to further integrate ethics into the field of robotics are reviewed, while also providing context with respect to new trends that generate new possibilities for integrating ethical approaches into robotics and human-robot interaction research. Subsequently, the paper elaborates on the specificities of the collaborative robotics project that pursued an integrative approach. The collaborative robot is presented as a specific type of technological artifact, and insight is given into the project's aim to ``democratize'' this technology. Furthermore, practices required to integrate ethics are reviewed based on the author's observations and experiences in the project. Finally, to contribute to the further development of integrative approaches in robot ethics, these observations are developed into three constitutive components that should aid the further development of integrative robot ethics approaches, namely: increased attention for the way interdisciplinarity is defined in the field of robot ethics, the role and nature of ethical critique, and finally the chances integrative approaches offer for the development of more thorough anticipatory concepts.},

Despite sustainability advancements, urgent action remains necessary due to climate change and the high impact of the built environment. Regenerative Design represents a shift from current practices focused on reducing environmental impacts, as it aims to generate positive effects on both human and natural systems. Although digital design methods are commonly employed in sustainable design practice and research, there is presently no established framework to guide a digital regenerative design process. This study provides an analysis of existing literature on regenerative design and digital design methods and presents a framework based on building information modelling (BIM) methodology and computational design methods, that can be applied to both urban and building design. This framework identifies digital tools and organizes indicators based on the pillars of climate, people, and nature for regenerative design, drawing upon a comprehensive analysis of literature, including standards, sustainability frameworks and research studies. The framework is illustrated through a case study evaluation. The paper also highlights the potential and limitations of digital methods concerning regenerative design and suggests possibilities for future expansion by incorporating additional quantifiable indicators that reflect research developments, to achieve positive outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this article, we highlight current research directions in the Technikpsychologie research area, using the example of the interdisciplinary research work of FAI (Work and Engineering Psychology Research Group at the Technical University of Darmstadt) and the articles included in this special issue. To this end, we relate the articles in this special issue from the research areas of road traffic planning (Hupfer et al.), usable IT security and privacy solutions (Renaud), social aspects of technically mediated communication (Diefenbach), human-centered interface design (Mucha et~al.), aviation safety (Santel), human-centered design of autonomous vehicles (Lindner \& Stoll), and perceptual psychology-oriented product design (Zandi \& Khanh) to current research projects at FAI.                            Practical Relevance                          Technical products only offer added value by efficiently supporting users in achieving their goals if they have been developed appropriately for the context of use and the individual characteristics of the users. The human-centered design of\textemdash especially technical\textemdash products reflects this through an iterative and participatory development process. In this article, we describe nine examples of such human-centered design of technology products. The research results and the methods presented provide insights for developers and decision-makers in the fields of transportation, IT, vehicle development and general product design.           ,              Zusammenfassung             In diesem Artikel zeigen wir aktuelle Forschungsrichtungen der Technikpsychologie am Beispiel der interdisziplin\"ar gepr\"agten Forschungsarbeit der FAI (Forschungsgruppe f\"ur Arbeits- und Ingenieurpsychologie an der Technischen Universit\"at Darmstadt) und den in diesem Themenheft enthaltenen Artikeln auf. Zu diesem Zweck setzen wir die Artikel dieses Themenheftes aus den Forschungsbereichen Verkehrsplanung (Hupfer et al.), nutzbare IT Sicherheit- und Privatsph\"arel\"osungen (Renaud), soziale Aspekte der technisch mediierten Kommunikation (Diefenbach), menschzentrierte Schnittstellengestaltung (Mucha et~al.), Flugsicherheit (Santel), menschzentrierte Gestaltung von autonomen Fahrzeugen (Lindner \& Stoll) sowie wahrnehmungspsychologisch orientierte Produktgestaltung (Zandi \& Khanh) zu aktuellen Forschungsprojekten der FAI in Verbindung.                            Praktische Relevanz                          Technische Produkte bieten nur dann einen Mehrwert, wenn sie Nutzende effizient in der Erreichung ihrer Ziele unterst\"utzen, wenn diese passend f\"ur den Nutzungskontext und die individuellen Charakteristiken der Nutzenden entwickelt wurden. Die menschzentrierte Gestaltung von \textendash ~insbesondere technischen~\textendash{} Produkten bildet dies durch den iterativ und partizipativ gepr\"agten Entwicklungsprozess ab. In diesem Artikel beschreiben wir insgesamt neun Beispiele f\"ur eine solche menschzentrierte Gestaltung von Technikprodukten. Die Forschungsergebnisse ebenso wie die vorgestellten Methoden liefern hierbei Erkenntnisse f\"ur Entwickler:innen und Entscheider:innen aus den Bereichen Verkehr, IT, Fahrzeugentwicklung sowie genereller Produktgestaltung.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Requirements engineering (RE) has established itself as a core software engineering discipline. It is well acknowledged that good RE leads to higher quality software and considerably reduces the risk of failure or budget-overspending of software development projects. It is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. To this date, there exists no central concept of what RE education shall comprise. To lay a foundation, we report on a systematic literature review of the field and provide a systematic map describing the current state of RE education. Doing so allows us to describe how the educational landscape has changed over the last decade. Results show that only a few established author collaborations exist and that RE education research is predominantly published in venues other than the top RE research venues (i.e., in venues other than the RE conference and journal). Key trends in RE instruction of the past decade include involvement of real or realistic stakeholders, teaching predominantly elicitation as an RE activity, and increasing student factors such as motivation or communication skills. Finally, we discuss open opportunities in RE education, such as training for security requirements and supply chain risk management, as well as developing a pedagogical foundation grounded in evidence of effective instructional approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Fashion firms have transferred their manufacturing processes to Asia, seeking minimum labor costs, supported by the academic literature's proposals for alternative supply chain configurations to maximize profits. Fashion industry has undergone public analysis, facing demands for greater transparency about environmental and social sustainability. The growing public awareness of sustainability issues has led firms to declare their commitment to sustainable resources, but few changes have been registered. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe listed technological innovation as a key tool for making the fashion industry transparent and traceable regarding sustainability and circularity. The research and responsible innovation framework indicate appropriate ways to manage innovation from a responsible and ethical perspective, according to ethical corporate behaviour (ECB), particularly in the industries characterized by productive phases processed in more countries, such as the fashion industry. However, the linkages between responsible innovation, ECB towards innovative and sustainable business models, and their conceptualization, are still unclear in the fashion industry, achieving the goals included in the UN 2030 Agenda. This study draws on bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on 114 articles published between 1990 and 2021 allows to identify the above issues in the research domains, and outline the evolutionary trajectories, as well as to explore the literary corpus about responsible innovation (RI) in the ethical corporate behaviour (ECB) of the fashion industry and its Asian suppliers. The results highlight that fashion brands strive to develop RI and ECB along their supply chain. Still, the misalignment of corporate ethics and cultural values represents a significant obstacle to the adoption of business models, especially to achieve the goals of UN 2030 Agenda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that discusses RI as enabling driver in the ECB for fashion companies also defining a future research agenda including RI, ECB, iSBMs towards SDGs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Profit-oriented service sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and entertainment are increasingly looking at how professional service robots can be integrated into the workplace to perform socio-cognitive tasks that were previously reserved for humans. This is a work in which social and labor sciences recognize the principle role of emotions. However, the models and narratives of emotions that drive research, design, and deployment of service robots in human\textendash robot interaction differ considerably from how emotions are framed in the sociology of labor and feminist studies of service work. In this paper, we explore these tensions through the concepts of affective and emotional labor, and outline key insights these concepts offer for the design and evaluation of professional service robots. Taken together, an emphasis on interactionist approaches to emotions and on the demands of affective labor, leads us to argue that service employees are under-represented in existing studies in human\textendash robot interaction. To address this, we outline how participatory design and value-sensitive design approaches can be applied as complimentary methodological frameworks that include service employees as vital stakeholders.},

To date, discussions about machine learning in this context have focused on problems that can be measured and assessed quantitatively, such as by estimating the extent of potential harm or calculating incurred risks. We maintain that such discussions neglect the qualitative moral impact of these technologies. Drawing on the philosophical approaches of technomoral change and technological mediation theory, which explore the interplay between technologies and morality, we present an analysis of concerns related to the adoption of machine learning-aided medical diagnosis. We analyze anticipated moral issues that machine learning systems pose for different stakeholders, such as bias and opacity in the way that models are trained to produce diagnoses, changes to how health~care providers, patients, and developers understand their roles and professions, and challenges to existing forms of medical legislation. Albeit preliminary in nature, the insights offered by the technomoral change and the technological mediation approaches expand and enrich the current discussion about machine learning in diagnostic practices, bringing distinct and currently underexplored areas of concern to the forefront. These insights can contribute to a more encompassing and better informed decision-making process when adapting machine learning techniques to medical diagnosis, while acknowledging the interests of multiple stakeholders and the active role that technologies play in generating, perpetuating, and modifying ethical concerns in health care.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Today's Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) approaches automatically generate Web applications from conceptual, domain-specific models. This enhances productivity by simplifying the design process through a higher degree of abstraction. Due to this raised level of abstraction, the collaboration on conceptual models also opens up new use cases, such as the tighter involvement of non-technical stakeholders into Web development. However, especially in the early design stages of Web applications, common practices for requirement elicitation mostly rely on wireframes instead of MDWE, created usually in analog settings. Additionally, state-of-the-art MDWE should integrate established and emerging Web development features, such as Near Real-Time (NRT) collaborative modeling and shared editing on the generated code. The combination of collaborative modeling, coding and wireframing, all in NRT, bears a lot of potential for improving MDWE practices. The challenge when covering these requirements lies with synchronizing source code, wireframes and models, an essential need to cope with regular changes in the software architecture to provide the flexibility needed for agile MDWE. In this contribution, we present a MDWE approach with live code editing and wireframing capabilities. We present the conceptual considerations of our approach, the realization of it and the integration into an overarching development methodology. Following a design science approach, we present the cyclic iterations of developing and evaluating our artifacts, which show promising results for collaborative Web development tasks that could open the gate towards novel, collaborative and agile MDWE techniques.},

Free-form pottery modeling can be efficiently geometrically modeled with the right tools with detailed 3D print outputs, yet challenging to be manufactured using traditional art. The new advanced pottery VR simulation is a promising method to recreate the traditional pottery simulation for a better experience with some barriers. The challenges that arise from surface detail in pottery are a tedious task accomplished by mesh blending and retopology. This paper focuses on refining the VP application's performance by adding unique sound resonance as a more likely infinite geometric phenomenon textures, blending it into the basic shapes. This paper combines creativity and visual computing technologies such as VR, mesh blending, fixing errors, and 3D printing to bring the ceramic artist's imagination to life. We have used sound resonance with virtual pottery (VP) systems refinements to demonstrate several standard pottery methods from free form deformed pottery, retopology, mesh blended for surface details, and 3D printed pottery with materials including polymer and ceramic resins.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A variety of approaches have appeared in academic literature and in design practice representing ``ethics-first'' methods. These approaches typically focus on clarifying the normative dimensions of design, or outlining strategies for explicitly incorporating values into design. While this body of literature has developed considerably over the last 20~years, two themes central to the endeavour of ethics and values in design (E\,+\,VID) have yet to be systematically discussed in relation to each other: (a) designer agency, and (b) the strength of normative claims informing the design process. To address this gap, we undertook a structured review of leading E\,+\,VID approaches and critiques, and classified them according to their positions on normative strength, and views regarding designer agency. We identified 18 distinct approaches and 13 critiques that met the inclusion criteria for our review. Included papers were distributed across the spectrum of views regarding normative strength, and we found that no approaches and only one critique represented a view characteristic of ``low'' designer agency. We suggest that the absence of ``low'' designer agency approaches results in the neglect of crucial influences on design as targets of intervention by designers. We conclude with suggestions for future research that might illuminate strategies to achieve ethical design in information mature societies, and argue that without attending to the tensions raised by balancing normatively ``strong'' visions of the future with limitations imposed on designer agency in corporate-driven design settings, ``meaningful'' ethical design will continue to encounter challenges in practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Intelligent assistants are an increasingly commonplace class of information systems spanning a broad range of form and complexity. But what characterizes an intelligent assistant, and how do we design better assistants? In the paper, the authors contribute to scientific research in the domain of intelligent assistants in three steps, each building on the previous. First, they investigate the historical context of assistance as human work. By examining qualitative studies regarding the work of human assistants, the authors inductively derive concepts crucial to modeling the context of assistance. This analysis informs the second step, in which they develop a conceptual typology of intelligent assistants using 111 published articles. This typology explicates the characteristics (what or how) of intelligent assistants and their use context (who or which). In the third and final step, the authors utilize this typology to shed light on historical trends and patterns in design and evaluation of intelligent assistants, reflect on missed opportunities, and discuss avenues for further exploration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The concept of a circular economy is at a crossroads. To date, it has been largely driven by top-down national or trans-national legislation such as EU Circular Economy Package or Chinese Circular Economy Promotion. Bottom-up or grassroots engagement has been minimal and innovation has been largely restricted to use of 3R or 4R frameworks to reduce, reuse, recycle materials and products or recover waste as energy. Greater implementation of a circular economy needs a paradigm shift in public attitudes coupled with greater innovation that moves from 3R to 9R framework. Building on the insights gained from the successful transition of two Scandinavian cities of V\"axj\"o and S\o nderborg to becoming fossil fuel-free economies, the article explores use of natural language processing tools to create shared narratives and stories from large format public engagement that expresses common interests, values and priorities that in turn can contribute to a participatory design of a circular economy. The article uses published data from Christchurch `Share an Idea' as a case study.},

While affordable and effective VR and AR headsets are now available, neither technology has achieved widespread user adoption. However, we predict continual technological advances and cost reductions are likely to lead to wider diffusion in society. Bridging the chasm from the early adopters to the early majority will require careful consideration of the needs of a more casual and diverse user population. In particular, it is desirable to minimise the exclusion of potential users based on their unique needs and maximise the inclusion of users in these novel immersive experiences. Ensuring equitable access to the emerging metaverse further reinforces the need to consider the diverse needs of users. We refer to this objective of maximising the accessibility and enjoyment potential of users of VR, AR and the metaverse as               Inclusive Immersion               . This paper reviews the research and commercial landscape seeking to address the accessibility needs of users in VR and AR. The survey provides the basis for a synthesis of the emerging strategies for maximising the inclusiveness of VR and AR applications. Finally, we identify several unaddressed accessibility challenges requiring further research attention. Our paper consolidates disparate efforts related to promoting accessible VR and AR and delivers directions for advancing research in this area.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Participatory modeling (PM) is a craft that is often learned by training `on the job' and mastered through years of practice. There is little explicit knowledge available on identifying and documenting the skills needed to perform PM. In the modeling literature, existing attempts to identify relevant competencies have focused on the specific technical skills required for specific technical model development. The other skills required to organize and conduct the stakeholder process seem to be more vaguely and poorly defined in this context. The situation is complicated by PM being an essentially transdisciplinary craft, with no single discipline or skill set to borrow ideas and recommendations from. In this paper, we aim to set the foundation for both the practice and capacity-building efforts for PM by identifying the relevant core competencies. Our inquiry into this topic starts with reviewing and compiling literature on competencies in problem-solving research areas related to PM (e.g., systems thinking, facilitated model building, operations research, and so forth). We augment our inquiry with results from a PM practitioners' survey to learn how~they perceive the importance of different competencies and how the scope of these competencies may vary across the various roles that participatory modellers play. As a result, we identified five core competency areas essential for PM: systems thinking, modeling, group facilitation, project management and leadership, and, more recently, designing and running virtual workshops and events.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Integrated utilisation of digital health data has the power to transform healthcare to deliver more efficient and effective services, and the learning health system (LHS) is emerging as a model to achieve this. The LHS uses routine data from service delivery and patient care to generate knowledge to continuously improve healthcare. The aim of this project was to explore key features of a successful and sustainable LHS to inform implementation in an Academic Health Science Centre context.                                         Methods               We purposively identified and conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with leaders, experienced in supporting or developing data driven innovations in healthcare. A thematic analysis using NVivo was undertaken.                                         Results               Analysis of 26 interviews revealed five themes thought to be integral in an effective, sustainable LHS: (1) Systematic approaches and iterative, continuous learning with implementation into healthcare contributing to new best-practice care; (2) Broad stakeholder, clinician and academic engagement, with collective vision, leadership, governance and a culture of trust, transparency and co-design; (3) Skilled workforce, capability and capacity building; (4) Resources with sustained investment over time and; (5) Data access, systems and processes being integral to a sustainable LHS.                                         Conclusions               This qualitative study provides insights into the elements of a sustainable LHS across a range of leaders in data-driven healthcare improvement. Fundamentally, an LHS requires continuous learning with implementation of new evidence back into frontline care to improve outcomes. Structure, governance, trust, culture, vision and leadership were all seen as important along with a skilled workforce and sustained investment. Processes and systems to optimise access to quality data were also seen as vital in an effective, sustainable LHS. These findings will inform a co-designed framework for implementing a sustainable LHS within the Australian healthcare and Academic Health Science Centre context. It is anticipated that application of these findings will assist to embed and accelerate the use of routine health data to continuously generate new knowledge and ongoing improvement in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The opioid epidemic has enabled rapid and unsurpassed use of big data on people with opioid use disorder to design initiatives to battle the public health crisis, generally without adequate input from impacted communities. Efforts informed by big data are saving lives, yielding significant benefits. Uses of big data may also undermine public trust in government and cause other unintended harms.                                         Objectives               We aimed to identify concerns and recommendations regarding how to use big data on opioid use in ethical ways.                                         Methods               We conducted focus groups and interviews in 2019 with 39 big data stakeholders (gatekeepers, researchers, patient advocates) who had interest in or knowledge of the Public Health Data Warehouse maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.                                         Results               Concerns regarding big data on opioid use are rooted in potential privacy infringements due to linkage of previously distinct data systems, increased profiling and surveillance capabilities, limitless lifespan, and lack of explicit informed consent. Also problematic is the inability of affected groups to control how big data are used, the potential of big data to increase stigmatization and discrimination of those affected despite data anonymization, and uses that ignore or perpetuate biases. Participants support big data processes that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions. Recommendations for ethical big data governance offer ways to narrow the big data divide (e.g., prioritize health equity, set off-limits topics/methods, recognize blind spots), enact shared data governance (e.g., establish community advisory boards), cultivate public trust and earn social license for big data uses (e.g., institute safeguards and other stewardship responsibilities, engage the public, communicate the greater good), and refocus ethical approaches.                                         Conclusions               Using big data to address the opioid epidemic poses ethical concerns which, if unaddressed, may undermine its benefits. Findings can inform guidelines on how to conduct ethical big data governance and in ways that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the issue of wastewater due to oil spills and pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, which has led to significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences for local communities. The study employed a secondary data collection approach, drawing on various sources, including published research articles, reports, official records, and satellite imagery.                                         Main body of the abstract               Through a systematic review and synthesis of the available literature, the paper identified key challenges, mitigation and remediation strategies, policy recommendations, and areas for future research. The findings of this study revealed that the existing regulatory framework has not been fully effective in preventing and addressing oil spills and pollution in the Niger Delta region due to factors such as weak enforcement, inadequate resources, and overlapping responsibilities among regulatory agencies. Moreover, existing measures for oil spill response, clean-up, compensation, and remediation have had limited success, leaving affected communities to continue suffering from the impacts of oil spills and pollution.                                         Short conclusion               The paper highlights the potential of innovative approaches and technologies, such as advanced oil spill detection and monitoring technologies, bioremediation, and renewable energy, to enhance the effectiveness of mitigation and remediation efforts. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of collaboration and cooperation among various stakeholders, including government agencies, oil companies, local communities, civil society organizations, and international partners, in addressing the challenges posed by oil spills and pollution in the Niger Delta region. Based on the findings, the paper presents several policy recommendations, such as strengthening the regulatory framework, enhancing transparency and accountability, promoting community participation and empowerment, and encouraging investment in sustainable development and clean technologies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the digital era, we witness the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems, while improving productivity and efficiency. Yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the ``black box''. Central to understanding the ``black box'' is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action; it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms. But an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society. If we permit AI to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? We find that over 160 ethical AI principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms. This maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide. We need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and AI governance. The paper seeks to harmonise and align approaches, illustrating the opportunities and threats of AI, while raising awareness of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) as a potential collaborative mechanism to demystify governance complexity and to establish an equitable digital society.},

The rise in digital wearables for remote healthcare is evolving at an increasing pace towards patient-centred and personalised care with connected patients. This transformation is creating new opportunities for designers to increase patients' participation and sustain their engagement in remote healthcare. In this paper, the authors have investigated the role of gender in aesthetic design in the context of digital health wearables to enhance user engagement and interaction. The investigations were conducted through participatory design sessions and showed a constructive relationship between aesthetic preferences and understanding the influence of gender as a means of facilitating user engagement with digital health wearables. This paper presents a novel user response model that leads to suggestions for future work, including research in the areas of gender awareness in aesthetics to move beyond traditional, stereotypical, and pre-identified gendered characteristics related to femininity and masculinity. The findings conclude with a path forwards for design research to promote gender awareness in aesthetic design~for the realisation of healthcare wearables of the future               .},

No nation is on track to achieve the UN sustainable development goals for 2030. The traditional innovation ecosystem is insufficient. Rather than only solving problems, technological innovation is creating new challenges that society is struggling with. Innovation needs to be developed differently to focus on impact.                            Geneva Macro Labs initiated a~new approach to foster sustainable innovation which was based on a~combination of systems theory, collective intelligence, agile development and design thinking. The initiative, called               Geneva impACTs,               brought together a~diverse group of experts, start-ups and investors to develop innovative projects, aiming to make inroads towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. It started at a~time when COVID-19 measures made it impossible for groups to meet in person and so the entire process was conducted virtually using a~range of online tools.                          A~critical reflection shows the methodological strengths of the Geneva impACTs approach and identifies suggestions for improvement to be considered for future iterations. As an overall result, this new methodology is highly conducive to impact innovation.           ,              Zusammenfassung             Dieser Beitrag der Zeitschrift Gruppe. Interaktion. Organisation. (GIO) stellt anhand einer Fallstudie einen Ansatz zum Design nachhaltiger Innovation vor. Die Ziele der Vereinten Nationen f\"ur nachhaltige Entwicklung bis 2030 zu erreichen, scheint keiner Nation zu gelingen. Die bestehenden Innovationsmechanismen haben sich als unzureichend herausgestellt. Statt blo\ss{} Probleme zu l\"osen, schafft Innovation zus\"atzliche Herausforderungen, mit denen die Gesellschaft zu k\"ampfen hat. Daher muss Innovation darauf fokussiert werden, die Nachhaltigkeitsziele zu f\"ordern.                            Geneva Macro Labs initiierte und verfolgte einen neuen Ansatz zur F\"orderung nachhaltiger Innovation, der auf einer Kombination aus Systems Theory, kollektiver Intelligenz, agiler Entwicklung und Design Thinking basiert. Die Initiative               Geneva impACTs               brachte eine Vielzahl von Experten, Start-ups und Investoren zusammen, um innovative Projekte zu entwickeln, die einen Beitrag zum Erreichen der Ziele f\"ur nachhaltige Entwicklung 2030 leisten sollen. Als die Initiative ins Leben gerufen wurde, machten COVID-19-Ma\ss nahmen es den Beteiligten unm\"oglich, sich pers\"onlich zu treffen und zwang sie dazu, komplett via Online-Tools zu interagieren.                          Eine kritische Reflexion zeigt die methodischen St\"arken dieses Ansatzes und identifiziert Verbesserungsvorschl\"age, die bei k\"unftiger Anwendung ber\"ucksichtigt werden sollten. Im Ergebnis k\"onnen Innovationen, die Nachhaltigkeit zum Ziel haben, sehr von dieser neuen Methodik profitieren.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Small unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) are replacing or supplementing occupied aircraft and ground-based surveys in animal monitoring due to improved sensors, efficiency, costs, and logistical benefits. Numerous UAS and sensors are available and have been used in various methods. However, justification for selection or methods used are not typically offered in published literature. Furthermore, existing reviews do not adequately cover past and current UAS applications for animal monitoring, nor their associated UAS/sensor characteristics and environmental considerations. We present a systematic map that collects and consolidates evidence pertaining to UAS monitoring of animals.                                         Methods               We investigated the current state of knowledge on UAS applications in terrestrial animal monitoring by using an accurate, comprehensive, and repeatable systematic map approach. We searched relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as dissertations and theses, using online publication databases, Google Scholar, and by request through a professional network of collaborators and publicly available websites. We used a tiered approach to article exclusion with eligible studies being those that monitor (i.e., identify, count, estimate, etc.) terrestrial vertebrate animals. Extracted metadata concerning UAS, sensors, animals, methodology, and results were recorded in Microsoft Access. We queried and catalogued evidence in the final database to produce tables, figures, and geographic maps to accompany this full narrative review, answering our primary and secondary questions.                                         Review findings               We found 5539 articles from our literature searches of which 216 were included with extracted metadata categories in our database and narrative review. Studies exhibited exponential growth over time but have levelled off between 2019 and 2021 and were primarily conducted in North America, Australia, and Antarctica. Each metadata category had major clusters and gaps, which are described in the narrative review.                                         Conclusions               Our systematic map provides a useful synthesis of current applications of UAS-animal related studies and identifies major knowledge clusters (well-represented subtopics that are amenable to full synthesis by a systematic review) and gaps (unreported or underrepresented topics that warrant additional primary research) that guide future research directions and UAS applications. The literature for the use of UAS to conduct animal surveys has expanded intensely since its inception in 2006 but is still in its infancy. Since 2015, technological improvements and subsequent cost reductions facilitated widespread research, often to validate UAS technology to survey single species with application of descriptive statistics over limited spatial and temporal scales. Studies since the 2015 expansion have still generally focused on large birds or mammals in open landscapes of 4 countries, but regulations, such as maximum altitude and line-of-sight limitations, remain barriers to improved animal surveys with UAS. Critical knowledge gaps include the lack of (1) best practices for using UAS to conduct standardized surveys in general, (2) best practices to survey whole wildlife communities in delineated areas, and (3) data on factors affecting bias in counting animals from UAS images. Promising advances include the use of thermal sensors in forested environments or nocturnal surveys and the development of automated or semi-automated machine-learning algorithms to accurately detect, identify, and count animals from UAS images.},

Transformations towards sustainable food systems are essential to achieve the United Nations' 2030 Agenda and the need for more sustainable food systems has been recognised in the               European Green Deal               and its               Farm to Fork Strategy               . The Swedish ambition to act as a ~global~leader in achieving the 2030 Agenda and the European Commission's aspiration for Europe to lead global food system transformations offer a critical opportunity to study transformational processes and agents of change in a high-income region with externalised environmental and sustainability impacts. Drawing on theories of complex systems transformations, this study identifies features of food system transformations, exploring places to intervene and examines the roles, responsibilities, and agency related to these changes. The results of this study provide three main conclusions highlighting (i) alignment of high-level policy and the perspectives of national practitioners at the paradigm level, especially concerning how food is valued, which is a crucial first step for transformational processes to come about (ii) a lack of clarity as well as diversity of pathways to transform food systems although common objectives are expressed, and (iii) governance mechanisms as enablers for a diversity of transformations. Moreover, these processes must acknowledge the contextual and complex nature of food systems and the level of agency and power of actors.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digitalisation affects management control (MC). It leads to changes in the way MC activities are organised, performed and analysed. Companies of all industries, locations and sizes have to adapt their MC to digital circumstances, starting with the understanding and delimitation of MC tasks, through the modified application of MC instruments and the consideration of behavioural aspects of MC, to the organisation of the MC function within the company. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature according to Tranfield et al. (Br J Manag 14:207\textendash 222, 2003), focusing on the impact of digitalisation on MC. A comprehensive overview of scientific literature is provided by reviewing 166 highly rated accounting journals (based on multiple international journal ratings) and analysing 116 articles from January 2000 to August 2022. Based on the MC framework developed by Guenther (J Manag Control 23:269\textendash 290, 2013), the identified studies are categorised into the following research dimensions: tasks, instruments, organisation and behavioural aspects. Multiple studies highlight the continuous development of the MC function under the impact of digitalisation, including the extension of MC tasks, the adaptation of existing MC instruments and creation of new MC instruments, positive and negative behavioural aspects of digitalisation on MC and the establishment of new MC organisation models. In addition to the qualitative content analysis, this literature review also includes an analysis of the methods applied and illustrates their changes over time. This study reveals research gaps in relation to the current MC research and presents potential starting points for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The growing global burden of mental illness has prompted calls for innovative research strategies. Theoretical models of mental health include complex contributions of biological, psychosocial, experiential, and other environmental influences. Accordingly, neuropsychiatric research has self-organized into largely isolated disciplines working to decode each individual contribution. However, research directly modeling objective biological measurements in combination with cognitive, psychological, demographic, or other environmental measurements is only now beginning to proliferate. This review aims to (1) to describe the landscape of modern mental health research and current movement towards integrative study, (2) to provide a concrete framework for quantitative integrative research, which we call Whole Person Modeling, (3) to explore existing and emerging techniques and methods used in Whole Person Modeling, and (4) to discuss our observations about the scarcity, potential value, and untested aspects of highly transdisciplinary research in general. Whole Person Modeling studies have the potential to provide a better understanding of multilevel phenomena, deliver more accurate diagnostic and prognostic tests to aid in clinical decision making, and test long standing theoretical models of mental illness. Some current barriers to progress include challenges with interdisciplinary communication and collaboration, systemic cultural barriers to transdisciplinary career paths, technical challenges in model specification, bias, and data harmonization, and gaps in transdisciplinary educational programs. We hope to ease anxiety in the field surrounding the often mysterious and intimidating world of transdisciplinary, data-driven mental health research and provide a useful orientation for students or highly specialized researchers who are new to this area.},

The exploration of Self as a data source allowed both researchers (in their teaching role) to reflect on core areas of faculty development in connection with the specific co-teaching style they adopted. Autoethnography allowed all the involved actors (students and professors) to visualize a transformative direction in their academic identity and professional growth. The discussion of the results is based on a content analysis of different data sources where all the data were triangulated in a double connotation, that is, between professors and among the different sources in an iterative process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Interest in home-based stroke rehabilitation mechatronics, which includes both robots and sensor mechanisms, has increased over the past 12 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the existing lack of access to rehabilitation for stroke survivors post-discharge. Home-based stroke rehabilitation devices could improve access to rehabilitation for stroke survivors, but the home environment presents unique challenges compared to clinics. The present study undertakes a scoping review of designs for at-home upper limb stroke rehabilitation mechatronic devices to identify important design principles and areas for improvement. Online databases were used to identify papers published 2010\textendash 2021 describing novel rehabilitation device designs, from which 59 publications were selected describing 38 unique designs. The devices were categorized and listed according to their target anatomy, possible therapy tasks, structure, and features. Twenty-two devices targeted proximal (shoulder and elbow) anatomy, 13 targeted distal (wrist and hand) anatomy, and three targeted the whole arm and hand. Devices with a greater number of actuators in the design were more expensive, with a small number of devices using a mix of actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom to target more complex anatomy while reducing the cost. Twenty-six of the device designs did not specify their target users' function or impairment, nor did they specify a target therapy activity, task, or exercise. Twenty-three of the devices were capable of reaching tasks, 6 of which included grasping capabilities. Compliant structures were the most common approach of including safety features in the design. Only three devices were designed to detect compensation, or undesirable posture, during therapy activities. Six of the 38 device designs mention consulting stakeholders during the design process, only two of which consulted patients specifically. Without stakeholder involvement, these designs risk being disconnected from user needs and rehabilitation best practices. Devices that combine actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom allow a greater variety and complexity of tasks while not significantly increasing their cost. Future home-based upper limb stroke rehabilitation mechatronic designs should provide information on patient posture during task execution, design with specific patient capabilities and needs in mind, and clearly link the features of the design to users' needs.},

Diagnoses are visually performed by dermatologists, by naked-eye observation. This paper proposes an augmented reality smartphone application for supporting the dermatologist in the real-time analysis of a skin lesion. The app augments the camera view with information related to the lesion features generally measured by the dermatologist for formulating the diagnosis. The lesion is also classified by a deep learning approach for identifying melanoma. The real-time process adopted for generating the augmented content is described. The real-time performances are also evaluated and a user study is also conducted. Results revealed that the real-time process may be entirely executed on the Smartphone and that the support provided is well judged by the target users.},

A grand challenge is a substantial problem, opportunity, or question that motives sustained research and design activity. The eight grand challenges are: (1) Accounting for Power, (2) Evaluating Value Sensitive Design, (3) Framing and Prioritizing Values, (4) Professional and Industry Appropriation, (5) Tech policy, (6) Values and Human Emotions, (7) Value Sensitive Design and Intelligent Algorithms, and (8) Value Tensions. Each grand challenge consists of a discussion of its importance and a set of tractable key questions.},

We argue that Brazil has a long history of policies for digital development, covering a range of policies that encourage research and development and deploy AI-based digital technologies in industry and governments. Specifically for the AI policy, we analyze how these policies are fragmented into different initiatives without an approach to integrating the instruments and their mixes. We analyze how and why the Brazilian National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence design fails to implement and create an integrated perspective of these policies. This perspective for AI policy in Brazil results in fragmentation and failures to involve actors in the formulation and implementation process. The article concludes that the Brazilian perspective for artificial intelligence, emerging with EBIA, reproduces a situation of path dependence without promoting significant policy changes for the development and application of this technology in society.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The European Union is working towards harmonizing legislation across Europe, in order to improve cross-border interchange of legal information. This goal is supported for instance via standards such as the European Law Identifier (ELI) and the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI), which provide technical specifications for Web identifiers and suggestions for vocabularies to be used to describe metadata pertaining to legal documents in a machine readable format. Notably, these ECLI and ELI metadata standards adhere to the RDF data format which forms the basis of Linked Data, and therefore have the potential to form a basis for a pan-European legal Knowledge Graph. Unfortunately, to date said specifications have only been partially adopted by EU member states. In this paper we describe a methodology to transform the existing legal information system used in Austria to such a legal knowledge graph covering different steps from modeling national specific aspects, to population, and finally the integration of legal data from other countries through linked data. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by exemplifying practical use cases from legal information search, which are not possible in an automated fashion so far.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study comprehensively reviews the relationship between green finance and sustainable development, specifically focusing on combatting climate change and achieving carbon neutrality. Utilizing a narrative review methodology, the study examines a range of scholarly articles and publications to identify key themes, findings, and future directions in green finance. The review emphasizes the crucial role of substantial investments in green and low-carbon initiatives to address climate change effectively and promote sustainable economic growth. It highlights the necessity of robust regulatory frameworks that facilitate the availability of green finance and the integration of carbon\textendash neutral practices. Additionally, the paper explores the potential of impact investing, wherein investors accept lower financial returns in exchange for non-financial benefits in green finance. It underscores the influential role of institutional ownership in guiding companies toward enhanced environmental and social performance. Moreover, integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions is critical for sustainable finance. Addressing the intersection of climate change and risk management, the review highlights the implications of environmental risks on financial decision-making. Effective communication strategies can raise public awareness and support for climate policies. The study concludes by calling for collaboration, further research, and policy measures to advance green finance and foster sustainable economic growth. It recommends aligning financial incentives with sustainable outcomes, fostering transparency, and incorporating social equity in green finance initiatives to contribute towards achieving sustainable development goals and promoting a greener future.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Social robots, those that exhibit personality and communicate with us using high-level dialogue and natural cues, will soon be part of our daily lives. In this paper, we gather expert opinions from different international workshops exploring ethical, legal, and social (ELS) concerns associated with social robots. In contrast to literature that looks at specific challenges, often from a certain disciplinary angle, our contribution to the literature provides an overview of the ELS discussions in a holistic fashion, shaped by active deliberation with a multitude of experts across four workshops held between 2015 and 2017 held in major international workshops (ERF, NewFriends, JSAI-isAI). It also explores pathways to address the identified challenges. Our contribution is in line with the latest European robot regulatory initiatives but covers an area of research that the latest AI and robot governance strategies have scarcely covered. Specifically, we highlight challenges to the use of social robots from a user perspective, including issues such as privacy, autonomy, and the dehumanization of interactions; or from a worker perspective, including issues such as the possible replacement of jobs through robots. The paper also compiles the recommendations to these ELS issues the experts deem appropriate to mitigate compounding risks. By then contrasting these challenges and solutions with recent AI and robot regulatory strategies, we hope to inform the policy debate and set the scene for further research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            As part of usability evaluation, users may be invited to offer their reflections on the system being evaluated. Such reflections may concern the system's suitability for its context of use, usability problem predictions, and design suggestions. We term the data resulting from such reflections               users' design feedback               . Gathering users' design feedback as part of usability evaluation may be seen as controversial, and the current knowledge on users' design feedback is fragmented. To mitigate this, we have conducted a literature review. The review provides an overview of the benefits and limitations of users' design feedback in usability evaluations. Following an extensive search process, 31 research papers were identified as relevant and analysed. Users' design feedback is gathered for a number of distinct purposes: to support budget approaches to usability testing, to expand on interaction data from usability testing, to provide insight into usability problems in users' everyday context, and to benefit from users' knowledge and creativity. Evaluation findings based on users' design feedback can be qualitatively different from, and hence complement, findings based on other types of evaluation data. Furthermore, findings based on users' design feedback can hold acceptable validity, though the thoroughness of such findings may be questioned. Finally, findings from users' design feedback may have substantial impact in the downstream development process. Four practical implications are highlighted, and three directions for future research are suggested.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Decades of techno-economic energy policymaking and research have meant evidence from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)\textemdash including critical reflections on what changing a society's relation to energy (efficiency) even means\textemdash have been underutilised. In particular, (i) the SSH have too often been sidelined and/or narrowly pigeonholed by policymakers, funders, and other decision-makers when driving research agendas, and (ii) the setting of SSH-focused research agendas has not historically embedded inclusive and deliberative processes. The aim of this paper is to address these gaps through the production of a research agenda outlining future SSH research priorities for energy efficiency. A Horizon Scanning exercise was run, which sought to identify 100 priority SSH questions for energy efficiency research. This exercise included 152 researchers with prior SSH expertise on energy efficiency, who together spanned 62 (sub-)disciplines of SSH, 23 countries, and a full range of career stages. The resultant questions were inductively clustered into seven themes as follows: (1) Citizenship, engagement and knowledge exchange in relation to energy efficiency; (2) Energy efficiency in relation to equity, justice, poverty and vulnerability; (3) Energy efficiency in relation to everyday life and practices of energy consumption and production; (4) Framing, defining and measuring energy efficiency; (5) Governance, policy and political issues around energy efficiency; (6) Roles of economic systems, supply chains and financial mechanisms in improving energy efficiency; and (7) The interactions, unintended consequences and rebound effects of energy efficiency interventions. Given the consistent centrality of energy efficiency in policy programmes, this paper highlights that well-developed SSH approaches are ready to be mobilised to contribute to the development, and/or to understand the implications, of energy efficiency measures and governance solutions. Implicitly, it also emphasises the heterogeneity of SSH policy evidence that can be produced. The agenda will be of use for both (1) those new to the energy-SSH field (including policyworkers), for learnings on the capabilities and capacities of energy-SSH, and (2) established energy-SSH researchers, for insights on the collectively held futures of energy-SSH research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The AI landscape demands a broad set of legal, ethical, and societal considerations to be accounted for in order to develop ethical AI (eAI) solutions which sustain human values and rights. Currently, a variety of guidelines and a handful of niche tools exist to account for and tackle individual challenges. However, it is also well established that many organizations face practical challenges in navigating these considerations from a risk management perspective within AI governance. Therefore, new methodologies are needed to provide a well-vetted and real-world applicable structure and path through the checks and balances needed for ethically assessing and guiding the development of AI. In this paper, we show that a multidisciplinary research approach, spanning cross-sectional viewpoints, is the foundation of a pragmatic definition of ethical and societal risks faced by organizations using AI. Equally important are the findings of cross-structural governance for implementing eAI successfully. Based on evidence acquired from our multidisciplinary research investigation, we propose a novel data-driven risk assessment methodology, entitled DRESS-eAI. In addition, through the evaluation of our methodological implementation, we demonstrate its state-of-the-art relevance as a tool for sustaining human values in the data-driven AI era.},

This effort has been shared by EU Member States which were all encouraged to develop their own national AI strategies outlining policies and investment levels. This study focuses on how EU Member States are approaching the promise to develop and use AI for the good of society through the lens of their national AI strategies. In particular, we aim to investigate how European countries are investing in AI and to what extent the stated plans contribute to the good of people and society as a whole. Our contribution consists of three parts: (i) a conceptualization of AI for social good highlighting the role of AI policy, in particular, the one put forward by the European Commission (EC); (ii) a qualitative analysis of 15 European national strategies mapping investment plans and suggesting their relation to the social good (iii) a reflection on the current status of investments in socially good AI and possible steps to move forward. Our study suggests that while European national strategies incorporate money allocations in the sphere of AI for social good (e.g. education), there is a broader variety of underestimated actions (e.g. multidisciplinary approach in STEM curricula and dialogue among stakeholders) that can boost the European commitment to sustainable and responsible AI innovation.},

However, AI inputs should not perpetuate the biases and structural issues within our global societies that have created various health inequities. We need AI to~be able to `see' the full context of what it is meant to learn. AI trained with biased data produces biased outputs and providing health workforce training with such outputs further contributes to the buildup of biases and structural inequities. The accelerating and intricately evolving technology and digitalization will influence the education and practice of health care workers. Before we invest in utilizing AI in health workforce training globally, it is important to make sure that multiple stakeholders from the global arena are included in the conversation to address the need for training in `AI               and               the role of AI in training'. This is a daunting task for any one entity and a multi-sectorial interactions and solutions are needed. We believe that partnerships among various national, regional, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training ranging to name a few, from public health \& clinical science training institutions, computer science, learning design, data science, technology companies, social scientists, law, and AI ethicists, need to be developed in ways that enable the formation of an equitable and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP) to address the use of AI for global health workforce training.

  abstract = {Abstract             The internal validity of conclusions about effectiveness or impact in systematic reviews, and of decisions based on them, depends on risk of bias assessments being conducted appropriately. However, a random sample of 50 recently-published articles claiming to be quantitative environmental systematic reviews found 64\% did not include any risk of bias assessment, whilst nearly all that did omitted key sources of bias. Other limitations included lack of transparency, conflation of quality constructs, and incomplete application of risk of bias assessments to the data synthesis. This paper addresses deficiencies in risk of bias assessments by highlighting core principles that are required for risk of bias assessments to be fit-for-purpose, and presenting a framework based on these principles to guide review teams on conducting risk of bias assessments appropriately and consistently. The core principles require that risk of bias assessments be Focused, Extensive, Applied and Transparent (FEAT). These principles support risk of bias assessments, appraisal of risk of bias tools, and the development of new tools. The framework follows a Plan-Conduct-Apply-Report approach covering all stages of risk of bias assessment. The scope of this paper is comparative quantitative environmental systematic reviews which address PICO or PECO-type questions including, but not limited to, topic areas such as environmental management, conservation, ecosystem restoration, and analyses of environmental interventions, exposures, impacts and risks.},

Much research has focused on how such technologies can remove agency and reproduce inequalities through encoded biases. Indeed, many conceptualisations of educational automation are problematic, but less is known about what can be done to take more control over them. By moving away from critique alone, this paper seeks to demystify educational automation and develop a methodology that enables both institutions and staff to take greater control over the technologies in their institutional work. This methodology emerges from multiple research projects exploring digital education, automation, and educational futures and brings together the findings from these to find ways to establish ethical praxis in future forms of educational automation. This methodology and its attendant ethical praxis posit that critique must be used in tandem with creativity and activism to fully realise new and just educational futures.},

Despite rising challenges to the effectiveness of multilateralism, attention to ocean issues appears as an opportunity to co-create pathways to ocean sustainability at multiple levels. The ocean science community, however, is not sufficiently well organised to advance these pathways and provide policy input. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services demonstrate how knowledge consensus and integration have been instrumental in charting global pathways and eliciting commitments to address, respectively, climate change and biodiversity loss. An equally impactful global platform with a thematic focus on ocean sustainability is needed. Here we introduce the International Panel for Ocean Sustainability (IPOS) as a coordinating mechanism to integrate knowledge systems to forge a bridge across ocean science-policy divides collectively. The IPOS will enrich the global policy debate in the Ocean Decade and support a shift toward ocean sustainability.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Two characteristics of the               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               complex (MTC) are particularly relevant for tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology and control, namely the ability of this group of pathogens to survive in the environment and thereby facilitate indirect transmission via water or feed, and the capacity to infect multiple host species including human beings, cattle, wildlife, and domestic animals other than cattle. As a consequence, rather than keeping the focus on certain animal species regarded as maintenance hosts, we postulate that it is time to think of complex and dynamic multi-host MTC maintenance communities where several wild and domestic species and the environment contribute to pathogen maintenance. Regarding the global situation of animal TB, many industrialized countries have reached the Officially Tuberculosis Free status. However, infection of cattle with               M. bovis               still occurs in most countries around the world. In low- and middle-income countries, human and animal TB infection is endemic and bovine TB control programs are often not implemented because standard TB control through testing and culling, movement control and slaughterhouse inspection is too expensive or ethically unacceptable. In facing increasingly complex epidemiological scenarios, modern integrated disease control should rely on three main pillars: (1) a close involvement of farmers including collaborative decision making, (2) expanding the surveillance and control targets to all three host categories, the environment, and their interactions, and (3) setting up new control schemes or upgrading established ones switching from single tool test and cull approaches to integrated ones including farm biosafety and vaccination.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence by principle is developed to assist but also support decision making processes. In our study, we explore how information retrieved from social media can assist decision-making processes for new product development (NPD). We focus on consumers' emotions that are expressed through social media and analyse the variations of their sentiments in all the stages of NPD. We collect data from Twitter that reveal consumers' appreciation of aspects of the design of a newly launched model of an innovative automotive company. We adopt the sensemaking approach coupled with the use of fuzzy logic for text mining. This combinatory methodological approach enables us to retrieve consensus from the data and to explore the variations of sentiments of the customers about the product and define the polarity of these emotions for each of the NPD stages. The analysis identifies sensemaking patterns in Twitter data and explains the NPD process and the associated steps where the social interactions from customers can have an iterative role. We conclude the paper by outlining an agenda for future research in the NPD process and the role of the customer opinion through sensemaking mechanisms.},

The AI ethics research community faces two intertwined challenges: In the first place, we have a tech industry heavily influencing the AI ethics research agenda. Secondly, cleaning up after the tech industry has implied that we have turned to value-driven design methods to bring ethics to AI design. But by framing research questions relevant to a technical practice, we have facilitated the technological solutionism behind the tech industry's business model. Therefore, this paper takes the first steps to reshape the AI ethics research agenda by suggesting moving toward an emancipatory framework that brings politics to design while, at the same time, bearing in mind that AI is not to be treated as an inevitability. As a research community, we must focus on the repressive power dynamics exacerbated by AI and address challenges facing the vulnerable groups seldom heard, despite the fact that they are the ones most negatively affected by AI initiatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            AI governance is like one of those mythical creatures that everyone speaks of but which no one has seen. Sometimes, it is reduced to a list of shared principles such as transparency, non-discrimination, and sustainability; at other times, it is conflated with specific mechanisms for certification of algorithmic solutions or ways to protect the privacy of personal data. We suggest a conceptual and normative approach to AI governance in the context of a global digital public goods ecosystem to enable progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conceptually, we propose rooting this approach in the human capability concept\textemdash what people are able to do and to be, and in a layered governance framework connecting the local to the global. Normatively, we suggest the following six irreducibles:               a               . human rights first;               b               . multi-stakeholder smart regulation;               c               . privacy and protection of personal data;               d               . a holistic approach to data use captured by the 3Ms\textemdash misuse of data, missed use of data and missing data;               e               . global collaboration (`digital cooperation');               f               . basing governance more in practice, in particular, thinking separately and together about data and algorithms. Throughout the article, we use examples from the health domain particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic. We conclude by arguing that taking a distributed but coordinated global digital commons approach to the governance of AI is the best guarantee of citizen-centered and societally beneficial use of digital technologies for the SDGs.},

In recent years, there has also been growing interest in patient partnerships with doctoral studies students. However, it can be difficult to know where to start and how to go about such involvement activities. The purpose of this perspective piece was to share experiential insight of the experience of a patient involvement program such that others can learn from this experience.                                         Body               This is a co-authored perspective piece centred on the experience of MGH, a patient who has had hip replacement surgery, and DG, a medical student completing a PhD, participating in a Research Buddy partnership over the course of over 3 years. The context in which this partnership took place was also described to facilitate comparison with readers' own circumstances and contexts. DG and MGH met regularly to discuss, and work together on, various aspects of DG's PhD research project. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on reflections from DG and MGH regarding their experience in the Research Buddy program to synthesise nine lessons which were then corroborated with reference to published literature on patient involvement in research. These lessons were: learn from experience; tailor the program; get involved early; embrace uniqueness; meet regularly; build rapport; ensure mutual benefit; broad involvement; regularly reflect and review.                                         Conclusions               In this perspective piece, a patient and a medical student completing a PhD reflected upon their experience co-designing a Research Buddy partnership within a patient involvement program. A series of nine lessons was identified and presented to inform readers seeking to develop or enhance their own patient involvement programs. Researcher-patient rapport is foundational to all other aspects of the patient's involvement.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Communication scholars are increasingly concerned with interactions between humans and communicative agents. These agents, however, are considerably different from digital or social media: They are designed and perceived as life-like communication partners (i.e., as ``communicative subjects''), which in turn poses distinct challenges for their empirical study. Hence, in this paper, we document, discuss, and evaluate potentials and pitfalls that typically arise for communication scholars when investigating simulated or non-simulated interactions between humans and chatbots, voice assistants, or social robots. In this paper, we focus on experiments (including pre-recorded stimuli, vignettes and the ``Wizard of Oz''-technique) and field studies. Overall, this paper aims to provide guidance and support for communication scholars who want to empirically study human-machine communication. To this end, we not only compile potential challenges, but also recommend specific strategies and approaches. In addition, our reflections on current methodological challenges serve as a~starting point for discussions in communication science on how meaning-making between humans and machines can be investigated in the best way possible, as illustrated in the concluding section.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Crowdsourcing holds great potential: macro-task crowdsourcing can, for example, contribute to work addressing climate change. Macro-task crowdsourcing aims to use the wisdom of a crowd to tackle non-trivial tasks such as wicked problems. However, macro-task crowdsourcing is labor-intensive and complex to facilitate, which limits its efficiency, effectiveness, and use. Technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) might overcome these limits by supporting the facilitation of crowdsourcing. However, AI's potential for macro-task crowdsourcing facilitation needs to be better understood for this to happen. Here, we turn to affordance theory to develop this understanding. Affordances help us describe action possibilities that characterize the relationship between the facilitator and AI, within macro-task crowdsourcing. We follow a two-stage, bottom-up approach: The initial development stage is based on a structured analysis of academic literature. The subsequent validation \& refinement stage includes two observed macro-task crowdsourcing initiatives and six expert interviews. From our analysis, we derive seven AI affordances that support 17 facilitation activities in macro-task crowdsourcing. We also identify specific manifestations that illustrate the affordances. Our findings increase the scholarly understanding of macro-task crowdsourcing and advance the discourse on facilitation. Further, they help practitioners identify potential ways to integrate AI into crowdsourcing facilitation. These results could improve the efficiency of facilitation activities and the effectiveness of macro-task crowdsourcing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Nearly half of patients do not take their cardiovascular medications as prescribed, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Mobile and digital technologies for health promotion and disease self-management offer an opportunity to adapt behavioral ``nudges'' using ubiquitous mobile phone technology to facilitate medication adherence. The Nudge pragmatic clinical trial uses population-level pharmacy data to deliver nudges via mobile phone text messaging and an artificial intelligent interactive chat bot with the goal of improving medication adherence and patient outcomes in three integrated healthcare delivery systems.                                         Methods               The Theory of mHealth, the Expanded RE-AIM/PRISM, and the PRECIS-2 frameworks were used for program planning, implementation, and evaluation, along with a focus on dissemination and cost considerations. During the planning phase, the Nudge study team developed and piloted a technology-based nudge message and chat bot of optimized interactive content libraries for a range of diverse patients. Inclusion criteria are very broad and include patients in one of three diverse health systems who take medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. A target of approximately 10,000 participants will be randomized to one of 4 study arms: usual care (no intervention), generic nudge (text reminder), optimized nudge, and optimized nudge plus interactive AI chat bot. The PRECIS-2 tool indicated that the study protocol is very pragmatic, although there is variability across PRECIS-2 dimensions.                                         Discussion               The primary effectiveness outcome is medication adherence defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) using pharmacy refill data. Implementation outcomes are assessed using the RE-AIM framework, with a particular focus on reach, consistency of implementation, adaptations, cost, and maintenance/sustainability. The project has limitations including limited power to detect some subgroup effects, medication complications (bleeding), and longer-term outcomes (myocardial infarction). Strengths of the study include the diverse healthcare systems, a feasible and generalizable intervention, transparent reporting using established pragmatic research and implementation science frameworks, strong stakeholder engagement, and planning for dissemination and sustainment.

This work builds on a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis of the literature on RegTech, its influential papers and authors, its main areas of research, its past and its future. The resulting multi-dimensional framework bridges across four main dimensions, starting with regulation and technology, where one or more regulations, not necessarily financial ones, are addressed with the support of technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, DLT, blockchain, smart contracts, API). Data play a central role, as sharing them enables data ecosystems, where additional value can be attained by each market participant, while data automation and machine-readable regulations empower regulators to pull data directly from the banks' systems and combine these data with data obtained directly from customers or other external sources. Several applications emerge, both for regulated entities, covering matters of compliance, monitoring, risk management, reporting and operations, as well as for authorities, which can leverage on RegTech (SupTech) solutions to make policies, to undertake their authorising, supervising and enforcement operations, for monitoring and controlling purposes, and even to issue fines automatically. As a consequence, stakeholders can reap a series of benefits, such as higher efficiency and effectiveness, accuracy, transparency and lower compliance costs but also risks, such as cyber risk, algorithmic biases, and dehumanization.},

It is meant to increase commitment to and quality of models. This paper presents an exploratory study focusing on the subjective view of the domain experts. We investigated the influence of direct collaboration versus individual modeling, and the influence of model revisions by modeling experts on psychological ownership and perceived model quality. We chose process modeling as a particular form of enterprise modeling. Our results give hint that domain experts working individually with a modeling expert perceive model quality as higher than those working collaboratively whereas psychological ownership did not show any difference. Revisions caused changes in the subjects' assessments only of model quality. Moreover, we will present qualitative results from interviews we led with the participants. They reveal interesting insight on how outcome and perception of the procedure and the method in both settings can be positively influenced. The interviews also emphasize the special role of the method experts who are sometimes even considered as co-owners of the model.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The urgency of sustainability transition requires large incumbents in the food industry to implement sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI). However, the high concentration of the food sector and the complexity of the sustainability concept make its understanding and overall transition challenging and slow. Incumbents would need to drive the transition by redesigning business models and practices and acquiring new competencies to integrate sustainability into their innovation strategy. This paper has a twofold aim: (I) analyzing the evolution of sustainability understanding over time and (II) evaluating the extent of dynamic capabilities of food incumbents to foster SOI. We developed an integrated theoretical framework combining the theory of dynamic capabilities with aspects of SOI and applied it to the case of the Norwegian food industry. We interviewed eight food incumbents and one food industry association, and we reviewed their annual and sustainability reports from 2016 till 2020. Key findings show a high strategic activity in SOI, as well as a notable and industry-wide ambiguity about what sustainability means in the food sector. Most companies reveal both an adaptive and expanding behavior implementing conscious sustainability-integrated product and process innovations. Most innovations are incremental without a radical modification of business models. Some exceptions have been detected resembling transformative changes. Clear initiatives of moving away from a linear supply chain to a more systematic approach are currently happening through food system collaborations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Change management is the embodiment of an enterprise's core competence. It provides competitive differentiation and effectively adapts to the ever-changing world. This paper explores the implications of intelligent finance on change management and provides insights into how organizations can effectively manage change to achieve the desired outcomes. The study examines the case of Ping An (Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd.), a leading insurance company in China that has successfully implemented intelligent finance and change management strategies. The paper begins with a literature review that provides an overview of the concept of intelligent finance, the relevance of change management in the context of intelligent finance, models, and frameworks for intelligent finance, and approaches to change management. The study then presents a case analysis of Ping An, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, regression analysis, and qualitative findings. The paper concludes with implications for practice and theory, contributions of the study, and recommendations for future research. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing literature on intelligent finance and change management and provides practical insights for organizations seeking to adopt intelligent finance.},

Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable.},

Therefore, the goal of complexity management is to reduce uncertainty in order to minimize or avoid the need for design changes in a late phase of product development or in the use phase. With our approach we model the uncertainties with probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian decision network explicitly, as the uncertainties are directly attached to parts of the design artifact               {${'}$}               s model. By modeling the incomplete information expressed by unobserved variables in the Bayesian network in terms of probabilities, as well as the variation of product properties or parameters, a conclusion about the robustness of the product can be made. The application example of a rotary valve from engineering design shows that the decision network can support the engineer in decision-making under uncertainty. Furthermore, a contribution to knowledge formalization in the development project is made.},

This article aims at providing a systematic overview of the current state of the emerging research field of Universal Design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Emergency Management, and to highlight high-impact research opportunities to ensure that the increasing introduction of ICT in Emergency Management can contribute to removing barriers instead of adding more barriers, in particular for the elderly and people with disabilities. A systematic review on relevant literature on Universal Design, ICT and Emergency Management between 2008 and 2020 was employed using predefined frameworks, to answer the following questions: (1) Who are the target audiences (stakeholders) in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management in the different categories of Emergency Management ICT tools, and to what degree is Human-Centred Design and Universal Design taken into account? (2) What are the most important challenges and gaps in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management? We identify a set of gaps in the literature, indicating that there are some challenges where Universal Design is still limitedly addressed in technology development. We also derive promising future research topics based on areas that are missing in the literature.},

Yet, relations of views, such as requirements documents, are scarcely considered. This is remarkable as requirements documents and their structure are a key factor in requirements reuse, which is still challenging. Explicit formalized relations between documents can help to ensure consistency, improve completeness, and facilitate review activities in general. For example, this is relevant in space engineering, where many challenges related to complex document dependencies occur: 1.~Several contractors contribute to a project. 2.~Requirements from standards have to be applied in several projects. 3.~Requirements from previous phases have to be reused. We exploit the concept of ``layered traceability'', explicitly considering documents as views on sets of individual requirements and specific traceability relations on and between all of these representation layers. Different types of relations and their dependencies are investigated with a special focus on requirement reuse through standards and formalized in an Object-Role Modelling~(ORM) conceptual model. Automated analyses of requirement graphs based on this model are able to reveal document inconsistencies. We show examples of such queries in Neo4J/Cypher for the EagleEye case study. This work aims to be a step toward a better support to handle highly complex requirement document dependencies in large projects with a special focus on requirements reuse and to enable automated quality checks on dependent documents to facilitate requirements reviews.},

Such a view entails that ML models are not deemed isolated entities, but rather tools, used for specific purposes and potentially impacting their social environment in manifold ways. This shift of perspective opens up a new problem space and facilitates rethinking criteria for model evaluation. By drawing on the adequacy-for-purpose view in philosophy of science, epistemic norms and desiderata for an adequate deployment of ML models along the dimensions of Social Objectives, Measurement, Social Dynamics, and interaction are then identified. The account thus developed also highlights why any auditing of ML models that ought to assist in consequential decision-making cannot be limited to an assessment of statistical properties, but needs to incorporate a variety of methods from the social sciences instead. Moreover, while the process of model evaluation might be deemed as a mere technical exercise, it is in fact riddled by epistemic and morally normative considerations.},

The paper examines the implications of the emerging regulation,               AI regulatory sandboxes               and               Machine Learning Operations               (MLOps) as tools that facilitate compliance while enabling co-learning and active participation of multiple stakeholders. We propose a framework that fosters experimentation with automation pipelines and continuous monitoring for the deployment of future public sector AI-based services in a regulatory-compliant and technically innovative manner. AI regulatory sandboxes can be beneficial as a space for contained experimentation that goes beyond regulatory considerations to specific experimentation with the implementation of ML frameworks. While the paper presents a framework based on emerging regulations, tools and practices pertaining to the responsible use of AI, this must be validated through pilot experimentation with public and private stakeholders and regulators in different areas of high-risk AI-based services.},

However, rarely do these sensing systems inform transformation towards urban sustainability. Drawing on four global urban case examples, we conceptualize how passive and active sensing systems should be harnessed to secure an inclusive, sustainable and resilient urban transformation. We derive principles for stakeholders highlighting the need for an iterative dialogue along a sensing loop, new modes of governance enabling direct feeding of sensed information, an account for data biases in the sensing processes and a commitment to high ethical standards, including open access data sharing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Semantic interoperability establishes intercommunications and enables data sharing across disparate systems. In this study, we propose an ostensive information architecture for healthcare information systems to decrease ambiguity caused by using signs in different contexts for different purposes. The ostensive information architecture adopts a consensus-based approach initiated from the perspective of information systems re-design and can be applied to other domains where information exchange is required between heterogeneous systems. Driven by the issues in FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) implementation, an ostensive approach that supplements the current lexical approach in semantic exchange is proposed. A Semantic Engine with an FHIR knowledge graph as the core is constructed using Neo4j to provide semantic interpretation and examples. The MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) datasets and diabetes datasets have been employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information architecture. We further discuss the benefits of the separation of semantic interpretation and data storage from the perspective of information system design, and the semantic reasoning towards patient-centric care underpinned by the Semantic Engine.},

Such reports beg the question as to why such systems continue to be funded, developed and deployed despite the many published ethical AI principles. This paper focusses on the funding processes for AI research grants which we have identified as a gap in the current range of ethical AI solutions such as AI procurement guidelines, AI impact assessments and AI audit frameworks. We highlight the responsibilities of funding bodies to ensure investment is channelled towards trustworthy and safe AI systems and provides case studies as to how other ethical funding principles are managed. We offer a first sight of two proposals for funding bodies to consider regarding procedures they can employ. The first proposal is for the inclusion of a Trustworthy AI Statement' section in the grant application form and offers an example of the associated guidance. The second proposal outlines the wider management requirements of a funding body for the ethical review and monitoring of funded projects to ensure adherence to the proposed ethical strategies in the applicants Trustworthy AI Statement. The anticipated outcome for such proposals being employed would be to create a `stop and think' section during the project planning and application procedure requiring applicants to implement the methods for the ethically aligned design of AI. In essence it asks funders to send the message ``if you want the money, then build trustworthy AI!''.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital technology is here to stay. Currently, digital technologies are unleashing the fourth industrial revolution. This so-called digital transformation is about the integration of digital technology into all areas of society. Within organisations, work is fundamentally changing which impacts how organisations will operate and deliver value to customers. Furthermore, but often forgotten, it is also about a~cultural change that requires organisations to continually challenge their status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure.             Digital possibilities are emerging which cannot be viewed separately from social effects in organised (eco-)systems and for people in those systems. The challenge is to jointly optimise technical and social aspects for creating both added value in a~sustainable manner and improve quality of working life. As we have an `organisational choice', technical possibilities can be aligned with social needs and requirements, and vice versa. This alignment forms the basis of socio-technical systems (STS) thinking, which is necessary for developing sustainable organisational solutions. Sociotechnical theory and practice originally have a~focus on optimising social and technical aspects in organisations. Therefore, we choose in this essay for an STS perspective, especially for the STS Design (STS-D) approach which is elaborated by the Lowlands STS school of thought. As digital technologies offer new affordances and constraints for organisational design, we aim, with this essay, to merge STS-D with digital thinking.             We start with a~brief sketch of the understanding of current digital technologies. After this, we discuss organisational design in terms of the division of labour and the penetration of digital technology into the nature of work. Then, the STS-D's core design principles and design sequence, specifically from the Lowlands school of thought, are introduced and adapted for digital thinking. This is followed by a~section on design routines for unlocking the potential for designing future, digital-receptive workplaces and organisations. We end the essay with some closing remarks and reflections.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Substantial research is underway to develop next-generation interventions that address current malaria control challenges. As there is limited testing in their early development, it is difficult to predefine intervention properties such as efficacy that achieve target health goals, and therefore challenging to prioritize selection of novel candidate interventions. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development using mathematical models of malaria dynamics coupled with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage, and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence.                                         Methods               A mathematical model of malaria transmission dynamics is used to simulate deployment and predict potential impact of new malaria interventions by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. We couple the disease model with machine learning to search this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identify optimal intervention properties that achieve specified health goals.                                         Results               We apply our approach to five malaria interventions under development. Aiming for malaria prevalence reduction, we identify and quantify key determinants of intervention impact along with their minimal properties required to achieve the desired health goals. While coverage is generally identified as the largest driver of impact, higher efficacy, longer protection duration or multiple deployments per year are needed to increase prevalence reduction. We show that interventions on multiple parasite or vector targets, as well as combinations the new interventions with drug treatment, lead to significant burden reductions and lower efficacy or duration requirements.                                         Conclusions               Our approach uses disease dynamic models and machine learning to support decision-making and resource investment, facilitating development of new malaria interventions. By evaluating the intervention capabilities in relation to the targeted health goal, our analysis allows prioritization of interventions and of their specifications from an early stage in development, and subsequent investments to be channeled cost-effectively towards impact maximization. This study highlights the role of mathematical models to support intervention development. Although we focus on five malaria interventions, the analysis is generalizable to other new malaria interventions.                                         Graphical abstract},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The avifauna endemic to islands is particularly susceptible to population declines and extinctions resulting from the introduction of non-native pathogens. Three pathogens of concern are the avian malaria parasites, the avian poxviruses, and West Nile virus\textemdash each of which can be transmitted by               Culex quinquefasciatus               , a highly adaptive and invasive mosquito.               Culex quinquefasciatus               has dramatically expanded its range in recent centuries and is now established throughout much of the tropics and sub-tropics, including on many islands that are remote from mainland landmasses and where this geographic separation historically protected island species from mosquito-borne diseases. The potential for ecological disruption by               Cx. quinquefasciatus               has been particularly striking in the Hawaiian Islands, where the introduction and transmission of avian malaria and avian poxvirus led to the extinction of several endemic bird species, with many more at risk. With               Cx. quinquefasciatus               now present in many insular communities and global trade and tourism increasing links between these areas, both to each other and to mainlands, there is growing concern that patterns of avian decline in Hawai`i may be played out in other insular ecosystems. The implementation of traditional methods for               Cx. quinquefasciatus               control, including larval source management, is often impractical at large scale and when breeding sites are numerous and difficult to locate\textemdash typical issues associated with invasive species removal. One alternative approach would be the utilisation of genetic control methods, several of which have been successfully developed in other mosquitos such as               Aedes aegypti               and the malaria vector               Anopheles gambiae               . However, the development of similar tools for               Cx. quinquefasciatus               has been comparatively limited. Here we review the threat that               Cx. quinquefasciatus               poses as a vector of avian pathogens to island avifauna and discuss specific examples of at-risk bird populations on the islands of Hawai`i, New Zealand and Gal\'apagos. We also review the major options for the deployment of genetic control tools against               Cx. quinquefasciatus               , and discuss the current state of the field with a focus on radiation-based sterilisation, transgenic methods, and transinfections using the bacterial endosymbiont               Wolbachia               .},

The concept of sustainability is receiving increasing attention, and sustainable manufacturing is evolving. The digital twin is an emerging technology used in intelligent manufacturing that can grasp the state of intelligent manufacturing systems in real-time and predict system failures. Sustainable intelligent manufacturing based on a digital twin has advantages in practical applications. To fully understand the intelligent manufacturing that provides the digital twin, this study reviews both technologies and discusses the sustainability of intelligent manufacturing. Firstly, the relevant content of intelligent manufacturing, including intelligent manufacturing equipment, systems, and services, is analyzed. In addition, the sustainability of intelligent manufacturing is discussed. Subsequently, a digital twin and its application are introduced along with the development of intelligent manufacturing based on the digital twin technology. Finally, combined with the current status, the future development direction of intelligent manufacturing is presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Humans are exposed to multiple chemicals on a daily basis instead of to just a single chemical, yet the majority of existing toxicity data comes from single-chemical exposure. Multiple factors must be considered such as the route, concentration, duration, and the timing of exposure when determining toxicity to the organism. The need for adequate model systems (in vivo, in vitro, in silico and mathematical) is paramount for better understanding of chemical mixture toxicity. Currently, shortcomings plague each model system as investigators struggle to find the appropriate balance of rigor, reproducibility and appropriateness in mixture toxicity studies. Significant questions exist when comparing single-to mixture-chemical toxicity concerning additivity, synergism, potentiation, or antagonism. Dose/concentration relevance is a major consideration and should be subthreshold for better accuracy in toxicity assessment. Previous work was limited by the technology and methodology of the time, but recent advances have resulted in significant progress in the study of mixture toxicology. Novel technologies have added insight to data obtained from in vivo studies for predictive toxicity testing. These include new in vitro models: omics-related tools, organs-on-a-chip and 3D cell culture, and in silico methods. Taken together, all these modern methodologies improve the understanding of the multiple toxicity pathways associated with adverse outcomes (e.g., adverse outcome pathways), thus allowing investigators to better predict risks linked to exposure to chemical mixtures. As technology and knowledge advance, our ability to harness and integrate separate streams of evidence regarding outcomes associated with chemical mixture exposure improves. As many national and international organizations are currently stressing, studies on chemical mixture toxicity are of primary importance.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation is a growing technological field, which gradually becomes integrated into existing programs. However, technology has to support human behavior and -needs, including social relatedness, to achieve health-related outcomes. Elderly people have high risk of loneliness, and VR has technological affinity for natural social interaction. Previous studies have relied on competitiveness rather than collaborative elements, but research shows that competitiveness can lead to (feelings of) stress and aggressive behavior in some individuals. This article presents a mixed methods study to gather end-user feedback on a social VR scenario that encourages inter-player collaboration on a virtual tandem bike.

Participants biked on average 10.7 ({$\pm~$}3) minutes with a mean speed of 14.8 kmph ({$\pm~$}5.8). The results indicate potential and feasibility for the collaborative social biking application. Participants reported excellent usability-scores (85 {$\pm~$}5), high intrinsic motivation in all categories: enjoyment (6.5 {$\pm~$}0.5), effort/importance (6.4 {$\pm~$}0.3), relatedness (6.3 {$\pm~$}0.7) and minimal increase in symptoms of nausea, oculomotor and disorientation. Furthermore, participants found the social aspect enjoyable, agreed that collaboration eased tasks and that they lost track of exercise duration. Interpersonal interaction between participants varied, but was mostly positively rated valence, even if the sense of copresence was limited by physical constraints and avatar representation. Most participants expressed that they would use the program again, but future studies should explore how to improve location and appearance of the virtual coactor, as well as implement additional tasks.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung                            Digitalisierung ist ein pr\"asenter Faktor in vielen St\"adten. So existieren bereits viele               Smart-City               -Initiativen, bei denen St\"adte versuchen, ihre Prozesse durch Erfassung und Verkn\"upfung von Daten, oft unter Zuhilfenahme von Datenplattformen, zu optimieren. In Anbetracht der damit einhergehenden gro\ss en Investitionen und Ver\"anderungen wird B\"urgerbeteiligung als zentraler Faktor f\"ur den Erfolg solcher Initiativen betrachtet. Bisher ist allerdings nicht klar, was typische Beteiligungsformate von Smart-City-Initiativen sind und welche Rolle(n) B\"urgerInnen dabei einnehmen. Dieser Beitrag leitet mittels einer Literaturanalyse zu Smart Cities ein Kategorienschema zu typischen B\"urgerbeteiligungsarten ab. Die Analyse ergab, dass sich Einbindung von B\"urgerInnen in politische Entscheidungen und bei der Entwicklung technischer Artefakte ma\ss geblich auf e-Government oder Participatory Design bezieht. Im Hinblick auf die Beteiligungsarten zeigt sich, dass Makrofabriken,               Living Labs               und               Open-Data               -Plattformen h\"aufige Ans\"atze sind, um B\"urgerInnen als               Co-Creators               einzubinden. Zudem werden B\"urgerInnen mit               Citizen Sensing               zur Erfassung von Daten oder Missst\"anden einbezogen. Dabei zeigen sich sowohl aktivere, als auch eher passive Beteiligungsarten. Die Analyse zeigt, dass die Einbindung von B\"urgerInnen h\"aufig entweder auf eine Beteiligung an politischen Entscheidungen oder an der Entwicklung technischer Artefakte abzielt. Auch wenn keine klare Abgrenzung m\"oglich ist, sind diese Ans\"atze dann eher durch e-Government oder Participatory Design inspiriert.                        ,              Abstract             Digitalization is currently a~prominent factor in many cities. Already, many smart city initiatives exist that thrive to optimize processes by gathering and connecting data, often using data platforms. Considering the enormous financial investments and great changes, citizen participation is seen as a~major success factor for such initiatives. So far it is unclear, what typical participation modes are in this context and which roles citizens take on in each. Therefore, this contribution reviews literature on smart city initiatives to derive categories of typical participation modes. Regarding typical participation mode, we find that citizens are involved as co-creators in micro factories, living labs, and open data platforms. In addition, with citizen sensing they are involved as data collectors. Other participation modes are geared towards political participation and aim for either active or passive participation. The analysis shows that participation aims either for political participation or for participation in the technical development. Although no clear separation can be made, the efforts are thus inspired mainly by e-government or participatory design.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Drawing from Feminist Science and Technology Studies, this paper explores how we might revisit and recuperate past academic research projects, theories, and relationships to design futures that matter for social good. As context, I begin by outlining a decade of research in Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD), which linked the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to innovations in telecommunications and computing. I then introduce the `theory of design-reality gaps' that was proposed by Heeks to study 'wicked problems' in this domain (2002). I revisit two strands of research that I carried out in relation to the `design-reality gap'. The first involved an ethnographic study of a participatory mobile phone based learning intervention for Kenyan health workers. I argued that instead of a singular `gap' explained by geographic, sociocultural, or economic `divides', there was a messy entanglement, constituted by sociomaterial practices that enacted a multiplicity (Mol in~The body multiple: Ontology in medical practice, Duke University Press,~2002) of desired futures. In the second strand, I attempted to care for the practices that were abandoned by the learning intervention when one kind of justice was prioritized over others. This explored how the research could be more `speculative' and how this `speculative commitment' could generate new ethical questions and logics for living with technology (Puig de la Bellacasa in~Social Studies of Science, 41(1), 85\textendash 106,~2011~and~Matters of care: Speculative ethics in more than human worlds, University of Minnesota Press,~2017). I argue that approaching the design-reality `gap' as a multiplicity instead of a void can support Tuck's call for educational interventions that turn away from damage oriented theories of change to ones based on               desire               \textendash{} approaching difference not as a lack, but as an ever-growing assemblage (2009). Tinkering with the original Heeks model, I conclude that in the postdigital era, the design-reality gap is now better-understood as a fluid space of multiplicities, and what is arguably most pressing is to study the differences in competing objectives and values, rather than disparities in information and technology.},

Nevertheless, damaging events are often unavoidable due to a wide and dynamic threat landscape and enabled by the increasing complexity of modern systems. For overall performance and risk control at the system level, resilience can be a versatile option, in particular for reducing resources needed for system development, maintenance, reuse, or disposal. This paper presents a framework for a resilience assessment and management process that builds on existing risk management practice before, during, and after potential and real events. It leverages tabular and matrix correlation methods similar as standardized in the field of risk analysis to fulfill the step-wise resilience assessment and management for critical functions of complex systems. We present data needs for the method implementation and output generation, in particular regarding the assessment of threats and the effects of counter measures. Also included is a discussion of how the results contribute to the advancement of functional risk control and resilience enhancement at system level as well as related practical implications for its efficient implementation. The approach is applied in the domains telecommunication, gas networks, and indoor localization systems. Results and implications are further discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable physiological and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices. Their use has revolutionized clinical research by enabling high-frequency, longitudinal, and sensitive measurements. In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, an example of a digital biomarker-based technology is instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) digital medical application, a predictive biomarker of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) to dementia due to AD in individuals aged 55\,+\,. Digital biomarkers show promise to transform clinical practice. Nevertheless, their use may be affected by variables such as demographics, genetics, and phenotype. Among these factors, sex is particularly important in Alzheimer's, where men and women present with different symptoms and progression patterns that impact diagnosis. In this study, we explore sex differences in Altoida's digital medical application in a sample of 568 subjects consisting of a clinical dataset (MCI and dementia due to AD) and a healthy population. We found that a biological sex-classifier, built on digital biomarker features captured using Altoida's application, achieved a 75\% ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic \textemdash{} area under curve) performance in predicting biological sex in healthy individuals, indicating significant differences in neurocognitive performance signatures between males and females. The performance dropped when we applied this classifier to more advanced stages on the AD continuum, including MCI and dementia, suggesting that sex differences might be disease-stage dependent. Our results indicate that neurocognitive performance signatures built on data from digital biomarker features are different between men and women. These results stress the need to integrate traditional approaches to dementia research with digital biomarker technologies and personalized medicine perspectives to achieve more precise predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and customized treatment of cognitive decline.},

Despite recent progress, it remains challenging for urban decision-makers to incorporate the benefits of natural infrastructure into urban design and planning. Here, we present an approach to support the greening of cities by quantifying and mapping the diverse benefits of natural infrastructure for now and in the future. The approach relies on open-source tools, within the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) software, that compute biophysical and socio-economic metrics relevant to a variety of decisions in data-rich or data-scarce contexts. Through three case studies in China, France, and the United States, we show how spatially explicit information about the benefits of nature enhances urban management by improving economic valuation, prioritizing land use change, and promoting inclusive planning and stakeholder dialogue. We discuss limitations of the tools, including modeling uncertainties and a limited suite of output metrics, and propose research directions to mainstream natural infrastructure information in integrated urban management.},

The Postdigital Applied Systems Science Education (PASSE) framework presented in this paper highlights the need for greater investment in educational infrastructures that support the development of collective intelligence, teamwork, and system design skills. We propose that the implementation of PASSE involves group- and project-based work focused on developing (1) an understanding of systems, (2) an understanding of group dynamics relevant to the management and design of systems, and (3) skill in the application of applied systems science methods that can be used by groups in the management and redesign of systems. To showcase curricular and pedagogical challenges and opportunities, we describe key features of our current delivery of PASSE along with future plans and prospects. Aligned with postdigital perspectives and innovations at the nexus of biology, information, and society, we highlight the potential for ongoing redesign of educational infrastructures and technologies that enhance societal teamwork and system design capabilities that allow us to address increasingly complex societal challenges.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The work on the factory floor is gradually changing to resemble knowledge work due to highly automated manufacturing machines. In the increasingly automated work environment, the machine operator's task is to keep the production running and to solve possible problems quickly. This work is expected to become more autonomous, which raises the importance of supporting the workers' well-being. An important aspect of that is giving concrete feedback of success at work as well as feedback on physical and mental load. We implemented a smartphone optimized web application, Worker Feedback Dashboard that offers feedback to machine operators about their well-being at work and personally relevant production data as well as their connections to each other. The feedback is personal and based on objective, near real-time measurements. We present the results of a field study, in which ten machine operators used the application for 2\textendash 3~months. We studied the operators' user experience, usage activity, perceived benefits and concerns for the application with questionnaires, interviews and application log data. The operators found the feedback interesting and beneficial, and used the application actively. The perceived benefits indicate impacts on well-being as well as on work performance. Based on the results, we highlight three design implications for quantified worker applications: presenting meaningful overviews, providing guidance to act based on the feedback and refraining from too pervasive quantification not to narrow down the meaningful aspects in one's work.},

Organisation               , diskutiert das Zusammenspiel der Konzepte soziotechnische Systeme und digitale Souver\"anit\"at. Die jeweiligen theoretischen Hintergr\"unde werden betrachtet und funktionale Beziehungen zwischen den beiden Gegenstandsbereichen hergeleitet. Es wird ein soziotechnischer Ansatz vorgeschlagen, mit dem Bewertungs- und Gestaltungskriterien f\"ur Handlungskontexte abgeleitet werden k\"onnen, die der digitalen Souver\"anit\"at von Unternehmen und Besch\"aftigten zutr\"aglich sind. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden im Artikel zwei empirische Analyse- und Gestaltungsfelder skizziert: Im ersten empirischen Feld wird der Ansatz zur partizipativen Gestaltung von industriellen Arbeitsumgebungen eingesetzt, die durch die Einf\"uhrung fortgeschrittener algorithmischer Systeme bzw. KI-Systemen (K\"unstliche Intelligenz) neu gepr\"agt werden. Solche KI-basierten Systeme stellen u.\,A. wegen ihrer inh\"arenten Intransparenz eine gro\ss e Herausforderung f\"ur Gestaltungen im Sinne digitaler Souver\"anit\"at dar. In einem Workshop mit 50~Teilnehmenden aus verschiedenen Wirtschaftsunternehmen und Forschungseinrichtungen wurde dazu eine Matrix zur soziotechnischen Analyse von Arbeitsumgebungen entlang realer Fallbeispiele angewendet. Die drei Fallbeispiele stammten aus den Anwendungsfeldern Automobil, Brauerei und Verpackungstechnik. In allen drei F\"allen geht es um die Integration von KI-gest\"utzten Methoden in bestehende Arbeitsabl\"aufe. Die Methode erlaubt eine strukturierte Interaktion mit synchroner Visualisierung von Gestaltungsideen, die f\"ur co-kreative Formate f\"orderlich ist. Das zweite empirische Anwendungsfeld, auf das der soziotechnische Ansatz angewendet wurde, fokussiert die digitale Souver\"anit\"at auf der Organisationsebene von Unternehmen und Einrichtungen. In der betrachteten Studie wurde erforscht, wie Organisationen mit den Herausforderungen der COVID-19-Pandemie umgegangen sind. Analysiert wurden f\"unf Branchen (Einzelhandel, Gesundheitswirtschaft einschlie\ss lich Pflege, \"Offentliche Verwaltung, Unternehmensnahe Dienstleistungen, \"Offentlicher Personennahverkehr) mit je vier Fallstudien, die die Auswirkungen der Krise auf der Grundlage leitfadengest\"utzter Interviews sowohl mit der Arbeitgeber- als auch mit der Arbeitnehmerseite abbilden. Dabei zeigt sich, dass Zusammenh\"ange zwischen den Merkmalen soziotechnischer Systeme und digitaler Souver\"anit\"at auch hier Interpretationshilfen bieten.                        ,              Abstract                            Our contribution to the journal               Group. Interaction. Organization               , discusses the interplay between the concepts of sociotechnical system and digital sovereignty. The respective theoretical backgrounds are considered and functional relationships between the two subject areas are derived. A~sociotechnical approach is proposed that can be used to develop evaluation and design criteria for contexts of action that are conducive to the digital sovereignty of companies and employees. Against this background, the article outlines two empirical fields of analysis and design: In the first empirical field, the approach is applied to the participatory design of industrial work environments that are being reshaped by the introduction of advanced algorithmic systems or AI (artificial intelligence) systems. Such AI-based systems pose a~major challenge for design in terms of digital sovereignty, among other things because of their inherent opacity. In a~workshop with 50~participants from various business enterprises and research institutions, a~matrix for the socio-technical analysis of work environments was applied along real case studies. The three case studies came from the application fields of automotive, brewery and packaging technology. All three cases involve the integration of AI-supported methods into existing workflows. The method allows structured interaction with synchronous visualization of design ideas, which is conducive to co-creative formats. The second empirical application field to which the socio-technical approach was applied focuses on digital sovereignty at the organizational level of companies and institutions. The study under consideration explored how organizations dealt with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five industries were analyzed (retail, health care including nursing, public administration, business-related services, public transport), each with four case studies mapping the impact of the crisis based on guided interviews with both the employer and employee sides. This shows that correlations between the characteristics of socio-technical systems and digital sovereignty also offer interpretative aids here.},

Setting               United Kingdom.                                         Participants               32 key stakeholders across the medical device sector were identified both from the public and private sectors.                                         Results               Opportunities relating to regulatory independence were identified, including the potential to create and implement a regulatory framework that ensures availability of medical devices; innovation and investment potential; and safety to the citizens of the UK. The most significant risks identified included threats to the safety of individual patients and the wider health system arising from the delay in awaiting regulatory approval due to the shortage of approved bodies; and reduced competitiveness of UK market and device manufacturers. Recommendations were identified to mitigate risks, centred on harnessing broader cross-sector collaborations, promoting patient and public partnership, and maximizing international engagement.                                         Conclusions               The UK's medical device sector is at a time-critical juncture to construct a regulatory framework to navigate its exit of Europe and respond to Europe's transition to new medical device regulations whilst also addressing the ongoing demand for rapid approval for new devices in response to the global pandemic. Investment, capacity-building, and international engagement will play a central role in mitigating risks and maximizing opportunities for medical device regulation.},

This paper explores the role of participatory agenda-setting in creating governance infrastructures that reflect community participation, boundary object creation, and experimental innovation for increased understanding of future decision tradeoffs. Drawing upon the authors' leadership and participant observation of two participatory agenda-setting projects, this paper contributes to our understanding of what participatory agenda-setting looks like in practice at a boundary organization in higher education. Though not a traditional research study with control and experiment groups, we seek to share our insights and lessons learned from our leadership of two projects with inherent participatory agenda-setting components. The paper culminates in recommendations for future projects which seek to incorporate laypeople into future-oriented research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition?                                         Methods               Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.                                         Review findings               During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests.                                         Conclusions               The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies. Therefore, generalization of the results must be done carefully.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Overprescribing of antibiotics is a major concern as it contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Research has found highly variable antibiotic prescribing in (UK) primary care, and to support more effective stewardship, the BRIT Project (Building Rapid Interventions to optimise prescribing) is implementing an eHealth Knowledge Support System. This will provide unique individualised analytics information to clinicians and patients at the point of care. The objective of the current study was to gauge the acceptability of the system to prescribing healthcare professionals and highlight factors to maximise intervention uptake.                                         Methods                                Two mixed-method co-design workshops were held online with primary care prescribing healthcare professionals (                 n                 \,=\,16). Usefulness ratings of example features were collected using online polls and online whiteboards. Verbal discussion and textual comments were analysed thematically using inductive (participant-centred) and deductive perspectives (using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability).                                                        Results                                Hierarchical thematic coding generated three overarching themes relevant to intervention use and development. Clinician c                 oncerns                 (focal issues) were safe prescribing, accessible information, autonomy, avoiding duplication, technical issues and time.                 Requirements                 were ease and efficiency of use, integration of systems, patient-centeredness, personalisation, and training. Important                 features                 of the system included extraction of pertinent information from patient records (such as antibiotic prescribing history), recommended actions, personalised treatment, risk indicators and electronic patient communication leaflets. Anticipated acceptability and intention to use the knowledge support system was moderate to high. Time was identified as a focal cost/ burden, but this would be outweighed if the system improved patient outcomes and increased prescribing confidence.                                                        Conclusion               Clinicians anticipate that an eHealth knowledge support system will be a useful and acceptable way to optimise antibiotic prescribing at the point of care. The mixed method workshop highlighted issues to assist person-centred eHealth intervention development, such as the value of communicating patient outcomes. Important features were identified including the ability to efficiently extract and summarise pertinent information from the patient records, provide explainable and transparent risk information, and personalised information to support patient communication. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability enabled structured, theoretically sound feedback and creation of a profile to benchmark future evaluations. This may encourage a consistent user-focused approach to guide future eHealth intervention development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Nowadays, digitalization has an immense impact on the landscape of jobs. This technological revolution creates new industries and professions, promises greater efficiency and improves the quality of working life. However, emerging technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are reducing human intervention, thus advancing automation and eliminating thousands of jobs and whole occupational images. To prepare employees for the changing demands of work, adequate and timely training of the workforce and real-time support of workers in new positions is necessary. Therefore, it is investigated whether user-oriented technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be applied ``on-the-job'' for such training and support\textemdash also known as intelligence augmentation (IA). To address this problem, this work synthesizes results of a systematic literature review as well as a practically oriented search on augmented reality and virtual reality use cases within the IA context. A total of 150 papers and use cases are analyzed to identify suitable areas of application in which it is possible to enhance employees' capabilities. The results of both, theoretical and practical work, show that VR is primarily used to train employees without prior knowledge, whereas AR is used to expand the scope of competence of individuals in their field of expertise while on the job. Based on these results, a framework is derived which provides practitioners with guidelines as to how AR or VR can support workers at their job so that they can keep up with anticipated skill demands. Furthermore, it shows for which application areas AR or VR can provide workers with sufficient training to learn new job tasks. By that, this research provides practical recommendations in order to accompany the imminent distortions caused by AI and similar technologies and to alleviate associated negative effects on the German labor market.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Today, due to growing computing power and the increasing availability of high-quality datasets, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering many areas of our everyday life. Thereby, however, significant ethical concerns arise, including issues of fairness, privacy and human autonomy. By aggregating current concerns and criticisms, we identify five crucial shortcomings of the current debate on the ethics of AI. On the threshold of a third wave of AI ethics, we find that the field eventually fails to take sufficient account of the business context and deep societal value conflicts the use of AI systems may evoke. For even a perfectly fair AI system, regardless of its feasibility, may be ethically problematic, a too narrow focus on the ethical implications of technical systems alone seems insufficient. Therefore, we introduce a business ethics perspective based on the normative theory of contractualism and conceptualise ethical implications as conflicts between values of diverse stakeholders. We argue that such value conflicts can be resolved by an account of deliberative order ethics holding that stakeholders of an economic community deliberate the costs and benefits and agree on rules for acceptable trade-offs when AI systems are employed. This allows AI ethics to consider business practices, to recognise the role of firms, and ethical AI not being at risk to provide a competitive disadvantage or in conflict with the current functioning of economic markets. By introducing deliberative order ethics, we thus seek to do justice to the fundamental normative and political dimensions at the core of AI ethics.},

One of these settings, and the focus of this paper, is the museum. This paper provides an overview of the literature on how robots can help people within the museum context and explores the state-of-the-art methods or technologies employed by researchers to allow robots to interact within this environment. Five key features were found to be essential to integrate into social museum robots:               social navigation               (including safe and successful motions);               perception               (how robots can use visual skills to understand the environment);               speech               (verbal communication with visitors);               gestures               (non-verbal cues) and               behavior generation               (how the robot combines the four skills to adopt different behaviors). The paper subsequently analyzes the integration of these features into robotic systems for a complete and appropriate collection of behaviors in the museum setting.},

In order to make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3) knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5) knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

In this paper we examine what it means to provide explainable AI. We report on research findings to propose that explanations should be tailored, depending upon the role of the human interacting with the system and the individual system components, to reflect different needs. We demonstrate that a `one-size-fits-all' explanation is insufficient to capture the complexity of needs. Thus, designing explainable AI systems involves careful consideration of context, and within that the nature of both the human and AI components.},

Many efficiencies and improvements are likely, but there are also potential dangers, including the threat of harmful impacts on third parties, discriminatory practices, data and privacy breaches, fraudulent practices and even `rogue AI'. To address these dangers, the EU published `The Expert Group's Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy AI' (the Guidelines). The Guidelines produce seven principles from its four foundational pillars of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explicability. If implemented by business, the impact on corporate governance will be substantial. Fundamental questions at the intersection of ethics and law are considered, but because the Guidelines only address the former without (much) reference to the latter, their practical application is challenging for business. Further, while they promote many positive corporate governance principles\textemdash including a stakeholder-oriented (`human-centric') corporate purpose and diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness\textemdash it is clear that their general nature leaves many questions and concerns unanswered. In this paper we examine the potential significance and impact of the Guidelines on selected corporate law and governance issues. We conclude that more specificity is needed in relation to how the principles therein will harmonise with company law rules and governance principles. However, despite their imperfections, until harder legislative instruments emerge, the Guidelines provide a useful starting point for directing businesses towards establishing trustworthy AI.},

  abstract = {Abstract             While previous entrepreneurship research has only seldom drawn on organizational ambidexterity, the analysis of the important contemporary tensions among entrepreneurship, innovation management and strategic management issues may be facilitated by more closely analysing organizational ambidexterity in entrepreneurial settings. In this paper, we follow this thinking and more closely analyse an often applied form of corporate entrepreneurship: automation. Such automation is transferring work that was formerly conducted by humans to machines and may thus result in new tensions between corporate entrepreneurship, innovation management and the management of organizational stakeholders such as employees. The present paper investigates whether increased automation lowers the stability of firms' relationships with their employees. In addition, we expect that this relationship is moderated by organizational ambidexterity, as employees may have perceived ambidexterity as a signal that their firm will not overly invest in exploitation only, but maintain a balance between exploitation and exploration. Drawing on stakeholder theory, previous insights into corporate entrepreneurship and a survey of German Mittelstand firms, our findings show that highly ambidextrous firms are indeed more vulnerable to automation, leading to lower employee relational stability. Our findings thus suggest that in highly ambidextrous firms, novel tensions around automation-related corporate entrepreneurship will be detrimental to the stability of the firm's relations with one of its key stakeholder groups: employees.},

Conclusions               Different modelling approaches are needed to predict rather than explain patient reported outcomes. We developed a parsimonious and pragmatic PRM. External validation is required prior to translation to digital tool and evaluation of clinical implementation. The routine use of PROs and data driven PRM in practice provides a new opportunity to target supportive care and specialist interventions for cancer patients.},

Understanding the ways these actors are taking action and how they align with each other and national governments is critical given the need for coordinated actions to achieve ambitious global climate goals. Here, we present a large analysis (n\,=\,9,326), applying large-scale natural language processing methods and social network analysis to the climate~strategy documents of countries, regions, cities and companies. We find that climate mitigation in employee travel and office operations, green building standards, and municipal and citizen actions are common themes in climate actions across companies and city and regional governments, whereas approaches to setting targets in specific sectors and emissions scopes are more diverse. We also find links between the strategies of regions and countries, whereas companies are disconnected. Gaps in climate action for most actors include adaptation and consumption/supply-chain emission reduction efforts. We suggest that although actors~may appear to be self-organizing and allocating climate actions in a mutually beneficial and synergistic way, there may also be missed opportunities for deeper coordination that could result in more ambitious action.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Personal virtual assistants (PVAs) based on artificial intelligence are frequently used in private contexts but have yet to find their way into the workplace. Regardless of their potential value for organizations, the relentless implementation of PVAs at the workplace is likely to run into employee resistance. To understand what motivates such resistance, it is necessary to investigate the primary motivators of human behavior, namely emotions. This paper uncovers emotions related to organizational PVA use, primarily focusing on threat emotions. To achieve our goal, we conducted an in-depth qualitative study, collecting data from 45 employees in focus-group discussions and individual interviews. We identified and categorized emotions according to the framework for classifying emotions Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) designed. Our results show that loss emotions, such as dissatisfaction and frustration, as well as deterrence emotions, such as fear and worry, constitute valuable cornerstones for the boundaries of organizational PVA use.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The use of data generated passively by personal electronic devices, such as smartphones, to measure human function in health and disease has generated significant research interest. Particularly in psychiatry, objective, continuous quantitation using patients' own devices may result in clinically useful markers that can be used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices, improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes, such as early signs of relapse, and develop new intervention models. If a principal goal for digital phenotyping is clinical improvement, research needs to attend now to factors that will help or hinder future clinical adoption. We identify four opportunities for research directed toward this goal: exploring intermediate outcomes and underlying disease mechanisms; focusing on purposes that are likely to be used in clinical practice; anticipating quality and safety barriers to adoption; and exploring the potential for digital personalized medicine arising from the integration of digital phenotyping and digital interventions. Clinical relevance also means explicitly addressing consumer needs, preferences, and acceptability as the ultimate users of digital phenotyping interventions. There is a risk that, without such considerations, the potential benefits of digital phenotyping are delayed or not realized because approaches that are feasible for application in healthcare, and the evidence required to support clinical commissioning, are not developed. Practical steps to accelerate this research agenda include the further development of digital phenotyping technology platforms focusing on scalability and equity, establishing shared data repositories and common data standards, and fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between clinical stakeholders (including patients), computer scientists, and researchers.},

By comparing argument for stakeholder involvement in literature as well as on our own experiences in six stakeholder involvement workshops, we argue that it is probably unrealistic to fully achieve both normative and co-design goals in a single workshop. Furthermore, stakeholder involvement can help to acquire insight into dependencies in the market and offer an opportunity to connect people to deal with them. Therefore we propose for future stakeholder involvement initiatives for CBE to focus on (1) identify relationships of dependency which make it hard for players in the market to change, (2) develop strategies to change while mitigating the detrimental effects on already existing relationships and (3) gradually breaking down relationships and building new ones that support CBE.},

It carries out the data management during the whole period from site analysis to later operation, and provides technical support and collaborative work platform for a built asset project. Based on the environmental improvement project of the Green-Water Wetland in the Nanjing reach of the Yangtze River, the BIM technology provides a fast and efficient communication platform for all partners involved in the construction period, and has been successfully and efficiently applied in the site design, model analysis, building design, and landscape design. Green-Water Wetland is located on the shoreline of the Nanjing reach of the Yangtze River. The main task of this project is to return the fishpond to the wetland, restore the forest, and improve the landscape of the whole wetland. The specific applications of BIM technology are as follows: (1) It provides a fast and efficient communication platform for all partners involved in the construction period, and couples with the application of GIS and other digital technologies; (2) The Revit and Civil3D software were carried out to realize 3D design of the real scene, and visually display the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme; (3) The preprocessing efficiency of data was greatly improved which lays the foundation for subsequent digital analog analysis; (4) The Mars software was used to render the design scheme in real time, intuitively express the design intention, and avoid repeated design.},

We first               describe               what discrimination is in a case study of Chicago's PPA. We then               explain               their causes with Broadbent's contrastive model of causation and causal diagrams. Based on the cognitive science literature, we also explain why fairness is not an objective truth discoverable in laboratories but has context-sensitive social meanings that need to be negotiated through democratic processes. With the above analysis, we next               predict               why some recommendations given in the bias reduction literature are not as effective as expected. Unlike the clich\'e highlighting equal participation for all stakeholders in predictive policing, we emphasize power structures to avoid hermeneutical lacunae. Finally, we aim to               control               PPA discrimination by proposing a governance solution\textemdash a framework of a social safety net.},

The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an integrated global action plan for sustainable development. However, it remains a great challenge to develop actionable strategies to achieve regional sustainability within social-environmental constraints. Here we proposed a framework, integrating safe and just operating space (SJOS) with SDGs, to assess regional sustainability and interactions between environmental performance and human well-being across scales. Despite China has not fully achieved sustainable development from 2000 to 2018, most provinces have shown significant improvements. Our analyses further delineated four development patterns (i.e., coupled and developed, coupled and underdeveloped, uncoupled and underdeveloped, and coupled and underdeveloped), and developed targeted strategies and pathways for each pattern to transition towards sustainability. Our operationalizable framework is broadly applicable to other regions or nations to actualize sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a~normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a~bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a~sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time.           ,              Zusammenfassung             In den letzten Jahren wurden in unterschiedlichen Studien die Chancen von K\"unstlicher Intelligenz (KI) f\"ur unsere Gesellschaft herausgearbeitet. KI-L\"osungen k\"onnen z.\,B. dabei helfen Umweltverschmutzung zu reduzieren, den Kohlenstoff-Fu\ss abdruck oder den Abfall zu verringern. Dem gegen\"uber stehen aber auch Risiken, die mit der Nutzung von KI verbunden sind, wie z.\,B. die Erh\"ohung der Ungleichheit in der Gesellschaft. Dieser Beitrag geht der Frage nach, in welcher Form die Unternehmenskultur die Nutzung von K\"unstlicher Intelligenz im Sinne einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung unterst\"utzen kann. Diese Art der Nutzung beinhaltet ein normatives Element und wird in dem Beitrag als Sustainable Artificial Intelligence (SAI) bezeichnet. Auf Basis einer bibliografischen Literaturanalyse wird aufgezeigt, mit welchen Merkmalen eine nachhaltigkeitsorientierte Unternehmenskultur beschrieben werden kann. In sechs Propositionen wird zusammengefasst, welchen Einfluss diese Merkmale auf den Umgang mit KI im Sinne von SAI haben. Demnach erscheint die Unternehmenskultur f\"ur Unternehmen, die sicherstellen m\"ochten, dass SAI realisiert wird, zugleich als wichtiger Indikator und Einflussfaktor.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper aims to identify and classify the challenges and issues faced by the energy sector in digitizing distributed energy operation and services using digital platforms. It contributes to two fields: information systems (IS) in the domain of platforms ecosystems and digital services innovation and the field of energy informatics in the domain of digital business models and service innovation. Through a systematic literature review, we investigate current research on digitalization and digital platforms in the context of electrical energy services and identify challenges and areas for future research. The key challenges are then classified into two categories, each with three subcategories: Architectural challenges, including aspects of design, ecosystem management, and agility and openness; and business and regulatory challenges, including contracts and relationship management, business models, and standards. The main limitation of this study is that it does not focus on a specific geographic domain, which means that the results are somewhat general and may not be applicable to certain countries or regions. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research directions in the digitalization and platformization of the energy sector in all six-sub-areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Discussions on the use of digital health to advance health have continued to gain traction over the past decades. This is important considering the rising penetration of mobile phones and other digital technologies and the opportunity to leverage those digital and electronic health methods and innovations to accelerate Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the health Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Nigeria, however, the full benefits of digital technologies to strengthen the health systems are yet to be fully harnessed due to critical challenges in the sector. These challenges include but not limited to weak health systems governance, weak infrastructural investments, inadequate resources, weak human resource capacity, high cost of scaling-up and coordination issues among others. Lack of systems thinking, and design have significant impact on coordination of efforts and has resulted in the fragmentation and non-interoperability among various applications. To discuss these challenges and propose the way forward for rapid sustainable, scalable and cost-effective deployment of digital health in Nigeria, a digital health capacity development workshop was held in Abuja and across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria from 20th \textendash{} 30th November 2019. This paper documents key conclusions and achievements at the workshop.                                         Methods               The workshop was organized around eleven modules and seven thematic areas which explored the Nigerian digital health governance and coordinating mechanisms in view of its status, leadership, financing and deployment for effective service delivery. It was attended by over 100 participants from varied background including Ministries of Health, Ministries of Communications and Digital Economy, International Organizations, Operators, Civil Society, Academia and Private Sector Experts.                                         Results               The workshop resolved that while digital health technologies offer profound opportunities to strengthen Nigerian health systems for UHC and the health SDGs, there should be a move from donor-driven pilot projects to robust, sustainable, cost-effective and nationally owned projects. This will involve a people-centered approach that should be demand-driven and not supply-driven to avoid wasting time on ineffective interventions, duplication of efforts and wastage of scarce health resources. Government ownership and leadership was identified as critical for sustainable financing and effective scale up of Digital Health projects in Nigeria.                                         Conclusions               The DH capacity development workshop was a good forum to deliberate important issues regarding sustainable and cost-effective DH solutions that could be scaled to strengthen health service delivery in Nigeria. Insightful ideas for scaling DH in Nigeria and other related settings emanated from the workshop, necessitating the need for a focused government commitment and leadership in institutionalizing digital health in Nigeria.},

Such an approach has not been spelled out yet for bioethics, while there are frequent calls for ethical guidance of biomedical innovation, also by biomedical researchers themselves. New and emerging biotechnologies require anticipation of possible effects and implications, meaning the scope is not evaluative after a technology has been fully developed or about hypothetical technologies, but real-time for a real biotechnology.                                         Main text               In this paper we aim to substantiate and discuss six ingredients that we increasingly see adopted by ethicists and that together constitute ``ethics parallel research''. This approach allows to fulfil two aims: guiding the development process of technologies in biomedicine and providing input for the normative evaluation of such technologies. The six ingredients of ethics parallel research are: (1) disentangling wicked problems, (2) upstream or midstream ethical analysis, (3) ethics from within, (4) inclusion of empirical research, (5) public participation and (6) mapping societal impacts, including hard and soft impacts. We will draw on gene editing, organoid technology and artificial intelligence as examples to illustrate these six ingredients.                                         Conclusion               Ethics parallel research brings together these ingredients to ethically analyse and proactively or parallel guide technological development. It widens the roles and judgements from the ethicist to a more anticipatory and constructively guiding role. Ethics parallel research is characterised by a constructive, rather than a purely critical perspective, it focusses on developing best-practices rather than outlining worst practice, and draws on insights from social sciences and philosophy of technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The discipline of plant pathology has an expanding remit requiring a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach to capture the complexity of interactions for any given disease, disease complex or syndrome. This review discussed recent developments in plant pathology research and identifies some key issues that, we anticipate, must be faced to meet the food security and environmental challenges that will arise over coming decades. In meeting these issues, the challenge in turn is for the plant pathology community to respond by contributing to a wider forum for multidisciplinary research, recognising that impact will depend not just on advances in the plant pathology discipline alone, but on interactions more broadly with other agricultural and ecological sciences, and with the needs of national and global policies and regulation. A challenge more readily met once plant pathologists again gather physically at international meetings and return to the professional and social encounters that are fertile grounds for developing new ideas and forging collaborative approaches both within plant pathology and with other disciplines. In this review we emphasise, in particular: the multidisciplinary links between plant pathology and other disciplines; disease management, including precision agriculture, plant growth and development, and decision analysis and disease risk; the development and use of new and novel plant protection chemicals; new ways of exploiting host genetic diversity including host resistance deployment; a new perspective on biological control and microbial interactions; advances in surveillance and detection technologies; invasion of exotic and re-emerging plant pathogens; and the consequences of climate change affecting all aspects of agriculture, the environment, and their interactions. We draw conclusions in each of these areas, but in reaching forward over the next few decades, these inevitably lead to further research questions rather than solutions to the challenges we anticipate.},

In actual engineering projects, there are two modeling ways, Method I: direct BIM design modeling, Method II: transformation and modeling after CAD design. The difference between Method I and Method II mainly sits on the difference in presentation form. One is three-dimensional and the other is two-dimensional. However, the base of both of them representing pipeline information is attributes and data. As long as these attributes and data can be extracted, information integration can be realized and applied to project management in the later stage. Based on the integrated research on the airport pipeline information, a corresponding BIM collaboration and management and control platform has been developed for the Project, and research results have been applied to the actual management of the project pipeline in an exploratory way, so as to achieve the project management requirements of the airport pipeline in terms of design, progress, cost, prefabrication and processing, and prepare for the later digital delivery and intelligent operation and maintenance management.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In many industries, traditional automation systems (operating technology) such as PLCs are being replaced with modern, networked ICT-based systems as part of a drive towards the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The intention behind this is to use more cost-effective, open platforms that also integrate better with an organisation's information technology (IT) systems. In order to deal with heterogeneity in these systems, middleware platforms such as EdgeX Foundry, IoTivity, FI-WARE for Internet of Things (IoT) systems are under development that provide integration and try to overcome interoperability issues between devices of different standards. In this paper, we consider the EdgeX Foundry IIoT middleware platform as a transformation engine between field devices and enterprise applications. We also consider security as a critical element in this and discuss how to prevent or mitigate the possibility of several security risks. Here we address secure data access control by introducing a declarative policy layer implementable using Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE). Finally, we tackle the interoperability challenge at the application layer by connecting EdgeX with DIME, a model-driven/low-code application development platform that provides methods and techniques for systematic integration based on layered Domain-Specific Languages (DSL). Here, EdgeX services are accessed through a Native DSL, and the application logic is designed in the DIME Language DSL, lifting middleware development/configuration to a DSL abstraction level. Through the use of DSLs, this approach covers the integration space domain by domain, technology by technology, and is thus highly generalizable and reusable. We validate our approach with an example IIoT use case in smart manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The Systematic Review (SR) Toolbox was developed in 2014 to collate tools that can be used to support the systematic review process. Since its inception, the breadth of evidence synthesis methodologies has expanded greatly. This work describes the process of updating the SR Toolbox in 2022 to reflect these changes in evidence synthesis methodology. We also briefly analysed included tools and guidance to identify any potential gaps in what is currently available to researchers.                                         Methods               We manually extracted all guidance and software tools contained within the SR Toolbox in February 2022. A single reviewer, with a second checking a proportion, extracted and analysed information from records contained within the SR Toolbox using Microsoft Excel. Using this spreadsheet and Microsoft~Access, the SR Toolbox was updated to reflect expansion of evidence synthesis methodologies and brief analysis conducted.                                         Results                                The updated version of the SR Toolbox was launched on 13 May 2022, with 235 software tools and 112 guidance documents included. Regarding review families, most software tools (                 N                 = 223) and guidance documents (                 N                 = 78) were applicable to systematic reviews. However, there were fewer tools and guidance documents applicable to reviews of reviews (                 N                 = 66 and                 N                 = 22, respectively), while qualitative reviews were less served by guidance documents (                 N                 = 19). In terms of review production stages, most guidance documents surrounded quality assessment (                 N                 = 70), while software tools related to searching and synthesis (                 N                 = 84 and                 N                 = 82, respectively). There appears to be a paucity of tools and guidance relating to stakeholder engagement (                 N                 = 2 and                 N                 = 3, respectively).                                                        Conclusions               The SR Toolbox provides a platform for those undertaking evidence syntheses to locate guidance and software tools to support different aspects of the review process across multiple review types. However, this work has also identified potential gaps in guidance and software that could inform future research.},

The participatory research events, described in detail in this article, centered around the theme of ecology and served to design an application that would allow us to conduct field research on pro-environmental behaviours at a larger scale. As a result we developed a research application, rooted in local culture and history and place attachment, which makes use of gamification techniques. The application gathers air quality data from the densest network of air pollution sensors in Europe, thereby aligning the visible signs of pollution in the app with the local sensor data. At the same time it reinforces the users' pro-environmental habits and exposes them to educational messages about air quality and the environment. The data gathered with this application will validate the efficacy of this kind of an intervention in addressing residents' smog-causing behaviours.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A series of Community Pharmacy Agreements (Agreements) between the Federal government and a pharmacy-owners' body, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia (PGA) have been influential policy in Australian community pharmacy (CP) since 1990. While ostensibly to support the public's access and use of medicines, the core elements of the Agreements have been remuneration for dispensing and rules that limit the establishment of new pharmacies. Criticism has focused on the self-interest of pharmacy owners, the exclusion of other pharmacy stakeholders from the Agreement negotiations, the lack of transparency, and the impact on competition. The objective of this paper is to determine the true nature of the policy by examining the evolution of the CPA from a policy theory perspective.                                         Methods               A qualitative evaluation of all seven Agreement documents and their impact was undertaken using policy theories including a linear policy development model, Multiple Streams Framework, Incremental Theory, the Advocacy Coalition Framework, the Theory of Economic Regulation, the Punctuated Equilibrium Framework, and Elite Theory. The Agreements were evaluated using four lenses: their objectives, evidentiary base, stakeholders and beneficiaries.                                         Results               The PGA has acted as an elite organisation with long-standing influence on the policy's development and implementation. Notable has been the failure of other pharmacy stakeholders to establish broad-based advocacy coalitions in order to influence the Agreements. The incremental changes negotiated every 5~years to the core elements of the Agreements have supported the publics' access to medication, provided stability for the government, and security for existing pharmacy owners. Their impact on the evolution of pharmacists' scope of practice and through that, on the public's safe and appropriate use of medication, has been less clear.                                         Conclusions               The Agreements can be characterised predominantly as industry policy benefiting pharmacy owners, rather than health policy. An emerging issue is whether incremental change will continue to be an adequate policy response to the social, political, and technological changes that are affecting health care, or whether policy disruption is likely to arise.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Exploring the specific field of care robot orientation generates many questions regarding the meaning, content and how it should be conducted. The issue is important due to the general digitalisation and implementation of welfare technology and care robots. The aim of the study was to explore perceptions of care robot orientation from the potential users' perspective. Data were collected by focus group interviews in Finland, Germany and Sweden. In all three countries, potential user groups were represented: older adults, relatives, professional caregivers and care service managers. A qualitative descriptive method was used for analysing data. The data revealed three aspects of care robot orientation: (1)               What               care robot orientation is, (2)               Who               needs it and by               Whom               it should be given and (3)               How               it should be performed. The need for care robot orientation is general in society. In the absence of knowledge about care robots, it is nearly impossible to know what to ask for or actually seek information about. Therefore, care robot orientation must be founded on agile implementation planning for care robots, with a firm basis in trustworthy knowledge and information and respecting individuals' wishes. This also gives rise to an ethical challenge when care robots are offered to people having reduced decision-making ability (dementia, cognitive impairment), along with the issue of who then should make the decision. The mapping of the               What               ,               Who/Whom               and               How               aspects of care robot orientation offers a foundation for the creation of orientation models, which might facilitate structured and goal-oriented care robot orientation strategies.},

However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent evidence-based chatbot-learner interaction design techniques applied in education. This study presents a systematic review of 36 papers to understand, compare, and reflect on recent attempts to utilize chatbots in education using seven dimensions: educational field, platform, design principles, the role of chatbots, interaction styles, evidence, and limitations. The results show that the chatbots were mainly designed on a web platform to teach computer science, language, general education, and a few other fields such as engineering and mathematics. Further, more than half of the chatbots were used as teaching agents, while more than a third were peer agents. Most of the chatbots used a predetermined conversational path, and more than a quarter utilized a personalized learning approach that catered to students' learning needs, while other chatbots used experiential and collaborative learning besides other design principles. Moreover, more than a third of the chatbots were evaluated with experiments, and the results primarily point to improved learning and subjective satisfaction. Challenges and limitations include inadequate or insufficient dataset training and a lack of reliance on usability heuristics. Future studies should explore the effect of chatbot personality and localization on subjective satisfaction and learning effectiveness.},

We evaluated three Operator 4.0 solutions that aim to empower and engage workers, so that workers can understand and develop their own competences and they can take an active role in developing the manufacturing environment. 118 shop stewards from different factories assessed user experience, user acceptance and foreseen impacts of the solutions. The results show that there are high expectations towards the virtual factory-based participatory design solution. Opinions were shared about empowering the worker by feedback about worker well-being and work achievements. The solution was seen interesting and useful but there were doubts regarding privacy. Contextual knowledge sharing was felt important but the workers were a bit skeptical as many previous knowledge sharing attempts had been failed. The results give insight to how the solutions should be further developed and how the solutions should be introduced at factory floor.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The right of people with special educational needs and disabilities to be educated alongside their typically developing peers is a fundamental human right protected by national laws and international conventions. However, education systems around the world still face the challenge of providing effective education for all children and young people. Nowadays, academic research on the implementation of inclusive education has shifted from ``where'' students should be educated to ``what'' and ``how'' they should be taught. Although teachers express willingness to implement inclusive education pedagogy, they nevertheless state that they lack educational materials and even encounter difficulties in creating their educational resources due to a lack of expertise. In this context and under the current research imperatives in inclusive education regarding the benefits of digital transformation, an inclusive transmedia application based on gamification techniques, called ``Waking Up In the Morning'' (WUIM), was designed and developed to supply an integrated educational method that can be applied in inclusive learning environments. The purpose of WUIM providing content for teaching Activities of Daily Living is to emphasize the participatory design for developing inclusive learning materials, while also using formative assessment elements that actively engage end-user. The conclusions of the formative assessment were drawn from the data collected to answer the main research question: ``Can educational applications, based on transmedia learning principles, cutting-edge technology and game elements support inclusive education?``. Since for every educational innovation, it is necessary to identify teachers' opinions about it, two parallel surveys were conducted on teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and digital games for learning and teaching. Based on the results, it can be concluded that teachers were hesitant in both cases, a reluctance that was not solely driven by ideological barriers but also by a lack of training in educational practices. This work highlights the lessons learned about teachers' attitudes regarding inclusive education and digital educational games, the pedagogical foundations of game design, the power of transdisciplinary teamwork, and the affordances of virtual reality, augmented reality and digital games to support education and treatment of individuals with special educational needs and/or disabilities in inclusive settings.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Electronic traceability (e-traceability) is a growing trend in the agri-food industry, offering improved transparency, accountability, and reduced risk of foodborne illnesses through the use of electronic systems to trace products throughout the entire supply chain. E-traceability drivers in the agri-food supply chain encompass diverse factors motivating companies to adopt electronic systems for product tracking, aiming to enhance visibility, minimize risk, ensure compliance, and promote safety, sustainability, and efficiency through clear and verifiable records of product origins, quality, and sustainability, building consumer trust and loyalty. By identifying the main drivers of e-traceability, this research aims to shed light on the factors that motivate companies to implement electronic systems for tracking and monitoring products. For solving this problem of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), this study proposes a hybrid MCDM model. The model combines ``Factor Relationship'' (FARE) and ``Axial Distance-based Aggregated Measurement'' (ADAM) methods in the fuzzy environment. The results indicate that the most important drivers are supply chain efficiency, technology development and sustainability. These drivers are critical and they significantly impact the successful implementation and adoption of e-traceability strategies in the agri-food sector.},

Therefore, it has become important to address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young programmers and older adults participants. Below we describe a case study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar events and an improved process of developing apps that target older adults.},

Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal (2-months) field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

The world has witnessed a situation where resource optimization through mitigation strategies has become significant for sustainable construction. A circular economy keeps the resources in the loop for the longest possible, eliminating waste from the system. This paper attempts to identify the parameters and relevant indicators for bringing circularity to the construction industry. During the research, 144 indicators were identified through a literature review which was followed by a three-round Delphi survey to attain consensus from 30 experts. Finally, after three rounds, 78 indicators were shortlisted, which received maximum consensus among the experts (W\,=\,0.75). Construction stakeholders and decision-makers can use the identified list of indicators to bring circularity to the construction industry.},

The aim of this initiative is toward producing guidance that encompasses both technical (e.g. system impact assessments) and non-engineering (e.g. human oversight) components to governance and represents a significant milestone in the movement towards standardising AI governance. This paper will summarise and critically evaluate the ICO effort and try to anticipate future debates and present some general recommendations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Misinformation in social media is an actual and contested policy problem given its outreach and the variety of stakeholders involved. In particular, increased social media use makes the spread of misinformation almost universal. Here we demonstrate a framework for evaluating tools for detecting misinformation using a preference elicitation approach, as well as an integrated decision analytic process for evaluating desirable features of systems for combatting misinformation. The framework was tested in three countries (Austria, Greece, and Sweden) with three groups of stakeholders (policymakers, journalists, and citizens). Multi-criteria decision analysis was the methodological basis for the research. The results showed that participants prioritised information regarding the actors behind the distribution of misinformation and tracing the life cycle of misinformative posts. Another important criterion was whether someone intended to delude others, which shows a preference for trust, accountability, and quality in, for instance, journalism. Also, how misinformation travels is important. However, all criteria that involved active contributions to dealing with misinformation were ranked low in importance, which shows that participants may not have felt personally involved enough in the subject or situation. The results also show differences in preferences for tools that are influenced by cultural background and that might be considered in the further development of tools.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The USAID-funded Building Healthy Cities (BHC) work in Da Nang, Vietnam, engaged 108 multi-sector stakeholders to gather qualitative data across two workshops and three citizen town halls from 2019 to 2021. These data were synthesized with the results from BHC's seven other activities in Da Nang to build systems maps. Contextual findings showed that multi-sector, multi-level participation and collaboration have been the key to moving the city toward their smart and livable city goals. Currently, citizen, nongovernmental organization, and private sector collaboration are low for many government sectors, which results in policy and programs that are mismatched to actual needs and therefore have less powerful impacts. When these policies and programs are implemented, they struggle to demonstrate strong benefits to these stakeholder groups, further decreasing participation. This is central to the systems map that BHC developed, and is expanded upon through additional patterns that fall within four main areas: management quality; vision and leadership; workforce capacity; and community engagement. Stakeholders found four key leverage points within this context that, if included in every action, could help overcome barriers. These leverage opportunities are: (1) investing at all levels; (2) improving function and innovation of information technology; (3) increasing participation and feedback; and (4) creating more responsive policy. As BHC concludes activities in Da Nang, local university students will be trained on systems mapping techniques to embed systems thinking skills into the next generation of workforce, and a set of recommendations will be developed to share with the government to act on these findings.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Since the seminal work of Albert and Whetten, the organizational identity concept has become ubiquitous and highly relevant in various fields. This study systematically reviews how Albert and Whetten's concept of organizational identity has been disseminated in different research areas. It employs quantitative (topic modeling) and qualitative text analysis, as well as a network analysis to examine a sample of 1,041 papers published between 1985 and mid-2022 that cite Albert and Whetten's seminal work. Using this method of systematic literature analysis, the current study investigates the criteria of the basic definition and hypotheses mentioned in their work that contribute to its increasing significance, and those with the potential to become substantial aspects of future organizational identity research. Accordingly, Albert and Whetten's conceptualization of organizational identity is often partially adopted in the literature. Thus, this study contributes to organizational identity research by unveiling further research questions on the evolving character of organizational identity, research methodology, and quantitative operationalization, on the basis of Albert and Whetten's organizational identity conceptualization.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Covid-19, one of the most critical and widespread global pandemics, has resulted in extraordinary risk corollaries engulfing millions of people's lives and has caused an unprecedented economic downturn while amplifying food insecurity. A systematic review of 132 scientific communications~was performed over a 15-year period, using articles from the ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases (2006\textendash 2021). In addition, 24 policy briefs, country papers, and publications from the UN, WHO, FAO, and OECD were cited. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on agricultural food systems, as well as potential strategies for building robust, resilient, and sustainable food systems to ensure global food security, safety, and endeavors regarding future global emergencies, as well as new research policies while achieving SDG targets. This would fill~a research gap while also having long-term implications for health, agricultural, and food resilience policy development in a rapidly changing world. Covid-19 demonstrates how human, animal, and environmental health are all interconnected, emphasizing the need for one health legislation and a paradigm shift in planetary health. Furthermore, it identifies potential mechanisms for rebuilding better systems by shifting priorities toward policy coherence, innovative food system governance, re-engineering market access, and nexus thinking in the food system approach. According to our findings, the COVID-19 posed unavoidable impediments to achieving SDG targets for food security and household poverty.                            Graphical abstract},

While this diversity of evidence use is a strength, it also necessitates greater collaboration among interested parties for knowledge exchange. To address this need, we investigate how ecotones, which are hybrid networks operating in the transitional area between two distinct ecosystems, such as academic research and policy ecosystems, must involve, disseminate, and integrate different types of knowledge. Specifically, our research aims to unpack how an ecotone's knowledge brokerage function evolves over its lifecycle. This paper presents the findings of a phenomenological investigation involving experts from the policy and academic research ecosystems. The study introduces a three-stage maturity transitions framework that outlines the trajectory of the brokerage function throughout the ecotone's lifecycle: i. as a service function, ii. a programme-partnership, and iii. a network of networks. The paper contributes to the theory of knowledge brokerage for policy-making. We reflect on our findings and discuss the theoretical contributions within an ecosystem approach and their associated research and policy implications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Conversational agents (CA) are increasingly used to manage and coordinate household chores and everyday activities at home. However, these technologies should be adaptive to age-specific characteristics in order to be considered beneficial for the ageing population. This study presents a participatory design of a conversational agent to provide cognitive support in recipe following and nutrition advice for adults aged 65 and over. Through a qualitative thematic analysis, the study explores older adults' expectations, interactions and experiences with the agent in order to identify age-specific challenges of interacting with CAs. Data consists of a participatory design workshop with eight older adults (aged 65 and over), followed by a Wizard of Oz study with ten older adults interacting with the agent in the kitchen environment in a laboratory setting. Results demonstrate that older adults consider conversational agents as beneficial for providing personalised recipe recommendations, advising the user to choose appropriate ingredients and reminding them of their dietary intake. When interacting with the agent older adults displayed challenges with confirmation and repetition, questioning and correcting, the lack of conversational responses, and difficulties in hearing and understanding the multi-modal interaction. Older adults experience agents as collaborators, but not as conversational partners. The study concludes that the accessibility and inclusiveness of conversational agents regarding voice interaction could be improved by further developing participatory methods with older adults.},

Drawing from our experiences in human, cooperative, and collaborative aspects of software engineering, based on IT-empowerment and participatory design with older and younger adults, we propose and examine some methods, practices and tools for co-designing software for the immersive extended reality continuum (XR), including VR, AR or VUI. In a series of empirical and field studies we examined various experimental setups for stakeholders' participation within and across different steps and phases of the software development process for immersive extended reality environments (IERE). In this article we provide an overview of selected methods, practices and tools, that we found best support communication, collaboration, and cooperation among stakeholders, especially the members of vulnerable groups who are often excluded from the main technological discourse and need more empowerment.},

This paper provides a holistic framework of human-related capabilities that organizations must consider when implementing BDA to facilitate decision-making. For this purpose, the authors conducted a systematic literature review adapted from Tranfield et al. (BJM 14:207\textendash 222, 2003) to identify relevant studies. The 75 publications reviewed provided the sample for an inductive, and systematic data evaluation following the well-known and accepted approach introduced by Gioia et al. (ORM 16:15\textendash 31, 2012). The comprehensive review uncovered 33 first-order concepts linked to human-related capabilities, which were distilled into 15~s-order themes and then merged into five aggregated dimensions: Personnel Capability, Management Capability, Organizational Capability, Culture and Governance Capability, and Strategy and Planning Capability. The study is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to categorize all relevant human-related capabilities for successful BDA application. As such, it not only provides the scientific basis for further research, but also serves as a useful overview of the critical factors for BDA use in decision-making processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Business process management (BPM) is a mature discipline that drives corporate success through effective and efficient business processes. BPM is commonly structured via capability frameworks, which describe and bundle capability areas relevant for implementing process orientation in organizations. Despite their comprehensive use, existing BPM capability frameworks are being challenged by socio-technical changes such as those brought about by digitalization. In line with the uptake of novel technologies, digitalization transforms existing and enables new processes due to its impact on individual behavior and needs, intra- and inter-company collaboration, and new forms of automation. This development led the authors to presume that digitalization calls for new capability areas and that existing frameworks need to be updated. Hence, this study explored which BPM capability areas will become relevant in view of digitalization through a Delphi study with international experts from industry and academia. The study resulted in an updated BPM capability framework, accompanied by insights into challenges and opportunities of BPM. The results show that, while there is a strong link between current and future capability areas, a number of entirely new and enhanced capabilities are required for BPM to drive corporate success in view of digitalization.},

As research on the BSC has matured since its introduction in 1992, it is timely to assess its progress and outline future directions. This study synthesizes extant research and presents avenues to advance the BSC. To accomplish these objectives, we undertake a review employing a bibliometric and systematic methodology on a corpus of 1294 BSC-related studies. The review reveals that the more than 30-year history of BSC research has followed a bell-curve trajectory, with publications appearing in high-quality, multidisciplinary journals and contributions from numerous author groups worldwide. Moreover, the review highlights the evolution of major themes and topics on the BSC, encompassing customer orientation, financial management, integrated reporting, strategic performance management, sustainable development, and systems thinking. Sustainability BSC has also gained prominence due to sustainability firmly establishing itself as a global agenda and grand challenge. Taken collectively, this review serves as a one-stop resource for gaining a state-of-the-art understanding of the trends, developments, and future directions of the BSC.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital platforms are becoming critical infrastructures for supporting a variety of innovative services that enhance our everyday lives. These platforms need to offer not only rational services but also ludic or slow services that focus on human pleasure. One important aspect of creating innovative digital platforms is that their concrete requirements and potential opportunities are vague before they are designed. Thus, designing, prototyping and evaluating digital platforms iteratively is essential for refining or customizing them, as knowledge is gradually gained throughout these iterations. However, it is costly to develop prototype platforms and evaluate them with traditional methods. A better tool that can be used to reveal these platforms' potential opportunities by conceiving them in a simple and rapid way is needed. In this paper, we present our journey to develop nine digital platforms that share collective human sight and hearing with the Human-Material-Pleasure (HMP) annotation method, which is a tool that we use to describe the visually structured annotations of multiple digital platforms based on the annotated portfolio method. The most significant part of the paper presents annotated portfolios based on the HMP annotation method for the nine digital platforms that we develop and shows how these annotated portfolios play an essential role in revealing and exploring the potential opportunities of our platforms during the refinement process. We also discuss how the HMP annotation method is used in the context of exploring the potential opportunities of wearable shape-changing robotic devices; these devices have significantly different characteristics from our digital platforms, which allows for showing insights more objectively by extracting diverse insights from an alternative angle.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To effectively address the challenges posed by the increasing share of the energy sector in global greenhouse effects, the domains of energy informatics and energy citizenship play a critical role. Energy informatics aims at using information systems and channels to reduce energy consumption. However, there is a realization that the challenges posed by global greenhouse effects cannot be catered to alone by the energy information systems. Therefore, there is a need for engaging human inhabitants to actively engage toward more sustainable means (i.e., energy citizenship) thus reducing the energy sector's share in the global greenhouse effect. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) after analysis of (n\,=\,115) articles on the topic to identify (i) the themes considered in energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, and (ii) the interconnection between energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, (iii) energy information needs among stakeholders which establish a clear interconnect with energy citizenship. These identified themes and their interconnections are critical for energy researchers, policymakers, and energy businesses to identify relevant research topics, identify energy consumers' needs, and create just energy transition policies. The paper additionally summarizes the gaps in the state of the art by mentioning the open research questions that arise due to the identified interconnection between energy informatics and energy citizenship.},

The opacity of these applications, however, means that it is not clear how much they truly serve their users. A promising way to address the issue of possible undesired biases consists in giving users control by letting them configure a system and aligning its performance with users' own preferences. However, as the present paper argues, this form of control over an algorithmic system demands an algorithmic literacy that also entails a certain way of making oneself knowable: users must interrogate their own dispositions and see how these can be formalized such that they can be translated into the algorithmic system. This may, however, extend already existing practices through which people are monitored and probed and means that exerting such control requires users to direct a computational mode of thinking at themselves.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Used in the context of innovation-driven economies and civil society, hackathons are a good example of collaborative postdigital design processes and their focus on futures and the~realization of~new ideas. Hackathons are a widespread organizational form of designing the future in which digital solutions (such as apps, websites) are preferred. What becomes questionable in the process of designing, however, is the social form of the future. In our case study, we ask               which               futures are being designed~and by whom               . While empirically, these questions are often answered together, we disentangle them~in our analysis of online announcements of hackathons. We show how a feasible, designable, and achievable future is imagined through practices of problematization and scaling. We demonstrate corresponding models of subjects that are preferred for designing the future. With our praxeological analysis, we aim to contribute to an understanding of the micropowers of designing postdigital futures. While in principle, `everyone' is invited to participate in the design process at hackathons, the announcements already~show that only certain participants are desired, and only certain kinds of futures are imaginable through hackathons.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Both policy-makers and scholars acknowledge and emphasize the need for learning in maritime spatial planning (MSP). However, few explain why learning is important. As such, it remains a vague and understudied process and is taken for granted and assumed to be and do ``only good'' which might hinder an in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of learning in policy-making. In this paper, we investigate whether, and if so in what way, explicit attention is given to learning in MSP. In this way, we try to unpack a (plausible) ``learning paradox'' and gain more insight into the different conceptualizations of learning in MSP. We use seven dimensions to examine learning in MSP by conducting a literature review of scientific MSP literature and a case study, which analyzes learning in the Dutch MSP process. The literature review and case study point to a ``learning paradox'' in MSP, showing both similarities and differences. The common lack of attention for risk and ambiguities is particularly problematic, while the existing clarity about who (should) learn and how can be seen as opportunities to gain insights in learning in MSP. Overall, we argue that acknowledging the paradox is paramount to improve the effectiveness of learning processes in MSP.},

We shed light upon maintenance coordination work by presenting a design case study conducted in an SME over approximately two years. We took a participatory design-oriented approach, involving all roles on the shopfloor affected by maintenance work. In three major iterations during the pre-study, a release-ready prototype was developed and implemented by the users over the course of one year. The evaluation of the tool showed how a new and mostly unintended practice of information flow, error reporting, and prioritization emerged such that, for instance, foremen becoming a central node of communication, formal prioritization shifting away from higher management, and actual prioritization being done by maintainers. This paper contributes to the body of CSCW work on maintenance practice in SMEs by presenting detailed empirical findings on the coordination work of maintainers, as well as the evaluation of socio-technical interventions into maintenance practices.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Cognitive decline is common in the elderly. As a result, a range of cognitive rehabilitation games have been proposed to supplement or replace traditional rehabilitative training by offering benefits such as improved engagement. In this paper, we focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an initial stage of cognitive decline that does not affect functioning in daily life, but which may progress towards more serious cognitive deteriorations, notably dementia. Unfortunately, while a variety of serious game frameworks and rehabilitative serious games have been proposed, there is a distinct lack of those which support the distinctive characteristics of MCI patients. Consequently, to optimise the advantages of serious games for MCI, we propose the               MCI-GaTE               (MCI-Game Therapy Experience) framework that may be used to develop serious games as effective cognitive and physical rehabilitation tools. The framework is derived from a combination of a survey of related research literature in the area, analysis of resident profiles from a nursing home, and in-depth interviews with occupational therapists (OTs) who work with MCI patients on a daily basis. The conceptual framework comprises four sectors that may be used to guide game design and development: an               MCI player profile               that represents the capabilities of a player with MCI,               core gaming elements               that support gameful and playful activities,               therapeutic elements               that support cognitive and physical rehabilitation through tasks and scenarios according to the player's abilities, and               motivational elements               to enhance the player's attitude towards the serious tasks. Together, they provide support for rehabilitation needs and may also serve as a set of comprehensive and established criteria by which an MCI serious game may be evaluated. To demonstrate the use of               MCI-GaTE               , we also present               A-go!               , an immersive gesture-based serious game that exploits the framework to enable MCI-diagnosed players to undertake therapeutic tasks supported by an assigned OT. Evaluation with OTs revealed that the immersive game potentially offers more effective support to MCI patients than traditional methods, contributing new possibilities for enhancing MCI rehabilitative training, while a comparative assessment of               MCI-GaTE               demonstrated that it provides a comprehensive approach not currently offered by state-of-the-art rehabilitative frameworks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence and robotics have increasingly~been adopted in agri-food systems\textemdash from milking robots to self-driving tractors. New projects extend these technologies in an effort to automate skilled work that has previously been considered dependent on human expertise due to its complexity. In this paper, we draw on qualitative research carried out with farm managers on apple orchards and winegrape vineyards in Aotearoa New Zealand. We investigate how agricultural managers' perceptions of future agricultural automation relates to their approach to expertise, or the degree to which they think specialised skills and knowledge are required to perform agricultural work~on their orchards and vineyards. Our research generates two insights: the perceived potential for work to be automated is related to the degree to which it is seen to require technical or embodied expertise, with technical expertise being more automatable; and, while embodied expertise is perceived to be more difficult to automate, it is sometimes~ attributed more exclusively to those in positions of power, such that embodied expertise can be highly valued while the majority of embodied~work is viewed as non-expert and thus~automatable. Our analysis illustrates that a robot can be an expert when expertise is technical. It also shows variability in the conceptualization of skilled or unskilled work, and that those conceptualizations can set the stage for the future effects of new technologies. This generates new insights into the conditions under which automation might reproduce existing inequalities in agriculture, and also raises new questions about responsibility in the context of automation.},

In order to achieve this, actions that mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) need to be identified. However, for the energy sector these actions are dispersed across the scientific literature, which is a clear barrier to encourage practitioners to have a proactive and pragmatic approach towards the SDGs. For this reason, a set of actions for energy projects was compiled. This compilation addresses the synergies and trade-offs identified in the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Assessment Framework for Energy Projects (SDG-IAE). One case of application was used to test the actions, the lighthouse Project VARGA. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted to understand how possible actions can impact different technologies, project stages, actors and SDG targets. In this way, enabling policymakers and project developers to define areas of action when evaluating policies or considering specific interventions. This article aims to be the starting point of stakeholder discussions that consistently frame energy projects within the achievement of the SDGs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Co-located collaboration on large vertical screens has become technically feasible, but users are faced with increased effort, or have to wear intrusive personal identifiers. Previous research on co-located collaboration has assumed that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during shared tasks (Fig.~1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig.~1b) and personal action windows (Fig.~1c) for co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task, which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users' behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along with personal action windows.},

From industrial processes to graphic design, the implementation of automated intelligent systems is changing how industries work. The spread of robots and AI systems has triggered academic institutions to closely examine how these technologies may affect the humanity\textemdash this is how the fields of roboethics and AI ethics have been born. The identification of ethical issues for robotics and AI and creation of ethical frameworks were the first steps to creating a regulatory environment for these technologies. In this paper, we focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America to create enforceable regulation for AI and robotics. We describe and compare ethical principles, policies, and regulations that have been proposed by government organizations for the design and use of robots and AI. We also discuss proposed international regulation for robotics and AI. This paper tries to highlight the need for a comprehensive, enforceable, and agile policy to ethically regulate technology today and in the future. Through reviewing existing policies, we conclude that the European Unition currently leads the way in defining roboethics and AI ethical principles and implementing them into policy. Our findings suggest that governments in Europe and North America are aware of the ethical risks that robotics and AI pose, and are engaged in policymaking to create regulatory policies for these new technologies.},

A centerpiece of the collaboration was to develop a near real-time database from clinical and operational data sources to inform healthcare decision making and research studies on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).                                         Methods               Our multidisciplinary team, including clinicians, epidemiologists, data scientists, medical informaticians and IT engineers, adopted the hybrid waterfall-agile project management methodology to develop the SingHealth COPD and Asthma Data Mart (SCDM). The SCDM was developed within the organizational data warehouse. It pulls and maps data from various information systems using extract, transform and load (ETL) pipelines. Robust user testing and data verification was also performed to ensure that the business requirements were met and that the ETL pipelines were valid.                                         Results               The SCDM includes 199 data elements relevant to asthma and COPD. Data verification was performed and found the SCDM to be reliable. As of December 31, 2019, the SCDM contained 36,407 unique patients with asthma and COPD across the spectrum from primary to tertiary care in our healthcare system. The database updates weekly to add new data of existing patients and to include new patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria.                                         Conclusions               The SCDM was systematically developed and tested to support the use RWD for clinical and health services research in asthma and COPD. This can serve as a platform to provide research and operational insights to improve the care delivered to our patients.},

By searching these three keywords in the Web of Science Core Collection among 4867 publications from 1990 to 2021, the number of publications in the past 5 years raised more than 50\%, which show significant research interest in architecture industry in recent years. Among them, the first two are static declarative knowledge representation methods, while the network-based knowledge representation method also includes procedural knowledge representation methods and provides a way for knowledge association. This means the network representation has more advantage in terms of the logical completeness of knowledge representation, and accounts for 67\% of the current research on knowledge representation in architecture. In the context of the rapid development of artificial intelligence, this method can realize the construction of architectural knowledge system and greatly improve the work efficiency of the building industry. On the other hand, in the face of carbon-neutral sustainable development scenarios, using knowledge representation, building performance knowledge and design knowledge could be expressed in a unified manner, and a personalized and efficient workflow for performance-oriented scheme design and optimization would be achieved.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The preponderance of Western methods, practices, standards, and classifications in the manner in which new technology-related knowledge is created and globalised has led to calls for more inclusive approaches to design. A decolonisation project is concerned with how researchers might contribute to dismantling and re-envisioning existing power relations, resisting past biases, and balancing Western heavy influences in technology design by foregrounding the authentic voices of the indigenous people in the entire design process. We examine how the establishment of local Global South HCI communities (AfriCHI and ArabHCI) has led to the enactment of decolonisation practices. Specifically, we seek to uncover how decolonisation is perceived in the AfriCHI and ArabHCI communities as well as the extent to which both communities are engaged with the idea of decolonisation without necessarily using the term. We drew from the relevant literature, our own outsider/insider lived experiences, and the communities' responses to an online anonymised survey to highlight three problematic but interrelated practical paradoxes: a terminology, an ethical, and a micro-colonisation paradox. We argue that these paradoxes expose the dilemmas faced by local non-Western researchers as they pursue decolonisation thinking. This article offers a blended perspective on the decolonisation debate in HCI, CSCW, and the practice-based CSCW scholarly communities and invites researchers to examine their research work using a decolonisation lens.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital technologies have been used to support mental health services for two decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic created a particular opportunity for greater utilization and more data-driven assessment of these digital technologies. This research aims to offer a scoping review of the characteristics and effectiveness of digital interventions that were employed to improve mental health in the real context of COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of search terms was applied for automatic search of publications in the relevant databases. The key features of included studies were extracted, including the intervention, participant, and study details. A total of 20 eligible studies were included in the final review, which were conducted across different geographic regions and among diverse cultural groups. Among them, fourteen studies mainly reported the impact of digital technologies on general population, while only one published study developed specific interventions for the isolated COVID-19 depressed patients in hospitals. Digital technologies identified in this review were mainly developed via web-based and mobile-based platforms, such as social networking and video conferencing applications. But less than half of them were aligned with theoretical approaches from standardized psychological treatments. Most of the studies have reported positive effects of digital technologies, either on improving general mental and emotional well-being or addressing specific conditions (e.g., depression, stress, and anxiety). This scoping review suggests that digital technologies hold promise in bridging the mental health-care gap during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and calls for more rigorous studies to identify pertinent features that are likely to achieve more effective mental health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Artificial intelligence in higher education is becoming more prevalent as it promises improvements and acceleration of administrative processes concerning student support, aiming for increasing student success and graduation rates. For instance, Academic Performance Prediction (APP) provides individual feedback and serves as the foundation for distributing student support measures. However, the use of APP with all its challenges (e.g., inherent biases) significantly impacts the future prospects of young adults. Therefore, it is important to weigh the opportunities and risks of such systems carefully and involve affected students in the development phase. This study addresses students' fairness perceptions of the distribution of support measures based on an APP system. First, we examine how students evaluate three different distributive justice norms, namely,               equality               ,               equity               , and               need               . Second, we investigate whether fairness perceptions differ between APP based on human or algorithmic decision-making, and third, we address whether evaluations differ between students studying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) or social sciences, humanities, and the arts for people and the economy (SHAPE), respectively. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with a 2                                                   \$\$\textbackslash times\$\$                                        \texttimes{}                                                                  3 factorial design among n = 1378 German students, in which we utilized the distinct distribution norms and decision-making agents as design factors. Our findings suggest that students prefer an equality-based distribution of support measures, and this preference is not influenced by whether APP is based on human or algorithmic decision-making. Moreover, the field of study does not influence the fairness perception, except that students of STEM subjects evaluate a distribution based on the need norm as more fair than students of SHAPE subjects. Based on these findings, higher education institutions should prioritize student-centric decisions when considering APP, weigh the actual need against potential risks, and establish continuous feedback through ongoing consultation with all stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Dahua Lou loom, pivotal to Nanjing Yunjin weaving, constitutes an integral part of global intangible cultural heritage. Its intricate weaving technique remains unmatched by modern machinery, marking it as a vital cultural artefact warranting protection. However, current virtual interactive systems grapple with adequately demonstrating its craftsmanship due to limitations like system iteration, multi-system integration, and data interoperability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method that synergizes knowledge ontology, virtual reality technology, and data-driven design.Knowledge ontology enables enhanced management, reuse, and wide-ranging dissemination of domain knowledge, improving system interoperability. This methodology is utilized in constructing the loom model, animation demonstration, and in integrating it into the virtual interactive system. This multifaceted application of knowledge ontology significantly bolsters the system's efficiency and optimizes its development, maintenance, and integration processes.This research provides crucial advancements in domain knowledge modeling, 3D visualization, and virtual reality interactive systems, playing a significant role in preserving cultural heritage. Despite certain limitations, it offers an immersive, intuitive, and enriched design experience. The study concludes with a critique of the developed system, discussions on the encountered challenges, and future research directions include improving and expanding the knowledge ontology based on the opinions and practical experiences of domain experts, enhancing system compatibility, and conducting broader evaluations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A regular supply of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to agriculture is needed for global food security, and increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural\textendash urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and capture some of its energetic value via biogas production. Anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, both energy and nutrient recovery can be achieved. Two promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from different types of wastewater are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. This review examined the effectiveness of these ecotechnologies for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment.                                         Methods               We searched for academic and grey literature published after 2013. Searches were performed in 5 bibliographic databases in English, in the search engine Google Scholar in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish, and across a range of organisational websites in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish. Eligibility screening was conducted at two levels: `title and abstract' and `full text'. Included eligible studies were subject to a critical appraisal that assessed external and internal study validity. We extracted information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis included narrative synthesis of each study of sufficient validity. We performed quantitative synthesis on a subset of studies.                                         Review findings                                The review included 30 studies on struvite precipitation and 8 studies on ammonia stripping. Both pH and Mg:PO                 4                 ~ratio were found to have a clear influence on the effectiveness of struvite precipitation process (and thus nutrient removal rates). The response to pH was found to be non-linear, resembling a bell curve with a maximum around pH 9.5. Mg:PO                 4                 ~ratio was found to have a positive effect on removal up to a ratio as high as 4:1. However, it should be noted that high removal efficiencies were sometimes achieved at a ratio as low as 1:1 as well. Although the effects of pH and Mg:PO                 4                 ~ratio were clear, the model developed could not accurately predict removal based on these two parameters alone. Studies on ammonia stripping were relatively heterogeneous. Due to the small size of the evidence base, and the heterogeneity between studies, no conclusions are presented regarding the influence of different process parameters on the outcome of ammonia stripping.                                                        Conclusions                                In conclusion, when performed under the right conditions (i.e. pH around 9.5 and Mg:PO                 4                 ratio of at least 1:1), available evidence suggests that struvite precipitation is an effective technology for the recovery of nutrients from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. The evidence base is limited for ammonia stripping. We provided suggestions of which data to report in future studies.},

The robot's behaviours and integration into the school were co-designed with the children and teachers, with a focus on improving the well-being of the pupils. Using a mix-method approach, we studied the robot's adoption over the course of the study, and the impact of the robot's presence on the children well-being and the school ecosystem. We found that the robot successfully integrated within the school; it fostered and maintained a steady level of interactions (330 interactions, 16~h of continuous use over 3~weeks) with a small yet meaningful group of children with a positive impact on their well-being; and it led to a nuanced conversation with the students and school staff about the role and impact of such a social technology in a SEN school.},

I argue that, amid the conflicting trends of `technological utopianism'\textemdash extreme faith in technological solutions; and `post-truth' politics\textemdash the populist pushback against the universality of science, the conditions for ethical knowledge production are significantly challenged. Drawing on insights gleaned from my work on political violence, law, and technology, I point to historical continuities in the way the application and pursuit of science relates to violence\textemdash especially state violence. Conscious of the fact that science exercises no restraint on violence\textemdash and indeed, may be put to work for violent purposes\textemdash the paper calls for more attention to the social, structural, and political conditions of scientific production. The final part of this essay, therefore, examines three developments challenging the ethical capacity of scholars and scientists today. These are (1) the bureaucratization of ethics (2), `ethics~washing,' and (3) co-optation. Like other policy domains in our society, informed normative assessments around scientific pursuits\textemdash value judgments and ethical evaluation\textemdash ought to be based on sound empirical knowledge of the contingencies of science.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate to local contexts. Many incumbent `tools of the trade' are proprietary and were developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques\textemdash such as route analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation\textemdash have great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist, challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse and rapidly evolving `ecosystem' tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid `reinventing the wheel' and focus on innovation, the `gamified' A/B Street               https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/\#abstreet               simulation software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The paper, the source code of which can be found at               https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat               , concludes that, although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Health behaviors before, during and after pregnancy can have lasting effects on maternal and infant health outcomes. Although digital health interventions (DHIs) have potential as a pertinent avenue to deliver mechanisms for a healthy behavior change, its success is reliant on addressing the user needs. Accordingly, the current study aimed to understand DHI needs and expectations of women before, during and after pregnancy to inform and optimize future DHI developments. Forty-four women (13 pre-, 16 during and 15 postpregnancy; age range = 21\textendash 40 years) completed a 60-minute, semistructured, qualitative interview exploring participant's experience in their current phase, experience with digital health tools, and their needs and expectations of DHIs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. From the interviews, two core concepts emerged\textemdash personalization and localization of DHI. Between both concepts, five themes and nine subthemes were identified. Themes and subthemes within personalization cover ideas of two-way interactivity, journey organization based on phases and circumstances, and privacy trade-off. Themes and subthemes within localization cover ideas of access to local health-related resources and information, and connecting to local communities through anecdotal stories. Here we report, through understanding user needs and expectations, the key elements for the development and optimization of a successful DHI for women before, during and after pregnancy. To potentially empower downstream DHI implementation and adoption, these insights can serve as a foundation in the initial innovation process for DHI developers and be further built upon through a continued co-design process.},

Stroke frequently affects motor control of the arm, leading to diffculties in doing activities of daily living. This research focuses on developing an upper limb rehabilitation robotic prototype through user-centered design to aid stroke survivors in rehabilitating their arm. To gather requirements from end users, stroke therapy sessions were observed and a survey of stroke therapists was conducted. End user requirements were evaluated to determine technical targets for the mechanical design of the prototype. Evaluation of the prototype was done with stroke therapists in a focus group and a preliminary biomechanical study. As user-centered design would require more iterations of design, testing and evaluation, this project reports a first step in developing an affordable, portable device, which could increase access to stroke rehabilitation for the arm.},

However, architects have difficulty capturing the complex, multidimensional, and unpredictable behavior of humans, often struggle to get users' feedback on time in the schematic phase. This paper proposes a new virtual reality-based behavioral measurement and assessment tool that quantitatively collects and analyzes individual behavioral data, including travel trajectory, travel time, and gaze points, to reveal user experience and interaction of light, aiming to better help architects get timely feedback from users and create human-centered indoor light environment designs in the scheme optimization phase. To showcase this tool, we utilize an exhibition hall of a museum design as an illustrative example. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed tool, and its results suggest that different lighting schemes influence human behavior patterns and that the introduction of natural light usually stimulates more movement. The developed virtual reality tool prototype provides valuable visual information and statistics for analyzing human behavior and evaluating indoor light environment design schemes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many object detection tasks. However, such DNNS-based large object detection models are generally computationally expensive and memory intensive. It is difficult to deploy them to devices with low memory resources or scenarios with high real-time requirements, which greatly limits their application and promotion. In recent years, many researchers have focused on compressing large object detection models without significantly degrading their performance, and have made great progress. Therefore, this paper presents a survey of object detection model compression techniques in recent years. Firstly, these compression techniques were divided into six categories: network pruning, lightweight network design, neural architecture search (NAS), low-rank decomposition, network quantization, and Knowledge distillation (KD) methods. For each category, we select some representative state-of-the-art methods and compare and analyze their performance on public datasets. After that, we discuss the application scenarios and future directions of model compression techniques. Finally, this paper is further concluded by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of six types of model compression techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The use of agile methodology has become widespread in organizations that previously relied on traditional or structured software development methods, such as the waterfall approach. Successful completion rates for agile initiatives are at 40\%, whereas only 15\% of waterfall projects were successfully completed. To take advantage of the benefits of each method, many organizations are using a hybrid approach that combines Agile with Waterfall and structured software development methodologies. Rather than asking which methodology is superior, it is more productive to determine which one is most effective for a particular project. Agile projects have a failure rate of 10\%, while waterfall projects fail 30\% of the time. This study aims to compare and contrast agile and waterfall methodologies in order to create a decision tree for selecting the most suitable method for a software development project. Several cases and scenarios are examined using the hybrid development approach. Despite many advantages of Agile methodologies, a combination approach may be necessary, as Waterfall may be required for certain projects or development phases. This study explores the feasibility of combining Waterfall and Agile methodologies in software development management.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There has been an increased focus within the AI ethics literature on questions of power, reflected in the ideal of accountability supported by many Responsible AI guidelines. While this recent debate points towards the power asymmetry between those who shape AI systems and those affected by them, the literature lacks normative grounding and misses conceptual clarity on how these power dynamics take shape. In this paper, I develop a workable conceptualization of said power dynamics according to Cristiano Castelfranchi's conceptual framework of power and argue that end-users depend on a system's developers and users, because end-users rely on these systems to satisfy their goals, constituting a power asymmetry between developers, users and end-users. I ground my analysis in the neo-republican moral wrong of domination, drawing attention to legitimacy concerns of the power-dependence relation following from the current lack of accountability mechanisms. I illustrate my claims on the basis of a risk-prediction machine learning system, and propose institutional (external auditing) and project-specific solutions (increase contestability through design-for-values approaches) to mitigate domination.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Field trips enrich learning programs with out-of-school activities that can bring gains in students' academic content knowledge and personal growth. However, they are a source of anxiety for teachers because of the bureaucracy, pedagogy, etc., risks they imply. To address this issue, we propose FieldTripOrganizer, a field trip planner based on the mixed-initiative approach aimed at increasing teachers' autonomy and motivation in designing educational tours. The key aspects of our application are (i) the simultaneous provision of information filtering and automated scheduling support while the user designs the field trip, and (ii) the visual annotation of places and activities to show whether they can be included in the itinerary without violating its time constraints. Different from current tour planners, these functions enable the user to be in full control of the design process, delegating the system to manage difficult and burdensome tasks such as consistency checks and itinerary optimization. We evaluated FieldTripOrganizer in the use case of organizing a science field trip. In a preliminary user study involving 18 science teachers, our application turned up to be superior to a baseline tour planner in both usability and user experience. Moreover, the teachers declared that it was helpful, motivated them, and reduced their anxiety during the design of the field trips.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Current depictions of autonomous vehicle (AV) futures are produced primarily by automobile manufacturers that largely reflect and reinforce existing sociotechnical systems in a `business as usual' model that frames this technology within a narrative of crisis and technological salvation. This article argues for a more complex analysis of AV futures in which images are understood as vessels for sociotechnical imaginaries that direct and delimit what we think is possible in the future. Through an analytical framework incorporating automobility, transitions, and imaginaries, I explore how depictions of AVs frame the technology as responding to various system pressures over time through a comparative analysis of two actors. The analysis suggests that regime actors deploy visual discursive material as a tool of regime stability or change to benefit their own agendas. The intention of the article is not to anticipate current trajectories but is a methodological exploration of how policymakers and planners can interpret AV visualisations. Therefore, the paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these imaginaries for future transportation systems. It further suggests that policymakers and planners need to take a more active role in the development of AV futures by paying much more attention to the latent meanings behind AV visualisations and working collaboratively with those who produce them.},

So-called care robots are presented as a solution to the nursing crisis, despite doubts about their technological readiness and the lack of concrete usage scenarios in everyday nursing practice. We inquire into this interconnection of social robotics and care. We show how both are made available for each other in three arenas: innovation policy, care organization, and robotic engineering. First, we analyze the discursive ``logics'' of care robotics within European innovation policy, second, we disclose how care robotics is encountering a historically grown conflict within health care organization, and third we show how care scenarios are being used in robotic engineering. From this diagnosis, we derive a threefold critique of robotics in healthcare, which calls attention to the politics, historicity, and social situatedness of care robotics in elderly care.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Systematic conservation planning is a discipline concerned with the prioritisation of resources for biodiversity conservation and is often used in the design or assessment of terrestrial and marine protected area networks. Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe?                                         Methods               A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context.                                         Results               Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), R\'eunion Island, and The Nature Conservancy's landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios.                                         Conclusion               Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes. Adequate reporting of outcomes will in turn enable transparency and accountability between institutions and funding bodies as well as improving the science and practice of conservation planning.},

However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles\textemdash the `what' of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)\textemdash rather than on practices, the `how.' Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community's ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.},

Several types of research examined if virtual reality can be an effective solution.~This paper aims to present the cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analysing, and refining the VR system in real-world clinical settings. Seven people with~moderate to severe dementia were recruited. The experiment required the patients to attend three virtual reality iterations of rapid prototyping with user testing. All three iterations involved training activities with upper body movements similar to their usual physical training. A mixed-methods design measured affect and emotional behaviour using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale and the Visual Analog Scale. Content analysis was conducted following observations and interviews. During each iteration of rapid prototyping with user testing, quantitative measurements of performance, independence and time were recorded. Eye tracking and movement information were captured by the system. Finally, a simplified version of the presence and usability scales evaluated~the system. The results of this study provide further evidence that virtual reality can play a significant role in the improvement of people's~with dementia physical training and emotional health when is appropriately designed. The results present the vital factors which should~be~incorporated in a virtual reality system which are: 1) a simple interactions modality; 2) visible visual targets and continuous feedback; 3) personalized virtual environments; 4) personalized range of movements.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A common practice in scenarios of remote collaboration is to provide a representation from distributed team members, aiming to positively influence the level of social presence and in turn the work effort. Nevertheless, these stimuli can lead to fractured learning experiences, since collaborators need to split attention among the task, the shared information, and the counterpart representation. This paper explored how the last affects social presence, and other dimensions of collaboration, as well as task resolution in scenarios of remote guidance. A user study was conducted, comparing two distinct conditions: traditional video chat (team members representation always visible) and Augmented Reality (AR) annotations (collaborators representation never available). These were selected due to ongoing research with partners from the industry sector, following the insights of a participatory design process. A real-life use-case was considered, i.e., synchronous maintenance task with 4 completion stages that required a remote expert using a computer to guide 37 on-site participants wielding a handheld device. The results of the study are described and discussed based on data analysis, showing that the majority of participants preferred the AR-based condition, despite the absence of the expert representation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Supply chain management has become increasingly complex, leading to information loss and delayed transmission, exacerbating the bullwhip effect. Furthermore, the need for more reliable information storage, traceability, and accountability has slowed supply chain management. In this context, blockchain technology (BCT) solves the bullwhip effect problem, as it supports distributed networking, information synchronization among nodes, digital encryption, traceable information, and unchangeable block content. This paper proposes using public blockchain to solve the bullwhip effect problem in the supply chain (SC), which has yet to be discussed in published academic research papers. To this end, a framework has been developed to determine the readiness of a supply chain for blockchain adoption. This framework includes a checklist to evaluate the motivation, timing, and appropriate platform for adopting blockchain. The framework has been validated using a case study of personal computer devices, which were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and resulted in semiconductors supply chain disruption. The study involved polling four executives The study involved polling four executives (of large organizations in Egypt and some Middle Eastern countries)~representing different stages in the supply chain, they are~retail, distribution, manufacturing, and supply. The results showed that while the executives recognized the benefits of adopting blockchain, they were still determining if it was the right time for adoption and did not see the technology ready for their supply chains. Finally, some public blockchain platforms were introduced to help businesses choose the most suitable platform for adoption.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This research explores current strategies and approaches directed to integrate innovative technologies in the home modification process to support independent living and ageing in place. The systematic review considered studies conducted from the perspective of architecture, smart technology, and gerontology. Scientific databases of related disciplines (e.g. Scopus, Web of Science, Engineer village, Google Scholar, Crossref) were searched and supplemented by hand search method. Thirty-three out of 2594 articles were analysed from three perspectives: the framework of the smart home environment for ageing in place, the smart home modification process, and problems and countermeasures of independent living. The result shows that both home modification and smart technologies can support older adults' independent living, especially with fall prevention and indoor accessibility. Technologies deployed in older adults' homes are transiting from manual assistive technology to more intelligent devices, and the notion of the robotic home has emerged. According to existing practices, universal design is an extensively adopted strategy for smart home design and modification. However, in most cases, universal design is used as a retrofitting guideline for general home settings rather than specifically for smart homes. The fundamental requirements in smart home modification phases are customisation, minimum life interference, and extensible technologies to cope with the ageing process.},

Those working in nanotechnology risk management have been prolific in creating such tools, many derived from European FP7 and H2020-funded projects. What is less clear is how such tools might assist the overarching ambition of creating a fair system of risk governance. In this paper, we reflect upon the role that tools might and should play in any system of risk governance. With many tools designed for the risk governance of this emerging technology falling into disuse, this paper provides an overview of extant tools and addresses their potential shortcomings. We also posit the need for a data readiness tool. With the EUs NMP13 family of research consortia about to report to the Commission on ways forward in terms of risk governance of this domain, this is a timely intervention on an important element of any risk governance system.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sustainable finance and climate change have emerged as areas of renewed interest in the wake of the global financial crisis, when the assessment of companies' risk management was shown to be the key to the prevention of systemic disruption. While many aspects of corporate disclosures were radically and quickly revised following the crisis, even several years later commentators have pointed to a continuing pressure for improvement to regulatory requirements in relation to financial statements. Much of the debate focuses on the need for expedited operational execution of reporting information. Over the past decade significant advances have taken place in digital technologies, especially with respect to the security and processing of granular data. This article examines how these new technologies can be deployed in a manner that will address the need to eliminate the vulnerabilities of the climate risk management process, which requires standardisation of data in order to improve managerial decision-making and the desired outcomes. It further explores the use of technology to enhance the evaluation of climate change impact on company exposures, and to advance transparency in regulatory reporting for financial institutions. Technology applications such as automated language systems offer opportunities to align corporate disclosure with climate change policy objectives, which in turn can increase sustainability in the performance of companies' activities.},

Despite research that addresses varying aspects of moral decision-making based upon algorithms, the definition of project success is less clear. Nevertheless, researchers place the burden of responsibility for ethical decisions on the developers of AI systems. This study used a systematic literature review to identify five categories of AI project success factors in 17 groups related to moral decision-making with algorithms. It translates AI ethical principles into practical project deliverables and actions that underpin the success of AI projects. It considers success over time by investigating the development, usage, and consequences of moral decision-making by algorithmic systems. Moreover, the review reveals and defines AI success factors within the project management literature. Project managers and sponsors can use the results during project planning and execution.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The regular addition of plant-available nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, either as manufactured fertilisers or animal manure, to agricultural soils is needed for global food security. Increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural\textendash urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and also capture its energetic value via biogas production. The liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. Two such promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from e.g. wastewater and thereby contribute to environmental amelioration are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, a treatment process that provides both renewable energy and plant nutrients is achieved. This review will examine the effectiveness of ecotechnologies for the recovery and reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment.                                         Methods               We will search for both academic and grey literature published after 2013. English language searches will be performed in 4 bibliographic databases, and Google Scholar, while searches in 41 specialist websites will be performed in English, Finnish, Polish and Swedish. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and abstract and full text. Included eligible studies will be subject to a critical appraisal that will assess external and internal study validity. We will extract information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis will involve narrative synthesis of each included study of sufficient validity. Quantitative synthesis (i.e. meta-analysis) may be possible in cases where a sufficient number of studies report similar types of outcomes.},

The study emphasises on the complexity theory of fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), to establish a result-driven definition of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) during and post pandemics. The results of this study revealed that a combination of conditions derived from pandemic policy related reforms and I5.0 enablers will assist manufacturers and suppliers in establishing food safety and security during and post the COVID-19 era in a developing economy. Food safety and security being the goal, based on a survey of 140 food companies, this study provides insights to manufacturers and policymakers to enable selective implementation of I5.0 enabling technologies and pandemic policies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This systematic review aims to synthesize how agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used in migration and modern slavery research and provide the basis to model development for social science researchers exploring the use of ABM. We searched five bibliographic databases using two terminology categories: (1) migration or modern slavery terminology; (2) complex system methods terminology. Two reviewers conducted independent article screening. Peer-reviewed articles presenting original migration or modern slavery ABMs were included. Data extraction included model development steps and model characteristics. The dataset was synthesized and compared across studies. We identified 28 articles for inclusion. Many of the ABMs tested theories and about half were based on empirical data. Model development varied considerably and reported methods were extremely opaque. Only five studies used a structured development framework. The most common model involved agents deciding whether and where to migrate and attempting migration. Climate change was a common exogenous scenario modeled. Most of the ABMs did not undergo any sensitivity analysis or validation.ABM has a greater capacity to account for heterogeneous and dynamic decision-making than more frequently applied methods in research on migration and modern slavery. However, there is still a paucity of studies adopting ABM methods. These reviewed ABMs highlight gaps in the reporting and implementing of model development. ABM is a promising technique to address many urgent and complex questions in research on migration and modern slavery to better support decision-makers, but addressing current methodological gaps is a critical first step.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Skeletal spatial structure (SkS) systems are modular systems which have shown promise to support mass customization, and sustainability in construction. SkS have been used extensively in the reconstruction efforts since World War II, particularly to build geometrically flexible and free-form structures. By employing advanced digital engineering and construction practices, the existing SkS designs may be repurposed to generate new optimal designs that satisfy current construction demands of contemporary societies. To this end, this study investigated the application of point cloud processing using the Field Information Modeling (FIM) framework for the digital documentation and generative redesign of existing SkS systems. Three new algorithms were proposed to (i) expand FIM to include generative decision-support; (ii) generate as-built building information modeling (BIM) for SkS; and (iii) modularize SkS designs with repeating patterns for optimal production and supply chain management. These algorithms incorporated a host of new AI-inspired methods, including support vector machine (SVM) for decision support; Bayesian optimization for neighborhood definition; Bayesian Gaussian mixture clustering for modularization; and Monte Carlo stochastic multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for selection of the top Pareto front solutions obtained by the non-dominant sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II). The algorithms were tested and validated on four real-world point cloud datasets to solve two generative modeling problems, namely, engineering design optimization and facility location optimization. It was observed that the proposed Bayesian neighborhood definition outperformed particle swarm and uniform sampling by 34\% and 27\%, respectively. The proposed SVM-based linear feature detection outperformed k-means and spectral clustering by 56\% and 9\%, respectively. Finally, the NSGA II algorithm combined with the stochastic MCDM produced diverse ``top four'' solutions based on project-specific criteria. The results indicate promise for future utilization of the framework to produce training datasets for generative adversarial networks that generate new designs based only on stakeholder requirements.},

This means that ethical principles, such as fairness, need to be translated into practicable AI governance processes. A concise AI governance definition would allow researchers and practitioners to identify the constituent parts of the complex problem of translating AI ethics into practice. However, there have been few efforts to define AI governance thus far. To bridge this gap, this paper defines AI governance at the organizational level. Moreover, we delineate how AI governance enters into a governance landscape with numerous governance areas, such as corporate governance, information technology (IT) governance, and data governance. Therefore, we position AI governance as part of an organization's governance structure in relation to these existing governance areas. Our definition and positioning of organizational AI governance paves the way for crafting AI governance frameworks and offers a stepping stone on the pathway toward governed AI.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The World Health Organization report that an estimated 793,000 people died by suicide in 2016 globally. The use of digital technology has been found to be beneficial in the delivery of Web-based suicide prevention interventions. Research on the integration of digital technology within mental health services has indicated that despite the proliferation of technology, engagement by patients and professionals in adopting such technology can be poor.                                         Objectives               The current study aims to explore the experiences of 15 mental health professionals involved in integrating mobile health technology into their practice. A secondary aim was to identify the drivers and barriers to the adoption of such technology by mental health professionals, and to consider what theoretical models could best account for the data.                                         Methods               Semi-structured interviews, conducted from July to October 2019, were used to explore the experiences of mental health professionals engaged in the adoption of mobile health technology within mental health services. Mental Health professionals and clinician managers working in HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Adult Mental Health, and Primary Care Psychology services were recruited for the study. Qualitative interview data was transcribed and analysed using NVivo. Thematic Analysis was used to identify themes.                                         Results               Four major themes were identified: Accessibility, `Transitional Object', Integration, and Trust. Within these 4 major themes, a total of 9 subthemes were identified: Service Accessibility, Immediate Access, Client Engagement, Adjunct-to-therapy, Therapeutic Relationship, Infrastructural Support, Enhancing Treatment, Trust in the Technology, Trust in the Organisation.                                         Conclusions               Overall, Diffusion of Innovation Theory provides a useful theoretical framework which is consistent with and can adequately account for many of the Major and Subthemes identified in the data. In addition, `Transitional Objects', a key concept within Object Relations Theory, could offer a means of better understanding how patients and professionals engage with digital technology within mental health services particularly.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Smartwatches have become increasingly popular in recent times because of their capacity to track different health indicators, including heart rate, patterns of sleep, and physical movements. This scoping review aims to explore the utilisation of smartwatches within the healthcare sector. According to Arksey and O'Malley's methodology, an organised search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. In our search strategy, 761 articles were returned. The exclusion/inclusion criteria were applied. Finally, 35 articles were selected for extracting data. These included six studies on stress monitoring, six on movement disorders, three on sleep tracking, three on blood pressure, two on heart disease, six on covid pandemic, three on safety and six on validation. The use of smartwatches has been found to be effective in diagnosing the symptoms of various diseases. In particular, smartwatches have shown promise in detecting heart diseases, movement disorders, and even early signs of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that there is an ongoing discussion concerning the reliability of smartwatch diagnoses within healthcare systems. Despite the potential advantages offered by utilising smartwatches for disease detection, it is imperative to approach their data interpretation with prudence. The discrepancies in detection between smartwatches and their algorithms have important implications for healthcare use. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithms used are crucial, as well as high accuracy in detecting changes in health status by the smartwatches themselves. This calls for the development of medical watches and the creation of AI-hospital assistants. These assistants will be designed to help with patient monitoring, appointment scheduling, and medication management tasks. They can educate patients and answer common questions, freeing healthcare providers to focus on more complex tasks.},

This review article, which doubles as an editorial to Digital Society's topical collection on `Auditing of AI', provides an overview of previous work in the field. Three key points emerge from the review. First, contemporary attempts to audit AI systems have much to learn from how audits have historically been structured and conducted in areas like financial accounting, safety engineering and the social sciences. Second, both policymakers and technology providers have an interest in promoting auditing as an AI governance mechanism. Academic researchers can thus fill an important role by studying the feasibility and effectiveness of different AI auditing procedures. Third, AI auditing is an inherently multidisciplinary undertaking, to which substantial contributions have been made by computer scientists and engineers as well as social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and industry practitioners. Reflecting this diversity of perspectives, different approaches to AI auditing have different affordances and constraints. Specifically, a distinction can be made between technology-oriented audits, which focus on the properties and capabilities of AI systems, and process-oriented audits, which focus on technology providers' governance structures and quality management systems. The next step in the evolution of auditing as an AI governance mechanism, this article concludes, should be the interlinking of these available\textemdash and complementary\textemdash approaches into structured and holistic procedures to audit not only how AI systems are designed and used but also how they impact users, societies and the natural environment in applied settings over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In an earlier paper from 2019, this author concluded that successful eradication of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) from Ireland by 2030 would be unlikely, given control strategies in place at that time plus the addition of badger vaccination. He argued that additional measures will be needed, broadly focusing on bTB risks from wildlife, risk-based cattle controls, and industry commitment. This paper considers these points in further detail.                                         Main text               Ongoing monitoring of the badger vaccination programme (which is progressively being rolled out nationally) and associated research will be critical, with a focus both on programme inputs and outcomes. The direct contribution of cattle movements to bTB restrictions in Ireland~has been evaluated.~However,~it is the indirect role of cattle movements in~bTB restrictions~that is likely of greater importance, particularly towards the latter phase of the eradication programme.~In other national programmes, a range of risk-based approaches have been used to address the challenge of residual infection in cattle (that is, the presence of animals with persistent but undetected infection), and similar approaches are needed in Ireland. A number of authors have highlighted the critical importance of industry commitment to programme success, and the key role of programme governance to achieving this. In this commentary, the author briefly considers experiences from Australia and New Zealand in this regard. The author also reflects on the challenge of uncertainty in decision-making, the relevance to Ireland of lessons from other countries, and the potential contribution of new methodologies in support of the national programme.                                         Conclusions               `The tragedy of the horizon' was a term first used in the context of climate change, referring to the costs imposed on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentives to fix. This concept is equally relevant to bTB eradication in Ireland, where current decisions will have long-term consequences for future generations, including both the general public (through the Exchequer) and future Irish farmers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Today's complex problems call for multidisciplinary analytics teams comprising of both analytics and non-technical domain (i.e. subject matter) experts. Recognizing the difference between data visualisaion (DV) (i.e. static visual outputs) and visual analytics (VA) (i.e. a process of interactive visual data exploration, guided by user's domain and contextual knowledge), this paper focuses on VA for non-technical domain experts. By seeking to understand knowledge sharing from VA experts to non-technical users of VA in a multidisciplinary team, we aim to explore how these domain experts learn to use VA as a thinking tool, guided by their knowing-in-practice. The research described in this paper was conducted in the context of a long-term industry-wide research project called the `Visual Historical Atlas of the Australian Co-operatives', led by a multidisciplinary VA team who faced the challenge tackled by this research. Using Action Design Research (ADR) and the combined theoretical lens of boundary objects and secondary design, the paper theorises a three-phase method for knowledge transfer, translation and transformation from VA experts to domain experts using different types of VA-related boundary objects. Together with the proposed set of design principles, the three-phase model advances the well-established stream of research on organizational use of analytics, extending it to the emerging area of visual analytics for non-technical decision makers.},

There are multiple initiatives and previous works that advocate user involvement from the beginning of the project; however, in this work, we go a step further by presenting a model for designing and constructing software applications (RiD\textemdash Responsive inclusive Design) defined for inclusive software. RiD extends the involvement of the user with disabilities to the entire software life cycle, in different roles, and taking into account the changing nature of the user profile in the evolution of the product. This article also presents the EDICO case study, an accessible and inclusive scientific editor for the Spanish National Organization of the Blind (ONCE), which was successfully implemented applying the RiD principles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Responsible Business Model Innovation is increasingly becoming a relevant challenge in academic research and business practice, mainly in the Asian context. Changes in business models are widely acknowledged as a key strategy for achieving long-term innovation. However, little is known about the design journey of Responsible Business Model Innovation. By applying the knowledge-based view and stakeholder theory, this paper introduces the founding pillars of Responsible Business Model Innovation, namely: Corporate Social Responsiveness, Inclusiveness, and Reflective Knowledge Exchange. Based on the analysis of extended bodies of literature published between 2011 and 2021 on business model innovation, sustainability innovation, stakeholder theory and responsible innovation, the article explores the state of the art of business ethics and dynamic capabilities in Asian organizations. Findings show that recent research in the field of sustainability and ethical values are improving the impact on business models, thus encouraging the advent of Responsible Business Model Innovation. This article contributes to the emerging field of responsible innovation and offers novel theoretical and practical implications for academy and practitioners, including a first attempt to develop a road map to be followed to achieve of sustainable and ethical values for business and society at large.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Usability is considered a~major success factor for current and future decision support systems. Such systems are increasingly used to assist human decision-makers in high-stakes tasks in complex domains such as health care, jurisdiction or finance. Yet, many if not most expert systems\textemdash especially in health care\textemdash fail to deliver the degree of quality in terms of usability that its expert users are used to from their personal digital consumer products. In this article, we focus on clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an example for how important a~human-centered design approach is when designing complex software in complex contexts. We provide an overview of CDSS classes, discuss the importance of systematically exploring mental models of users, and formulate challenges and opportunities of future design work on CDSS. We further provide a~case study from a~current research project to illustrate how we used codesign as a~practical approach to produce usable software in a~real-world context.                            Practical Relevance               : We make a~point for usability to be considered a~major success factor and non-negotiable characteristic of expert software. With software evolving into virtual coworkers in terms of supporting human decision-making in complex, high-risk domains, the necessity of and demand for systems that are unambiguously understandable and interpretable for their expert users have never been higher. We show that this is a~real-world problem with high practical relevance by describing our work in the domain of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an example. We introduce the topic and a~classification of CDSS. Thus, we highlight a~conceptual framework of how to approach complex domains from a~technology designer's point of view. We continue by explaining why usability must be regarded as a~major goal in software development. We derive challenges and opportunities that may well be transferred to other domains. Finally, be including a~real-world example from our own professional work we propose a~practical approach towards taking the challenges and exploiting the associated opportunities.                        ,              Zusammenfassung             Die Benutzerfreundlichkeit gilt als ein wichtiger Erfolgsfaktor f\"ur aktuelle und zuk\"unftige Entscheidungsunterst\"utzungssysteme. Solche Systeme werden zunehmend eingesetzt, um menschliche Entscheidungstr\"ager bei anspruchsvollen Aufgaben in komplexen Bereichen wie dem Gesundheitswesen, der Rechtsprechung oder dem Finanzwesen zu unterst\"utzen. Viele, wenn nicht sogar die meisten Expertensysteme \textendash ~insbesondere im Gesundheitswesen~\textendash{} bieten jedoch nicht die Qualit\"at in Bezug auf die Benutzerfreundlichkeit, die die Experten von ihren pers\"onlichen digitalen Konsumg\"utern gewohnt sind. In diesem Artikel konzentrieren wir uns auf klinische Entscheidungsunterst\"utzungssysteme (CDSS) als Beispiel daf\"ur, wie wichtig ein menschenzentrierter Designansatz bei der Entwicklung komplexer Software in komplexen Kontexten ist. Wir geben einen \"Uberblick \"uber CDSS-Klassen, er\"ortern die Bedeutung der systematischen Erforschung mentaler Modelle von Nutzern und formulieren Herausforderungen und Chancen f\"ur die zuk\"unftige Designarbeit an CDSS. Dar\"uber hinaus stellen wir eine Fallstudie aus einem aktuellen Forschungsprojekt vor, um zu veranschaulichen, wie wir Codesign als praktischen Ansatz eingesetzt haben, um brauchbare Software in einem realen Kontext zu entwickeln.                            Praktische Relevanz               : Wir setzen uns daf\"ur ein, dass die Benutzerfreundlichkeit als ein wichtiger Erfolgsfaktor und nicht verhandelbares Merkmal von Expertensoftware angesehen wird. Mit der Entwicklung von Software zu virtuellen Mitarbeitern, die den Menschen bei der Entscheidungsfindung in komplexen, risikoreichen Bereichen unterst\"utzen, sind die Notwendigkeit und die Nachfrage nach Systemen, die f\"ur ihre Expertenanwender eindeutig verst\"andlich und interpretierbar sind, so hoch wie nie zuvor. Wir zeigen, dass dies ein reales Problem mit hoher praktischer Relevanz ist, indem wir unsere Arbeit im Bereich der klinischen Entscheidungsunterst\"utzungssysteme (CDSS) als Beispiel beschreiben. Wir stellen das Thema und eine Klassifizierung von CDSS vor. So zeigen wir einen konzeptionellen Rahmen auf, wie man sich komplexen Dom\"anen aus der Sicht eines Technologieentwicklers n\"ahert. Wir fahren fort, indem wir erkl\"aren, warum die Benutzerfreundlichkeit als ein Hauptziel bei der Softwareentwicklung angesehen werden muss. Daraus leiten wir Herausforderungen und M\"oglichkeiten ab, die sich durchaus auf andere Bereiche \"ubertragen lassen. Schlie\ss lich schlagen wir anhand eines praktischen Beispiels aus unserer eigenen beruflichen T\"atigkeit einen praktischen Ansatz vor, um die Herausforderungen anzunehmen und die damit verbundenen Chancen zu nutzen.},

A transition towards more sustainable consumption is needed. Targeted public policy interventions are crucial for stimulating such transition. While there is extensive research about the promotion of more environmentally sustainable food consumption, this knowledge is scattered across different sources. This systematic map aims to collate and describe the available evidence on public policy interventions such as laws, directives, taxes and information campaigns, for achieving sustainable food consumption patterns.                                         Methods               We will search bibliographic databases, specialist websites, Google Scholar and bibliographies of relevant reviews. Searches for academic literature will be performed in English, while searches for grey literature will be performed in English, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. Screening, including consistency checking exercises, will be done at two levels: title and abstract, and full text. We will use machine learning algorithms to support screening at the title and abstract level. Coding and meta-data extraction will include bibliographic information, policy details and context, and measured environmental outcome(s). The evidence base will be summarised narratively using tables and graphs and presented as an online interactive searchable database and a website that will allow for visualisation, filtering and exploring systematic map findings, knowledge gaps and clusters.},

Through the comparison between two different approaches to collaborative application design (namely, user-centered vs participatory), we reveal how sensitivity to the role that users may play during that collaborative practice rebounds to a good level of user satisfaction during the evaluation process. Our paper also contributes to conversations and reflections on the differences between those two design approaches, while providing evidences that the participatory approach may better sensitize designers to issues of users' satisfaction. We finally offer our study as a resource and a methodology for recognizing and understanding the role of active users during a process of development of a software application.},

Despite performance gains and hype, uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindered by these concerns. Explainable AI is thought to help alleviate these concerns. However, existing definitions for                 explainable                 are not forming a solid foundation for this work.                                                        Methods                                We critique recent reviews on the literature regarding: the agency of an AI within a team; mental models, especially as they apply to healthcare, and the practical aspects of their elicitation; and existing and current definitions of explainability, especially from the perspective of AI researchers. On the basis of this literature, we create a new definition of                 explainable                 , and supporting terms, providing definitions that can be objectively evaluated. Finally, we apply the new definition of explainable to three existing models, demonstrating how it can apply to previous research, and providing guidance for future research on the basis of this definition.                                                        Results                                Existing definitions of explanation are premised on global applicability and don't address the question `understandable                 by whom                 ?'. Eliciting mental models can be likened to creating explainable AI if one considers the AI as a member of a team. On this basis, we define explainability in terms of the                 context                 of the model, comprising the                 purpose                 ,                 audience                 , and                 language                 of the model and explanation. As examples, this definition is applied to regression models, neural nets, and human mental models in operating-room teams.                                                        Conclusions               Existing definitions of explanation have limitations for ensuring that the concerns for practical applications are resolved. Defining explainability in terms of the context of their application forces evaluations to be aligned with the practical goals of the model. Further, it will allow researchers to explicitly distinguish between explanations for technical and lay audiences, allowing different evaluations to be applied to each.},

FLR aims to enhance ecological integrity and improve human well-being within (forested) landscapes. The monitoring of FLR is essential to ensure effective implementation and to learn from practice. Yet to this day, monitoring remains a major challenge for FLR. Monitoring FLR requires measures at a landscape scale and across social and natural sciences. We explore some of the monitoring challenges raised by these dimensions of FLR. We assess the current theory and practice behind FLR monitoring and how it relates to practices in related environmental disciplines.                                         Recent Findings               We highlight the challenges raised by the recent attempts at monitoring FLR and explore lessons from other related fields and conclude by proposing a framework of the basic issues to consider when monitoring FLR.

  abstract = {Abstract             Future construction projects will need the implementation of industry 4.0 and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. The construction sector has, however, falling behind other industries in the application of these technologies and is currently facing considerable challenges. One of the industries that lag behind in the use of new innovative technological tools is the construction industry. This study reviews the research work in industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things as they relate to construction and examines key Ghana-based construction professionals and firms to ascertain their level of understanding of these emerging innovative technologies, including the challenges and benefits associated with their implementation. An extensive review of pertinent literature was done to help identify the important paradigms and variables which were cautiously tested. Adopting a quantitative research approach, the attained variables were used to design into a close-ended questionnaire. The sample frame was a survey of people from 154 construction experts and researchers with good standing by using the purposive sampling. Relative importance index (RII) analysis was used to analyzed the data. It was discovered from the findings that smart construction was the most popular industry 4.0 technology in the Ghanaian construction industry. The most important benefit of these technologies is that they will add sustainable policy requirements to tendering, with the most pressing technology being the lack of talent and skills in using industry 4.0 and IoT technologies. The scope of this research is based on the questionnaire survey, proving a sustainable pathway to the construction industry community, which creates its own significance by including key stakeholders and those affected by these technologies.},

However, research impact and knowledge transfer are limited. In particular, uptake and upscaling of new and innovative solutions in practice remain a key challenge. Achieving a more circular use of nutrients thus goes beyond technological innovation and will benefit from a synthesis of existing research being readily available to various stakeholders in the field. The aim of the systematic map and online evidence platform described in this protocol is threefold. First, to collate and summarise scientific research on technologies that facilitate the recovery and reuse of plant nutrients and organic matter found in human excreta and domestic and municipal wastewater. Second, to present this evidence in a way that can be easily navigated by stakeholders. Third, to report on new relevant research evidence to stakeholders as it becomes available.                                         Methods               Firstly, we will produce a baseline systematic map, which will consist of an extension of two previous related syntheses. In a next stage, with help of machine learning and other automation technologies, the baseline systematic map will be transformed into `living mode' that allows for a continually updated evidence platform. The baseline systematic map searches will be performed in 4 bibliographic sources and Google Scholar. All searches will be performed in English. Coding and meta-data extraction will include bibliographic information, locations as well as the recovery and reuse pathways. The living mode will mostly rely on automation technologies in EPPI-Reviewer and the Microsoft Academic database. The new records will be automatically identified and ranked in terms of eligibility. Records above a certain `cut-off' threshold will be manually screened for eligibility. The threshold will be devised based on the empirically informed machine learning model. The evidence from the baseline systematic map and living mode will be embedded in an online evidence platform that in an interactive manner allows stakeholders to visualise and explore the systematic map findings, including knowledge gaps and clusters.},

Five dimensional communications and services, integrating information from all human senses are expected to emerge, together with holographic communications (HC), providing a truly immersive experience. HC presents a lot of challenges in terms of data gathering and transmission, demanding Artificial Intelligence empowered communication technologies such as 5G. The goal of the paper is to present a model of a context-aware holographic architecture for real time communication based on semantic knowledge extraction. This architecture~will require analyzing, combining and developing methods and algorithms for: 3D human body model acquisition; semantic knowledge extraction with deep neural networks to predict human behaviour; analysis of biometric modalities; context-aware optimization of network resource allocation for the purpose of creating a multi-party, from-capturing-to-rendering HC framework. We illustrate its practical deployment in a scenario that can open new opportunities in user experience and business model innovation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the 1970s, research on artificial intelligence in education emerged with the aim of acknowledging and accommodating the psychological aspects of the learning process. Since then, its applications have evolved and it is now used for student learning and assessment, teachers' pedagogical practice, management of educational institutions, and lifelong learning. Nevertheless, the ethical challenges of educational programmes using these systems have not been thoroughly studied. Anchored on the theoretical frame of dialogic ethics, this paper presents a section of a participatory futures research project. The goal of the research is to develop a toolkit that educators can use to ensure a smooth and ethical transition to artificial intelligence-based education while preserving the interests of educational development. This paper emphasises the need for an informed and participatory process that involves all stakeholders and begins with an expert consultation through the Delphi method, the results of which allowed the construction of eight hypothetical futures scenarios. These scenarios provide evidence that examining the ethics of using artificial intelligence systems presents an opportunity to reflect on the ethics of education as a whole. They highlight the challenge of balancing the benefits and drawbacks of such systems, especially concerning educational goals and the interplay between diverse educational actors and personal development in educational settings. The study outcomes are intended to encourage discussions on the integration of ethical artificial intelligence in education and facilitate the continuing professional development of teachers by equipping them with scenarios that can be used as a resource for training purposes.},

We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (               CRD42021240645               ) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:               NCT04216420               ). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO's Global Strategy on Digital Health.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In regulated domains like automotive, release planning is a complex process. This complex process consists of an agreement between product development processes for hardware as well as mechanic systems and approaches for software development. Particularly in automotive, the creation and synchronization of release plans for hardware as well as software is a challenge. Within the whole complex system development, it is challenging to consider the relevant stakeholders in the initial creation of a release plan. Depending on the context that a release plan shall be created for, there are different stakeholders that have to be considered from the beginning. There are numerous publications in the area of release planning, but there is no detailed research that shows which stakeholders have to be addressed in the automotive context. The aim of this work is to identify stakeholders of a release plan as an appropriate approach to create transparency in release planning in the automotive domain. Action research to elaborate relevant stakeholders for release planning was conducted at Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG. We present a detailed overview of identified stakeholders as well as their required content and added value regarding two pilot projects. With this contribution, identified stakeholders of release planning from the hardware and software points of view are introduced. We discuss, based on the results, why there are common stakeholders for the two projects and why there are individual stakeholders for each project. With this work, we present a more complete stakeholder identification and a more detailed understanding of their needs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Climate is an important driver of ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migratory behaviors, and can affect the growth, development, fecundity, dispersal, and demographic trends of populations. Changes in temperature and precipitation, and resulting shifts in plant phenology, winter severity, drought and wildfire conditions, invasive species distribution and abundance, predation, and disease have the potential to directly or indirectly affect ungulates. However, ungulate responses to climate variability and change are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map protocol aiming to describe the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and change on ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migration in North America. This map will help to identify knowledge gaps and clusters of evidence, and can be used to inform future research directions and adaptive management strategies.                                         Methods               We will catalogue evidence on how climate variability and change affect the life-histories, population dynamics, and migration patterns of the fifteen ungulate species native to North America. We will search both academic and grey literature, using academic journal databases and specialist websites. Articles will be screened for inclusion at the title/abstract and full-text levels, and data will be extracted from articles that pass the full-text review. These data will be summarized quantitatively, visually, and with a narrative review to describe the distribution and abundance of evidence on the effects of climate variability and change on ungulates in North America.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Depression is one of the leading causes of avoidable suffering and premature death worldwide, leading to the disease burden among mental disorders. Depression-related deaths can be prevented by developing and implementing good depression prevention and treatment policies. The goal of this study is to provide theoretical direction and useful references for examining the outstanding service work of depression prevention and treatment. It also aims to describe how depression prevention and treatment policies were developed and put into practice in China, along with the associated facilitators and barriers.                                         Methods               We integrated two data sources using a case study approach: a document review of relevant policy documents, published articles and reports between 2004 and 2022 (N\,=\,12 papers) and in-depth interviews (N\,=\,41). Participants were drawn from pertinent sectors to managing depression: research and academia, relevant government departments, health care providers, people with depression and their families, and community organisations. Thematic analysis was used to analyse all data.                                         Results               A comprehensive programme of work exploring specific services for depression prevention and treatment was developed in China in 2020. Facilitators of policy development and implementation include (1) political commitment and strong leadership, (2) coordination mechanisms, (3) stakeholder enthusiasm and commitment, (4) resources, and (5) the use of digital technologies. The main barriers leading to delays in policy development and implementation include (1) insufficient awareness and lack of depression literacy, (2) lack of resources and (3) stigma and social discrimination (4) lack of united action.                                         Conclusion               Although the process of implementing a distinctive service programme for depression prevention and treatment in China has been long, the current policy is in line with current global efforts. Strategies to reduce Stigma and increase knowledge about depression are part of a national and international approach to reducing the burden of depression. Political commitment and the involvement of all stakeholders remain necessary. An adequate response to depression will require the involvement of society as a whole, with joint action to reduce the risk of exposure to adversity and enhance protective factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Contact tracing apps were considered among the first tools to control the spread of COVID-19 and ease lockdown measures. While these apps can be very effective at stopping transmission and saving lives, the level of adoption remains significantly below the expected critical mass. The public debate as well as academic research about contact tracing apps emphasizes general concerns about privacy (and the associated risks) but often disregards the value-added services, as well as benefits, that can result from a larger user base. To address this gap, the study analyzes goal-congruent features as drivers for user adoption. It uses market research techniques \textendash{} specifically, conjoint analysis \textendash{} to study individual and group preferences and gain insights into the prescriptive design. While the results confirm the privacy-preserving design of most European contact tracing apps, they emphasize the role of value-added services in addressing heterogeneous user segments to drive user adoption. The findings thereby are of relevance for designing effective contact tracing apps, but also inform the user-oriented design of apps for health and crisis management that rely on sharing sensitive information.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Human exposure to nano- and microplastics (NMPs) has raised major societal concerns, yet no framework to assess the risks of NMPs for human health exists. A substantial proportion of plastic produced worldwide is not properly disposed and persists in the environment for decades while degrading. Plastic degradation generates a size continuum of fragments, including nano- and microplastic particles, with numerous associated environmental pollutants and plastic additives, and microbial communities colonising their surfaces. The ubiquitous presence of NMPs, their availability for uptake by organisms and their potential to act as vectors for toxicants and pathogens render risk assessment a priority on the political agenda at the global level. We provide a new, fully integrated risk assessment framework tailored to the specificities of NMPs, enabling an assessment of current and future human health risks from NMPs. The framework consists of four novel paradigms to the traditional risk assessment methodology. These paradigms deal with techniques in NMP analysis, gaps in empirical data, theoretical and modelling approaches and stakeholder engagement. Within the proposed framework, we propose how we can use research experiences gained so far to carry out the different steps of the assessment process, and we define priorities for further research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the wake of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor technologies, a new horizon of possibilities has emerged across diverse sectors. Livestock farming, a domain often sidelined in conventional AI discussions, stands at the cusp of this transformative wave. This paper delves into the profound potential of AI and sensor innovations in reshaping animal welfare in livestock farming, with a pronounced emphasis on a human-centric paradigm. Central to our discourse is the symbiotic interplay between cutting-edge technology and human expertise. While AI and sensor mechanisms offer real-time, comprehensive, and objective insights into animal welfare, it's the farmer's intrinsic knowledge of their livestock and environment that should steer these technological strides. We champion the notion of technology as an enhancer of farmers' innate capabilities, not a substitute. Our manuscript sheds light on: Objective Animal Welfare Indicators: An exhaustive exploration of health, behavioral, and physiological metrics, underscoring AI's prowess in delivering precise, timely, and objective evaluations. Farmer-Centric Approach: A focus on the pivotal role of farmers in the adept adoption and judicious utilization of AI and sensor technologies, coupled with discussions on crafting intuitive, pragmatic, and cost-effective solutions tailored to farmers' distinct needs. Ethical and Social Implications: A discerning scrutiny of the digital metamorphosis in farming, encompassing facets like animal privacy, data safeguarding, responsible AI deployment, and potential technological access disparities. Future Pathways: Advocacy for principled technology design, unambiguous responsible use guidelines, and fair technology access, all echoing the fundamental principles of human-centric computing and analytics. In essence, our paper furnishes pioneering insights at the crossroads of farming, animal welfare, technology, and ethics. It presents a rejuvenated perspective, bridging the chasm between technological advancements and their human beneficiaries, resonating seamlessly with the ethos of the Human-Centric Intelligent Systems journal. This comprehensive analysis thus marks a significant stride in the burgeoning domain of human-centric intelligent systems, especially within the digital livestock farming landscape, fostering a harmonious coexistence of technology, animals, and humans.},

However, domain experts are often not formally engaged in ontology development, and there is little available guidance on how this involvement should best be conducted and managed. Social and behavioural science studies often involve expert feedback in the development of tools and classification systems but have had little engagement with ontology development. This paper aims to (i) demonstrate how expert feedback can enhance ontology development, and (ii) provide practical recommendations on how to conduct expert feedback in ontology development using methodologies from the social and behavioural sciences.                                         Main body               Considerations for selecting methods for engaging stakeholders are presented. Mailing lists and issue trackers as existing methods used frequently in ontology development are discussed. Advisory boards and working groups, feedback tasks, consensus exercises, discussions and workshops are presented as potential methods from social and behavioural sciences to incorporate in ontology development.                                         Conclusions               A variety of methods from the social and behavioural sciences exist to enable feedback from expert stakeholders in ontology development. Engaging domain experts in ontology development enables depth and clarity in ontology development, whilst also establishing advocates for an ontology upon its completion.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The transition to industry 4.0 has impacted factories, but it also affects the entire value chain. In this sense, human-centred factors play a core role in transitioning to sustainable manufacturing processes and consumption. The awareness of human roles in Industry 4.0 is increasing, as evidenced by active work in developing methods, exploring influencing factors, and proving the effectiveness of design oriented to humans. However, numerous studies have been brought into existence but then disconnected from other studies. As a consequence, these studies in industry and research alike are not regularly adopted, and the network of studies is seemingly broad and expands without forming a coherent structure. This study is a unique attempt to bridge the gap through the literature characteristics and lessons learnt derived from a collection of case studies regarding human-centred design (HCD) in the context of Industry 4.0. This objective is achieved by a well-rounded systematic literature review whose special unit of analysis is given to the case studies, delivering contributions in three ways: (1) providing an insight into how the literature has evolved through the cross-disciplinary lens; (2) identifying what research themes associated with design methods are emerging in the field; (3) and setting the research agenda in the context of HCD in Industry 4.0, taking into account the lessons learnt, as uncovered by the in-depth review of case studies.},

However, the process of transferring properties and engaging with various stakeholders can be hindered by a lack of adequate information, complex procedures, and excessive paperwork. The advent of digital real estate has revolutionized the industry and how stakeholders interact. The present study aims to conduct a bibliometric and systematic review of digital real estate, utilizing historical, institutional, country, and keyword analyses for the bibliometric review and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for the systematic review. Through thematic analysis, the study identified four key themes for transforming digital real estate: information communication technologies, data collection technologies, data networking tools, and digital decision-making systems. Additionally, the study proposes a digital real estate transformation framework that can assist stakeholders, urban planners, and decision-makers in embracing digital tools and technologies. The study concludes that digital real estate has the potential to revolutionize future urban planning and real estate development through the use of decision support systems and advanced technologies.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies offer new ways of conducting decision-making tasks that influence the daily lives of citizens, such as coordinating traffic, energy distributions, and crowd flows. They can sort, rank, and prioritize the distribution of fines or public funds and resources. Many of the changes that AI technologies promise to bring to such tasks pertain to decisions that are collectively binding. When these technologies become part of critical infrastructures, such as energy networks, citizens are affected by these decisions whether they like it or not, and they usually do not have much say in them. The democratic challenge for those working on AI technologies with collectively binding effects is both to               develop               and               deploy               technologies in such a way that the democratic legitimacy of the relevant decisions is safeguarded. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework to help policymakers, project managers, innovators, and technologists to assess and develop approaches to democratize AI. This framework embraces a broad sociotechnical perspective that highlights the interactions between technology and the complexities and contingencies of the context in which these technologies are embedded. We start from the problem-based and practice-oriented approach to democracy theory as developed by political theorist Mark Warren. We build on this approach to describe practices that can enhance or challenge democracy in political systems and extend it to integrate a sociotechnical perspective and make the role of technology explicit. We then examine how AI technologies can play a role in these practices to improve or inhibit the democratic nature of political systems. We focus in particular on AI-supported political systems in the energy domain.},

All problems, including complex global problems such as air pollution and pandemics require reliable data sharing between disciplines in order to respond effectively. Current reporting methods also lack information about the ways in which different people and organisations are involved in initiatives, making it difficult to collate and appraise data about the most effective ways to involve different people. The objective of STARDIT (                 Sta                 nda                 r                 dised                 D                 ata on                 I                 ni                 t                 iatives) is to address current limitations and inconsistencies in sharing data about initiatives. The STARDIT system features standardised data reporting about initiatives, including who has been involved, what tasks they did, and any impacts observed. STARDIT was created to help everyone in the world find and understand information about collective human actions, which are referred to as `initiatives'. STARDIT enables multiple categories of data to be reported in a standardised way across disciplines, facilitating appraisal of initiatives and aiding synthesis of evidence for the most effective ways for people to be involved in initiatives. This article outlines progress to date on STARDIT; current usage; information about submitting reports; planned next steps and how anyone can become involved.                                                        Method               STARDIT development is guided by participatory action research paradigms, and has been co-created with people from multiple disciplines and countries. Co-authors include cancer patients, people affected by rare diseases, health researchers, environmental researchers, economists, librarians and academic publishers. The co-authors also worked with Indigenous peoples from multiple countries and in partnership with an organisation working with Indigenous Australians.                                         Results and discussion               Over 100 people from multiple disciplines and countries have been involved in co-designing STARDIT since 2019. STARDIT is the first open access web-based data-sharing system which standardises the way that information about initiatives is reported across diverse fields and disciplines, including information about which tasks were done by which stakeholders. STARDIT is designed to work with existing data standards. STARDIT data will be released into the public domain (CC0) and integrated into Wikidata; it works across multiple languages and is both human and machine readable. Reports can be updated throughout the lifetime of an initiative, from planning to evaluation, allowing anyone to be involved in reporting impacts and outcomes. STARDIT is the first system that enables sharing of standardised data about initiatives across disciplines. A working Beta version was publicly released in February 2021 (ScienceforAll.World/STARDIT). Subsequently, STARDIT reports have been created for peer-reviewed research in multiple journals and multiple research projects, demonstrating the usability. In addition, organisations including Cochrane and Australian Genomics have created prospective reports outlining planned initiatives.                                         Conclusions               STARDIT can help create high-quality standardised information on initiatives trying to solve complex multidisciplinary global problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In response to rapidly changing market and customer needs, product design and development (PDD) is evolving into a human-centred and data-driven design paradigm. The design environment gets more open often involving crowdsourcing and the design process becomes more complex, considering product family design along product whole lifecycle development, and needing more data support. Therefore, it is critical to effectively capture, share, and manage design-related information in such a complex design environment. From this perspective, it is a prerequisite to have a proper product design lifecycle information model (PDLIM) to guide information gathering, sharing and management. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there lacks such a PDLIM to support effective PDD, though digital twin (DT) technology shows a great potential of supporting product lifecycle information collection and management. In this paper, the overall structure of the proposed PDLIM is firstly developed to frame in all main product lifecycle stages and the corresponding key phases for structurally capturing and storing necessary data along a product lifecycle. Secondly, key design information items against the main product lifecycle stages and their corresponding key phases are explored from literature reviews and case study analyses. Thirdly, the necessity of the identified information items in the PDLIM is qualitatively evaluated by two case studies. Finally, the PDLIM is further evaluated by applying formal object-role modelling (ORM) to demonstrate how design information items are used and interacted in exemplary design interaction scenarios, and to approve that it can be formally described and managed as an information model. The evaluation results show that the PDLIM is feasible to be adapted in a crowdsourcing-combined PDD process for supporting design management, reviewing, quality control, and next round product redesign and improvement.},

  abstract = {Abstract             While the majority of literature on remanufacturing operations examines an end-of-life (EOL) strategy which is both manual and mechanised, authors generally agree that digitalisation of remanufacturing is expected to increase in the next decade. Subsequently, a new research area described as digitally-enabled remanufacturing, remanufacturing 4.0 or smart remanufacturing is emerging. This is an automated, data-driven system of remanufacturing by means of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigms. Insights into smart remanufacturing can be provided through simulation modelling of the remanufacturing process. While the use of simulation modelling in order to predict responses and behaviour is prevalent in remanufacturing, the use of these tools in smart remanufacturing is still limited in literature. The goal of this research is to present, as a first of its kind, a comparative understanding of simulation modelling in remanufacturing in order to suggest the ideal modelling tool for smart remanufacturing. The proposed comparison includes system dynamics, discrete event simulation and agent based modelling techniques. We apply these modelling techniques on a smart remanufacturing space of a sensor-enabled product and use assumptions derived from industry experts. We then proceed to model the remanufacturing operation from sorting and inspection of cores to final inspection of the remanufactured product. Through our analysis of the assumptions utilised and simulation modelling results we conclude that, while individual modelling techniques present important strategic and operational insights, their individual use may not be sufficient to offer comprehensive knowledge to remanufacturers due to the challenge of data complexity that smart remanufacturing offers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Research is currently being conducted on the use of robots as human labor support technology. In particular, the service industry needs to allocate more manpower, and it will be important for robots to support people. This study focuses on using a humanoid robot as a social service robot to convey information in a shopping mall, and the types of robot behaviors were analyzed. In order to convey the information, two processes must occur. Pedestrians must stop in front of the robot, and the robot must continue the engagement with them. For the purpose of this study, three types of autonomous robot behaviors were analyzed and compared in these processes in the experiment: greeting, in-trouble, dancing behaviors. After interactions were attempted with 5,000+ pedestrians, this study revealed that the in-trouble behavior can make pedestrians stop more and stay longer. In addition, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the robot in a real environment, the comparative results between three robot behaviors and human advertisers revealed that (1) the results of the greeting and dancing behavior are comparable to those of the humans, and (2) the performance of the in-trouble behavior in providing information tasks is higher than that of all human advertisers. These findings demonstrate that the performance of robots is comparable to that of humans in providing information tasks in a limited environment; therefore, it is expected that service robots as a labor support technology will be able to perform well in the real world.},

Although such narratives have their merits, they can also be misleading and should be taken with a pinch of salt. The paper intends to complement such narratives in connection with the open issues on the balance of powers between EU institutions and member states (MS), with a new generation of digital rights at both EU and MS constitutional levels, down to the interplay between new models of legal governance and the potential fragmentation of the system. Whether and to what extent EU law will be successful in the regulation of data-driven societies and complex digital ecosystems do not only regard acts, policies, and proposals against misuses and overuses of technology but also how well mechanisms of coordination and models of cooperation set up by EU law will fare against technological underuses with their opportunity costs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the twenty-first century, the notion of the state and its role in innovation and development have become dominant topics of theoretical and empirical inquiry. Although contemporary innovation theorists clearly unpack the myth of market fundamentalism in industrial policy and practice of neo-liberal states, they do not seem to explain precisely how come such states have been justified to play extensive roles in the economy. This paper provides a theoretical explanation by drawing lessons from Poulantzas' approach to the state and going beyond it to consider alternatives. Accordingly, it conceives the innovation state as a result of the social division of labour and as a condensation of conflicting social relations which have their own materiality. The paper argues that whatever form the innovation state has taken in the western world since the industrial revolution, this has remained predominantly capitalist. Thus, it reproduces the social division of labour that is exploitative and unjust, delivering most benefits of innovation to dominant classes and excluding the very poor and the marginalised. The kind of innovation state that matters for social justice is a non-capitalist one, promoting pluralism of societies of equals through innovation.},

This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the scientific literature proposing devices, and software applications aimed at fostering accessible wayfinding and navigation in indoor and outdoor environments. We selected 111 out of 806 papers published in the period 2009\textendash 2020, and we analyzed them according to different dimensions: at first, we surveyed which solutions have been proposed to address the considered problem; then, we analyzed the selected papers according to five dimensions: context of use, target users, hardware/software technologies, type of data sources, and user role in system design and evaluation. Our findings highlight trends and gaps related to these dimensions. The paper finally presents a reflection on challenges and open issues that must be taken into consideration for the design of future accessible places and of related technologies and applications aimed at facilitating wayfinding and navigation.},

This relationship, which is presented in the academic literature as a new driving force of contemporary urbanism, will be investigated through an interdisciplinary approach that places urban studies and philosophy of technology in dialogue. Thus, the analysis will not focus on the technological development of artificial intelligence systems but on how their application can affect urbanistic thinking and vice versa. The chart that is produced by this method is based on two fundamental axes: time and space. AI urbanism will then be inquired first through key turning points in the history of the relationship between technology and the city (modern urbanism, cybernetics and the smart city paradigm). Secondly, the spatial implications of urban AI will be investigated from the point of view of the concrete applications of this technology to the city (Robots, AVs, Software agents) and their impact on the relationships between different urban actors. Ultimately, this work aims to offer a conceptual tool for understanding some decisive implications of the relationship between AI and urbanism, such as the connection between quantitative and qualitative approaches, the implications related to autonomous technology, the economic-political background of AI urbanism, the material urban impact of AI, and the relationship between AI and other urban intelligences. Understanding these implications will be valuable for future research on AI urbanism oriented toward transforming simple technological development into sustainable urban innovations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Software systems start to include other types of interfaces beyond the ``traditional'' Graphical-User Interfaces (GUIs). In particular, Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) such as chat and voice are becoming more and more popular. These new types of interfaces embed smart natural language processing components to understand user requests and respond to them. To provide an integrated user experience all the user interfaces in the system should be aware of each other and be able to collaborate. This is what is known as a               multiexperience               User Interface. Despite their many benefits, multiexperience UIs are challenging to build. So far CUIs are created as standalone components using a platform-dependent set of libraries and technologies. This raises significant integration, evolution and maintenance issues. This paper explores the application of model-driven techniques to the development of software applications embedding a multiexperience User Interface. We will discuss how raising the abstraction level at which these interfaces are defined enables a faster development and a better deployment and integration of each interface with the rest of the software system and the other interfaces with whom it may need to collaborate. In particular, we propose a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for specifying several types of CUIs and show how this DSL can be part of an integrated modeling environment able to describe the interactions between the modeled CUIs and the other models of the system (including the models of the GUI). We will use the standard Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) as an example ``host'' language.},

The nature of such offerings requires the involvement of multiple actors, which has been investigated by a few studies only. In particular, little is known about the multiple actors' efforts to manage uncertainty in the process of establishing smart service systems. Empirically grounded in data from 25 interviews with industry experts, we explore how organizations act and interact in smart service innovation processes. For our data analysis, we adopt a microfoundational view to derive a theoretical model that conceptualizes actor engagement as a microfoundation for iterative uncertainty reduction in the actor-to-actor network of the smart service system. Our study contributes to information systems research on service systems engineering and digital transformation by explaining smart service innovation from both a multi-actor and a multi-level perspective, drawing on service-dominant (S-D) logic and microfoundations as well-established theoretical lenses.},

Our objective is to highlight the urgent need to overcome economic, disciplinary, national, cultural, and regional barriers, in order to work out innovative measures to create a sustainable future and prevent the mutual extinction of humans and other species. We emphasize the pervasive neglect paid to the cross-dependency of planetary health, the health of individual human beings and other species. It is critical that social and natural sciences are taken into account as key contributors to forming policies related to biodiversity, conservation, and health management. We are reaching the target date of Nagoya treaty signatories to have accomplished measures to prevent biodiversity loss, providing a unique opportunity for policy makers to make necessary adjustments and refocus targets for the next decade. We propose recommendations for policy makers to explore novel avenues to halt the accelerated global loss of biodiversity. Beyond the critical ecological functions biodiversity performs, its enormous untapped the repertoire of natural molecular diversity is needed for solving accelerating global healthcare challenges.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The emergence of quantum information technologies with potential application across diverse industrial, consumer and technical domains has thrown into relief the need for practical approaches to their governance. Technology governance must balance multiple objectives including facilitating technological development while meeting legal requirements, normative expectations and managing risks regarding the use of such technology. In this paper, we articulate a variety of idealised governance models and approaches for synthesising these complementary and sometimes competing objectives. We set out a comparative analysis of quantum governance in the context of existing models of technological governance. Using this approach, we develop an actor-instrument model for quantum governance, denoted the `quantum governance stack', across a governance hierarchy from states and governments through to public and private institutions. Our model sets out key characteristics that quantum governance should exhibit at each level in the stack, including identification of stakeholder rights, interests and obligations impacted by quantum technologies and the appropriate instruments by which such impacts are managed. We argue that quantum governance must be responsive based on (a) the state of technology at the time; (b) resource and economic requirements for its development; and (c) assessments and estimates of the near-term and future impacts of such technology. Our work provides a pragmatic introduction to quantum governance by (a) specifying a taxonomy of governance actors and instruments and (b) providing examples of how different stakeholders within the stack might implement governance responses to quantum information technologies. It is intended for use by stakeholders in government, industry, academia and civil society to help inform their governance response to the quantum technology revolution.},

Achieving a high level of resilience is thereby a recognized, essential ability of future manufacturing systems with the advances in smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. In this work, a conceptual framework for resilient manufacturing strategy enabled by Industrial Internet is proposed. It is elaborated as a four-phase, closed-loop process that centered on proactive industry assessment. Key enabling technologies for the proposed framework are outlined in data acquisition and management, big data analysis, intelligent services, and others. Industrial Internet-enabled implementations in China in response to COVID-19 have then been reviewed and discussed from 3Rs' perspective, i.e. manufacturer capacity Recovery, supply chain Resilience and emergency Response. It is suggested that an industry-specific and comprehensive selection coordinated with the guiding policy and supporting regulations should be performed at the national, at least regional level.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For almost a decade, regulators and pharmaceutical industry groups have been interested in electronic source (eSource) in clinical trials (Nordo et al. in Learn Health Syst 3:e10076, 2019). eSource may provide efficiencies and value; however, eSource adoption is fragmented and slow. Acceleration of eSource adoption is a critical step in modernizing the conduct of clinical trials. The desired future state is one in which all source data, acquired through any context (e.g., healthcare delivery, chronic disease management) and actor (e.g., healthcare professional, patient, caregiver), are completely electronic, adequate in quality, and fully acceptable in clinical trial submissions by regulators worldwide. Achieving this desired future state requires transformative change management to foster adoption and minimize the burden of implementing eSource. Realizing this vision requires collaborative and dedicated efforts from multiple stakeholders, including patients, clinical trial participants, sites, technology vendors, standards organizations, regulators, payers, and sponsors. Stakeholders should align upon guidance to promote data integrity, data privacy, data security, and interoperability. The eSource revolution requires open dialogue, inclusive of shared learnings among stakeholders, to collectively and rapidly advance adoption. Adoption of eSource will optimize clinical research by enabling faster access to research data and more rapid decision-making, increasing clinical trial efficiency. Furthermore, adoption of eSource will improve data integrity by allowing direct data flow from the source to the sponsor's system, with minimal or no human intervention. This paper provides the TransCelerate point of view (POV) and recommendations to achieve the future state vision of complete utilization of eSource data in clinical trials and builds on previous TransCelerate eSource publications.},

Human interventions aim to buffer against or overcome these threats by providing physical protection for existing coastal infrastructure and communities, along with added ecological, social, or economic co-benefits. These interventions are a type of nature-based solution (NBS), broadly defined as actions working with nature to address societal challenges while also providing benefits for human well-being, biodiversity, and resilience. Despite the increasing popularity of NBS for coastal protection, sometimes in lieu of traditional hardened shorelines (e.g., oyster reefs instead of bulkheads), gaps remain in our understanding of whether common NBS interventions for coastal protection perform as intended. To help fill these knowledge gaps, we aim to identify, collate, and map the evidence base surrounding the performance of active NBS interventions related to coastal protection across a suite of ecological, physical, social, and economic outcomes in salt marsh, seagrass, kelp, mangrove, shellfish reef, and coral reef systems. The resulting evidence base will highlight the current knowledge on NBS performance and inform future uses of NBS meant for coastal protection.                                         Methods               Searches for primary literature on performance of NBS for coastal protection in shallow, biogenic ecosystems will be conducted using a predefined list of indexing platforms, bibliographic databases, open discovery citation indexes, and organizational databases and websites, as well as an online search engine and novel literature discovery tool. All searches will be conducted in English and will be restricted to literature published from 1980 to present. Resulting literature will be screened against set inclusion criteria (i.e., population, intervention, outcome, study type) at the level of title and abstract followed by full text. Screening will be facilitated by a web-based active learning tool that incorporates user feedback via machine learning to prioritize articles for review. Metadata will be extracted from articles that meet inclusion criteria and summarized in a narrative report detailing the distribution and abundance of evidence surrounding NBS performance, including evidence clusters, evidence gaps, and the precision and sensitivity of the search strategy.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic tested the resilience of the health system and its shock-absorbing capacity to continue offering healthcare services. The available evidences does not provide comprehensive insight into primary health care (PHC) system functioning across low- and~middle- income countries (LMICs) during the pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to generate evidence on the resilience of PHC systems in LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                         Methods               A scoping review was carried out utilizing an iterative search strategy using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the WHO COVID-19 electronic databases. Data from the identified studies in LMICs were charted in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist in the first step. The analysis framework was adapted and modified using COVID-19 and health systems resilience framework developed by Sagan et~al., Blanchet et~al., and the WHO position paper on `Building health systems resilience for universal health coverage and health security during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond'. A total of 26 documents were included on the basis of predefined eligibility criteria for our analysis.                                         Results               Our review explored data from 44 LMICs that implemented strategies at the PHC level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the LMICs developed national guidelines on sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (SRMNCAH). Most of the countries also transformed and reoriented PHC service delivery by introducing digital healthcare services to continue essential services. Task shifting, task sharing, and redeployment of retired staff were some frequently adopted health workforce strategies adopted by most of the countries. Only a few of the countries demonstrated the availability of necessary monetary resources to respond to the pandemic.                                         Conclusions               The functionality of the PHC system during the COVID-19 pandemic was demonstrated by a variety of resilience strategies across the six building blocks of the health system. To strengthen PHC resilience, we recommend strengthening community-based PHC, cross-sectoral collaboration, establishing surveillance systems, capacity building in financial risk planning, and investing in strengthening the digital healthcare system.},

Underperforming iSCs have been widely acknowledged as a key constraint to achieving high immunization coverage rates in low- and middle-income countries. This paper details the system design approach used to analyze the iSC network in Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Niger and Guinea and documents six lessons.                                         Methodology               Between 2018 and 2020, these countries implemented the system design approach, involving four key steps: (1) advocate and introduce to engage stakeholders and prioritize identification of modeling scenarios; (2) collect data and plan analysis through document review and key informant interviews; (3) analyze system design scenarios using computer software modeling tools (LLamasoft's Supply Chain Guru and AnyLogic's AnyLogistix) for optimization and simulation modeling as well as further analysis with Excel, Google maps, and OpenStreetMap; and (4) build consensus on optimized model and implementation roadmap using the Traffic Light Analysis tool and building on stakeholder input.                                         Findings               Key lessons include the following: (1) define system design objectives based on country priorities; (2) establish consensus with stakeholders on scenarios to model; (3) modeling provides the evidence but not the answer; (4) costs should not be weighted above other decision criteria; (5) data collection\textemdash work smarter, not harder; (6) not all questions can be answered with a computer model.                                         Discussion               A system design approach can identify changes to the design of the supply chain that can introduce efficiencies and improve reliability. This approach can be more effective when these lessons and principles are applied at the country level. The lessons from these four countries contribute to global thinking and best practices related to system design. The modeling and system design approach provides illustrative results to guide decision-makers. It does not give a "final answer", but compares and contrasts.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The world is facing the problem of anthropogenic climate change and air pollution. Despite many years of development, already established methods of influencing behaviour remain ineffective. The effect of such interventions is very often a declaration of behaviour change that is not followed by actual action. Moreover, despite intensive information campaigns, many people still do not have adequate knowledge on the subject, are not aware of the problem or, worse, deny its existence. Previous attempts to introduce real change were based on providing information, persuasion or visualisation. We propose the use of multi-sensory virtual reality to investigate the problem more thoroughly and then design appropriate solutions. In this paper, we introduce a new immersive virtual environment that combines free exploration with a high level of experimental control, physiological and behavioural measures. It was created on the basis of transdisciplinary scientific cooperation, participatory design and research. We used the unique features of virtual environments to reverse and expand the idea of pollution pods by Pinsky. Instead of closing participants in small domes filled with chemical substances imitating pollution, we made it possible for them to freely explore an open environment - admiring the panorama of a small town from the observation deck located on a nearby hill. Virtual reality technology enables the manipulation of representations of air pollution, the sensory modalities with which they are transmitted (visual, auditory, tactile and smell stimuli) and their intensity.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Shallow, tropical coral reefs face compounding threats from habitat degradation due to coastal development and pollution, impacts from storms and sea-level rise, and pulse disturbances like blast fishing, mining, dredging, and ship groundings that reduce coral reefs' height and variability. One approach toward restoring coral reef structure from these threats is deploying built structures. Built structures range from engineered modules and repurposed materials to underwater sculptures and intentionally placed natural rocks. Restoration practitioners and coastal managers increasingly consider incorporating built structures, including nature-based solutions, into coral reef-related applications. Yet, synthesized evidence on the ecological and physical performance of built structure interventions across a variety of contexts (e.g., restoration, coastal protection, mitigation, tourism) is not readily available to guide decisions. To help inform management decisions, here we aim to document the global evidence base on the ecological and physical performance of built structures in shallow ({$\leq$}\,30~m) tropical (35\textdegree{} N to 35\textdegree{} S latitude) coral ecosystems. The collated evidence base on use cases and associated ecological and physical outcomes of built structure interventions can help inform future consideration of built structures in reef restoration design, siting, and implementation.                                         Method               To discover evidence on the performance of built structures in coral reef-related applications, such as restoration, mitigation, and coastal protection, primary literature will be searched across indexing platforms, bibliographic databases, open discovery citation indexes, a web-based search engine, a novel literature discovery tool, and organizational websites. The geographic scope of the search is global, and there is no limitation to temporal scope. Primary literature will be screened first at the level of title and abstract and then at the full text level against defined eligibility criteria for the population, intervention, study type, and outcomes of interest. Metadata will be extracted from studies that pass both screening levels. The resulting data will be analyzed to determine the distribution and abundance of evidence. Results will be made publicly available and reported in a systematic map that includes a narrative description, identifies evidence clusters and gaps, and outlines future research directions on the use of built structures in coral reef-related applications.},

Advances in AI create a greater need to examine ethical considerations involving the development and implementation of such systems. Integrating ethics into artificial intelligence-based programs is crucial for preventing negative outcomes, such as privacy breaches and biased decision making. Human\textendash AI teaming (HAIT) presents additional challenges, as the ethical principles and moral theories that provide justification for them are not yet computable by machines. To that effect, models of human judgments and decision making, such as the agent-deed-consequence (ADC) model, will be crucial to inform the ethical guidance functions in AI team mates and to clarify how and why humans (dis)trust machines. The current paper will examine the ADC model as it is applied to the context of HAIT, and the challenges associated with the use of human-centric ethical considerations when applied to an AI context.},

The instrument is based on the results of a systematic literature review and was developed and validated by involving a total of five domain experts and conducting a field study among six DevOps team members. To this end, we used qualitative and survey-based data collection methods from participatory action research as well as design science. The resulting instrument encompasses five dimensions, covering seventeen capabilities and thirty-eight associated practices. The practices are evaluated on five capability levels. The results of the validation process indicate clear agreement of the domain experts and team members with all aspects of the instrument. As a contribution to practice, this research offers a pragmatic tool for IS practitioners which provides insight into the status of their DevOps transformation and offers directions for improving DevOps team performance. Furthermore, this research contributes to the ongoing research stream on DevOps by providing novel insights into the nature of DevOps capabilities and their potential configurations.},

However, evidence suggests that despite the growing number and coverage of PAs worldwide, biodiversity trends continue to deteriorate, and human pressure increases outside and inside PAs. While many studies have focused on the effectiveness of PAs in maintaining ecological features, less attention has been given to the threat reduction potential of PAs, despite threats being one of the main factors leading to the need to conserve biodiversity. It is therefore essential to understand PAs' role in addressing threats. In this paper, we describe the protocol for conducting a systematic review to explore and review the evidence surrounding the effectiveness of PAs as an intervention to reduce threats to biodiversity. We will examine the role of PAs in addressing several types of threats. Thus, our primary research question is: How effective are protected areas for reducing threats to biodiversity?                                         Methods               This protocol follows the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence guidelines for evidence synthesis and complies with the ROSES (Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Synthesis) reporting framework. We will use a comprehensive search, covering databases such as Web of Science\textemdash core collection and Scopus and organizational websites to capture relevant grey literature. Our search terms and strategies aim to find studies assessing change of threats given in PAs at any scale and ecosystem type capturing literature in English. Independent reviewers will screen search results at the title\textemdash abstract, and full text levels. In order to evaluate the relevance of the evidence, we will use the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Critical Appraisal Tool. The results will be presented as a narrative synthesis supported by quantitative data. Additionally, a meta-analysis, if possible, will be performed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The paper presents a multi-faceted data-driven computational approach to analyse workplace-based assessment (WBA) of clinical skills in medical education. Unlike formal university-based part of the degree, the setting of WBA can be informal and only loosely regulated, as students are encouraged to take every opportunity to learn from the clinical setting. For clinical educators and placement coordinators it is vital to follow and analyse students' engagement with WBA while on placements, in order to understand how students are participating in the assessment, and what improvements can be made. We analyse digital data capturing the students' WBA attempts and comments on how the assessments went, using process mining and text analytics. We compare Year 1 cohorts across three years, focusing on differences between primary vs. secondary care placements. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the exploration of computational approaches for multi-faceted, data-driven assessment analytics for workplace learning which includes:(i) a set of features for analysing clinical skills WBA data, (ii) analysis of the temporal aspects ofthat data using process mining, and (iii) utilising text analytics to compare student reflections on WBA. We show how assessment data captured during clinical placements can provide insights about the student engagement and inform the medical education practice. Our work is inspired by Jim Greer's vision that intelligent methods and techniques should be adopted to address key challenges faced by educational practitioners in order to foster improvement of learning and teaching. In the broader AI in Education context, the paper shows the application of AI methods to address educational challenges in a new informal learning domain - practical healthcare placements in higher education medical training.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study presents a modular-based implementation of augmented reality to provide an immersive experience in learning or teaching the planning phase, control system, and machining parameters of a fully automated work cell. The architecture of the system consists of three code modules that can operate independently or combined to create a complete system that is able to guide engineers from the layout planning phase to the prototyping of the final product. The layout planning module determines the best possible arrangement in a layout for the placement of various machines, in this case a conveyor belt for transportation, a robot arm for pick-and-place operations, and a computer numerical control milling machine to generate the final prototype. The robotic arm module simulates the pick-and-place operation offline from the conveyor belt to a computer numerical control (CNC) machine utilising collision detection and inverse kinematics. Finally, the CNC module performs virtual machining based on the Uniform Space Decomposition method and axis aligned bounding box collision detection. The conducted case study revealed that given the situation, a semi-circle shaped arrangement is desirable, whereas the pick-and-place system and the final generated G-code produced the highest deviation of 3.83\,mm and 5.8\,mm respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Predictive models for clinical outcomes that are accurate on average in a patient population may underperform drastically for some subpopulations, potentially introducing or reinforcing inequities in care access and quality. Model training approaches that aim to maximize worst-case model performance across subpopulations, such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO), attempt to address this problem without introducing additional harms. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of DRO and several variations of standard learning procedures to identify approaches for model development and selection that consistently improve disaggregated and worst-case performance over subpopulations compared to standard approaches for learning predictive models from electronic health records data. In the course of our evaluation, we introduce an extension to DRO approaches that allows for specification of the metric used to assess worst-case performance. We conduct the analysis for models that predict in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day readmission for inpatient admissions, and predict in-hospital mortality using intensive care data. We find that, with relatively few exceptions, no approach performs better, for each patient subpopulation examined, than standard learning procedures using the entire training dataset. These results imply that when it is of interest to improve model performance for patient subpopulations beyond what can be achieved with standard practices, it may be necessary to do so via data collection techniques that increase the effective sample size or reduce the level of noise in the prediction problem.},

This paper presents a systematic review of studies of Socially Assistive Systems targeted at older adults and people with disabilities. The purpose is threefold: (1) Characterizing related assistive systems with a special focus on the system design, primarily including HCI technologies used and user-involvement approach taken; (2) Examining their ways of system evaluation; (3) Reflecting on insights for future design research.               Methods               A systematic literature search was conducted using the keywords ``social interactions'' and ``assistive technologies'' within the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, ACM, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore.               Results               Sixty-five papers met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed. Our results showed that there were 11 types of HCI technologies that supported social interactions for target users. The most common was cognitive and meaning understanding technologies, often applied with wearable devices for compensating users' sensory loss; 33.85\% of studies involved end-users and stakeholders in the design phase; Four types of evaluation methods were identified. The majority of studies adopted laboratory experiments to measure user-system interaction and system validation. Proxy users were used in system evaluation, especially in initial experiments; 42.46\% of evaluations were conducted in field settings, primarily including the participants' own homes and institutions.               Conclusion               We contribute an overview of Socially Assistive Systems that support social interactions for older adults and people with disabilities, as well as illustrate emerging technologies and research opportunities for future work.},

We contribute to such debate by analysing the relation between two different digitalization dimensions, namely fixed and mobile broadband connections penetration, and CO               2               emissions at the country level. Our paper provides empirical evidence, based on a panel of 35 OECD countries, that higher fixed and mobile broadband penetration levels are associated with lower levels of CO               2               emissions, according to an Environmental Kuznets Curve-type relation. Moreover, we investigate whether the environmental effects of these two digitalization dimensions differ across high- and low-income OECD countries. By adopting fixed-effects models and fixed-effects two-stage least square estimators, the results, besides substantiating the Kuznet's hypothesis in both groups of nations, confirm that higher fixed and mobile broadband penetration levels are associated to a reduction of CO               2               emissions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The translation of research findings into practice can be improved to maximize benefits more quickly and with greater flexibility. To expedite translation, researchers have developed innovative approaches to implementation branded as ``rapid'' and ``agile'' implementation. Rapid implementation has roots in precision medicine and agile implementation has roots in systems engineering and software design. Research has shown that innovation often derives from learning and applying ideas that have impacted other fields.                                         Implications for implementation researchers               This commentary examines ``rapid'' and ``agile'' approaches to implementation and provides recommendations to implementation researchers stemming from these approaches. Four key ideas are synthesized that may be broadly applicable to implementation research, including (1) adopting a problem orientation, (2) applying lessons from behavioral economics, (3) using adaptive study designs and adaptive interventions, and (4) using multi-level models to guide implementation. Examples are highlighted from the field where researchers are applying these key ideas to illustrate their potential impact.                                         Conclusions               ``Rapid'' and ``agile'' implementation approaches to implementation stem from diverse fields. Elements of these approaches show potential for advancing implementation research, although adopting them may entail shifting scientific norms in the field.},

With the rise and development of intelligent manufacturing, design has increasingly reflected its importance in the product life cycle. Firstly, the concept and connotation of complex product design is expounded systematically, and the different types of design are discussed. The four schools of design theory are introduced, including universal design, axiomatic design, TRIZ and general design. Then the research status of complex product design is analyzed, such as innovative design, digital design, modular design, reliability optimization design, etc. Finally, three key scientific issues worthy of research in the future are indicated, and five research trends of ``newer, better, smarter, faster, and greener'' are summarized, aiming to provide references for the equipment design and manufacturing industry.},

Empirical evaluation studies are required to keep biased AI models from reinforcing systemic health disparities faced by minority populations through dangerous feedback loops. The aim of this study is to raise broad awareness of the pervasive challenges around bias and fairness in risk prediction models. We performed a case study on a MIMIC-trained benchmarking model using a broadly applicable fairness and generalizability assessment framework. While open-science benchmarks are crucial to overcome many study limitations today, this case study revealed a strong class imbalance problem as well as fairness concerns for Black and publicly insured ICU patients. Therefore, we advocate for the widespread use of comprehensive fairness and performance assessment frameworks to effectively monitor and validate benchmark pipelines built on open data resources.},

Despite their increasing significance for cybersecurity incident response, there is a gap in research on values of importance to the design of open-source intelligence (OSINT) technologies for this purpose. In this paper, we investigate which values and value conflicts emerge due to the application and development of machine learning (ML) based OSINT technologies to assist cyber security incident response operators. For this purpose, we employ a triangulation of methods, consisting of a systematic survey of the technical literature on the development of OSINT artefacts for cybersecurity (N = 73) and an empirical value sensitive design case study, comprising semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (N = 9) as well as a focus group (N = 7) with developers. Based on our results, we identify implications relevant to the research on and design of OSINT artefacts for cybersecurity incident response.},

This article reports a research profiling study of almost 52,000 experience publications over 125~years, showing the breadth of experience research across disciplines. The data analysis reveals the disciplines that study experiences, the prominent authors, institutions and countries in experience research, the most cited works by experience researchers across disciplines, and how UX research is situated on the map of experience research. This descriptive research profiling study is a necessary first step on the journey of mapping the landscape of experience research, guiding researchers towards understanding experience as a multidisciplinary concept, and establishing a more coherent experience research field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A new Irish bovine tuberculosis (bTB) eradication strategy was launched in 2021. The strategy was formulated following extensive discussions with stakeholders, formal reviews of several aspects of the existing bTB policy and relevant inputs from the latest scientific research projects. A stakeholder discussion body, the TB Forum, had been established in 2018 and this continues under the new strategy, supported by three working groups (scientific, financial and implementation). The strategy sets out actions to address cattle-to-cattle and badger-to-cattle bTB transmission, along with actions to improve farm biosecurity and empower farmers to make their own choices to reduce bTB risk.                            Large scale vaccination of badgers has been rolled out under the new strategy, with over 20,000 km               2               covered by the vaccination programme and 6,586 badgers captured in vaccination areas in 2021. Vaccination efforts have been complemented by intensive communications campaigns, including a web enabled software application (``app'') enabling farmers to report the location of badger setts.                          Cattle which test inconclusive to the tuberculin skin test have been re-tested using a gamma interferon blood test since April 2021, enabling truly infected cattle to be identified more effectively due to the higher sensitivity of this test. An enhanced oversight process has been put in place for herds experiencing extended or repeat bTB breakdowns. Whole genome sequencing is being used to investigate links between breakdowns, with the results supporting operational decision making in case management.             Communications, including biosecurity advice, are co-designed with stakeholders, in order to improve their effectiveness. A programme involving veterinary practitioners providing tailored biosecurity bTB advice to their clients was established in 2021 and was rolled out nationally during 2022.             A core element of the new strategy is the continual improvement of policies in response to changing bTB risks, informed by scientific research and then implemented with stakeholder consultation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence ethics requires a united approach from policymakers, AI companies, and individuals, in the development, deployment, and use of these technologies. However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1\textendash 12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61\textendash 86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from Facebook. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation's economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees' autonomy, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations.},

Furthermore, in which way should we step aside to let all ecological actors exercise their agency? And, more specifically, what should be the role of design and designers in tackling complex issues and in contributing to a major shift in thoughts? These questions fostered a reflection on the relation between possible futures and the design practice itself and set the basis for the creation of a               provotype.               A               provotype               (from ``               provo               cation'' and ``proto               type               '') is a conceptual product or an artifact whose objective is to foster reflections and provoke discussions mainly concerning social and environmental sustainability, innovations, and technologies, leaving gaps to be filled with the audience imagination.                                         The research reported in this contribution deals with issues and questions that fall under the umbrella of the topic of alternative biopolitics in future scenarios: how can we co-design with more-than-human actors? In which way can symbiosis between different entities be achieved? What is the meaning of interspecies justice, and which should be the steps to follow to fulfill it? And, finally, maybe the most significant question to focus on: how can communication between different entities be fostered? The designed               provotype               consists of a fictional event (``The first Multispecies Symposium'') which takes place in 2100, further helped the researchers in opening new reflections that made it possible to experiment with participatory design and to finalize a tool that can be used to share and expand reflections about futures without hierarchies, not human-centered, sustainable progress and hope, participative futures.},

This blueprint is designed around research capabilities and cross-sectoral partnerships. We highlight priorities including integrating basin-scale observation, modelling and genomic approaches to understand Atlantic oceanography and ecosystem connectivity; improving ecosystem mapping; identifying potential tipping points in deep and open ocean ecosystems; understanding compound impacts of multiple stressors including warming, acidification and deoxygenation; enhancing spatial and temporal management and protection. We argue that these goals are best achieved through partnerships with policy-makers and community stakeholders, and promoting research groups from the South Atlantic through investment and engagement. Given the high costs of such research (\texteuro 800k to \texteuro 1.7M per expedition and \texteuro 30\textendash 40M for a basin-scale programme), international cooperation and funding are integral to supporting science-led policies to conserve ocean ecosystems that transcend jurisdictional borders.},

I submit Loke, a new kind of computer that is a universe of objects and nothing but objects. I call it an               object computer               . Loke is implemented in Squeak, a variant of Smalltalk, and is an extensible, conceptual model for execution, inspection, and exploration. It was first used to demonstrate how Ellen, a novice, programs a smart alarm clock through a GUI adapted to her competence, needs, and preferences. Informal demonstrations indicated that laypeople immediately grasp the idea of communicating objects that represent real things in their environment. They also wanted to use it for their own purposes. They were creative in identifying personal opportunities for Loke and in sketching out their implementations. Interestingly, expert programmers who attended the demonstration did not see the point of Loke. I have completed the programming of Loke qua conceptual model. The model underpins its potential security and privacy and sustains its object and message models. The Loke qua programming environment is still in its infancy, and its inherent security and privacy properties are still not realized in practice. A future               Loke device               will be accessible from anywhere and embedded in its own hardware to achieve them. The Loke IDE rests on Data\textendash Context\textendash Interaction (DCI), a new programming paradigm that leads to readable code with a clear architecture. I submit Loke for the pleasure of personal programming.},

However, implementing DT software systems poses significant challenges, including compliance with regulations and effective communication among stakeholders, and concerns surrounding security, privacy, and trust with the use of big data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a documentation framework for architectural decisions (DFAD) that applies the concept of big data governance to the digital system. The framework aims to ensure accountability, transparency, and trustworthiness while adhering to rules and regulations. To demonstrate its applicability, a case study and three case scenarios on the potential use of Mobile Positioning Data (MPD) in Indonesia for DT technology in smart and sustainable tourism were examined. The paper highlights the benefits of DFAD in shaping stakeholder communication and human\textendash machine interactions while leveraging the potential of MPD to measure tourism statistics by Statistics Indonesia since 2016. Not only the documentation framework promotes compliance with regulations, but it also facilitates effective communication among stakeholders and enhances trust and transparency in the use of big data in DT technology for smart and sustainable tourism. This paper emphasizes the importance of effective big data governance and its potential to promote sustainable tourism practices. The multidisciplinarity approach on political science, software engineering, tourism, and official statistics provides an opportunity for academic contribution and decision-making processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the past few years, the ethical ramifications of AI technologies (in particular data science) have been at the center of intense debates. Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding how a morally responsible practice of data science can be promoted and which values have to shape it. In this context, ethics and moral responsibility have been mainly conceptualized as compliance to widely shared principles. However, several scholars have highlighted the limitations of such a principled approach. Drawing from microethics and the virtue theory tradition, in this paper, we formulate a different approach to ethics in data science which is based on a different conception of ``being ethical'' and, ultimately, of what it means to promote a morally responsible data science. First, we develop the idea that, rather than only compliance, ethical decision-making consists in using certain moral abilities (e.g., virtues), which are cultivated by practicing and exercising them in the data science process. An aspect of virtue development that we discuss here is moral attention, which is the ability of data scientists to identify the ethical relevance of their own technical decisions in data science activities. Next, by elaborating on the capability approach, we define a technical act as ethically relevant when it impacts one or more of the basic human capabilities of data subjects. Therefore, rather than ``applying ethics'' (which can be mindless), data scientists should cultivate ethics as a form of reflection on how technical choices and ethical impacts shape one another. Finally, we show how this microethical framework concretely works, by dissecting the ethical dimension of the technical procedures involved in data understanding and preparation of electronic health records.},

While it can be applied to any code, the article presents the results of code ethnography application in the study of internet interconnection dynamics, having the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as code and two of the largest internet exchange points (IXPs) in the world as points of data collection, DE-CIX Frankfurt, and IX.br S\~ao Paulo. The results show inequalities in the flows of information between the global North and the global South and concentration of power at the level of interconnection infrastructure hitherto unknown in the context of the political economy of the internet. Code ethnography is explained in terms of code assemblage, code literacy, and code materiality. It demonstrates the grammar of BGP in context, making its logical and physical dimensions visible in the analysis of the formation of               giant internet nodes               and               infrastructural interdependencies               in the circulation information infrastructure of the internet.},

Building on 20 years of TBA experience and through a three-pillar framework (assessment, cooperation-collaboration, shared management), the key elements to addressing TBA issues are described, including a multidisciplinary approach, identification of hotspot zones, local vs border-wide approaches, appropriate funding models, and an increased recognition of the role and value of each TBA.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Alors que la d\'ependance \`a l'\'egard des eaux souterraines transfrontali\`eres augmente \`a l'\'echelle mondiale, il est important de comprendre et de r\'esoudre les probl\`emes sp\'ecifiques soulev\'es par l'\'evaluation et la gestion des aquif\`eres transfrontaliers (AT) S'appuyant sur 20 ans d'exp\'erience des AT et \`a travers une structure \`a trois piliers (\'evaluation, coop\'eration-collaboration, gestion partag\'ee), les \'el\'ements cl\'es pour r\'esoudre les probl\`emes des AT sont d\'ecrits, incluant une approche multidisciplinaire, l'identification des zones sensibles, des approches locales par rapport \`a l'ensemble de la fronti\`ere, des mod\`eles de financement appropri\'es et une reconnaissance accrue du r\^ole et de la valeur de chaque AT.           ,              Resumen             Ante la creciente utilizaci\'on de las aguas subterr\'aneas transfronterizas en todo el mundo, es importante comprender y abordar los problemas espec\'ificos que plantean la evaluaci\'on y la gesti\'on de los acu\'iferos transfronterizos (TBAs).

  abstract = {Abstract                            The quality and quantity of participation supplied by human beings during the different phases of the design and development of a software artifact are central to studies in human-centered computing. With this paper, we have investigated on what kind of experienced people should be engaged to design a new computational artifact, when a participatory approach is adopted. We compared two approaches: the former including only               future               users (i.e.,               novices               ) in the design process, and the latter enlarging the community to               expert               users. We experimented with the design of a large software artifact, in use at the University of Bologna, engaging almost 1500 users. Statistical methodologies were employed to validate our findings. Our analysis has provided mounting evidence that               expert               users have contributed to the design of the artifact only by a small amount. Instead, most of the innovative initiatives have come from               future               users, thus surpassing some traditional limitations that tend to exclude               future               users from this kind of processes. We here challenge the traditional opinion that               expert               users provide typically a more reliable contribution in a participatory software design process, demonstrating instead that               future               users would be often better suited. Along this line of sense, this is the first paper, in the field of human-centric computing, that discusses the relevant question to offer to               future               users a larger design space, intended as a higher level of freedom given in a software design situation, demarcated by precise design constraints. In this sense, the outcome has been positive.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The `Smart Home' is a strongly technology-driven field. While user-centered requirements have been reported for specific features, a considerable gap persists for design based on an everyday home context and the social and emotional nature of the home. To address this, we present a user-centered design process to question and expand narrow framings of energy-efficiency and smart control and consider the richness and variety of the domestic context as design space for smart homes. Our three-step investigation employs cultural probing, participatory design fiction, and focus groups to progress from the home context ``as-is'' towards a blending of values with technological responses. Our findings highlight the home as a complex construct imbued with organically grown practices and individual and collective needs, values, and emotions. Based on empirical, real-user data we present features and system expectations that address this multifaceted overall picture. This paper advises the design process of future smart home solutions in three facets: first, we discuss the value of the design process applied in this study and future possibilities to expand. Second, we show               design dimensions               , namely time, space, relations, individual factors, and values that allow design for a heterogeneity of users and situations. Third, we derive specific               design goals               to highlight directions of smart home system design: design for control, low effort, integration, evolvability, identity, sociability, and benefits.},

Methods               EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, pre-print servers, clinical trial registries, and relevant grey literature sources were searched until July 31, 2020, using database searching and an automated method called Continuous Active Learning\textregistered{} (CAL\textregistered ). All search results were processed using CAL\textregistered{} to identify the most likely relevant citations that were then screened by a single human reviewer. Full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal were completed by a single reviewer and verified by a second.                                         Results               Nine clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were included. The most common recommendation in the CPGs was establishing surveillance and monitoring systems followed by mandating the use of PPE; physically distancing or cohorting residents; environmental cleaning and disinfection; promoting hand and respiratory hygiene among residents, staff, and visitors; and providing sick leave compensation for staff.                                         Conclusions               Current evidence suggests robust surveillance and monitoring along with support for IPAC initiatives are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. However, there are significant gaps in the current recommendations especially with regard to the movement of staff between LTCF and their role as possible transmission vectors.

We conducted 15 focus groups examining patient views of diverse applications of AI in healthcare. Our results indicate that patients have multiple concerns, including concerns related to the safety of AI, threats to patient choice, potential increases in healthcare costs, data-source bias, and data security. We also found that patient acceptance of AI is contingent on mitigating these possible harms. Our results highlight an array of patient concerns that may limit enthusiasm for applications of AI in healthcare. Proactively addressing these concerns is critical for the flourishing of ethical innovation and ensuring the long-term success of AI applications in healthcare.},

The medical device innovation consortium (MDIC) undertook a series of projects, including multiple case studies and expert consultations, to identify approaches for utilizing patient preference information (PPI) to inform clinical trial design in the US regulatory context. Based on these activities, this paper offers a cogent review of considerations and opportunities for researchers seeking to leverage PPI within their clinical trial development programs and highlights future directions to enhance this field. This paper also discusses various approaches for maximizing stakeholder engagement in the process of incorporating PPI into the study design, including identifying novel endpoints and statistical considerations, crosswalking between attributes and endpoints, and applying findings to the population under study. These strategies can help researchers ensure that clinical trials are designed to generate evidence that is useful to decision makers and captures what matters most to patients.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            AI ethics guidelines have proposed the principle of solidarity as an important principle for Ethics in Artificial Intellligence (AI). However, they often leave out explanations on how solidarity ought to be understood and put into practice in the context of ethical AI. This paper explores the principle of solidarity in the context of AI. It examines solidarity from an Ethics in Design perspective, meaning how solidarity could be accounted for in the processes of technological design. Since solidarity conceptualisations differ depending on the respective discipline they are~applied in, this paper first attempts to disentangle the many conceptual understandings and proposes a more discipline-neutral solidarity account describing solidarity's core on the basis of five elements: (1) an               element of relationality               based on (2) a               connecting element               that builds the grounds for the relationship, (3) a               cognitive element of awareness and recognition               , (4) a               motivational source               , and (5) an               element of duty               . By using this account to explore solidarity in an AI context, it will be shown that approaching solidarity with an Ethics in Design perspective has its challenges. Therefore, it is proposed that solidarity should be conceived of~not as an ideal end state but as a perspective or lens that can guide design choices. Ethics in Design methods such as user-centric or participatory design are discussed as potential enablers  for adopting~such a solidarity perspective. Lastly, the paper addresses some challenges and limitations and argues that an approach to solidarity in Ethics in Design needs to be complemented with collective decision-making at the societal level, which is a political task.},

AI robots are expected to enhance production, while compensating for lack of manpower, reducing production costs, taking over unattractive (risky, heavy, and dirty) jobs and reducing the burden of food production on the environment. In spite of these promises, however, AI robots for agri-food also give rise to ethical questions and concerns, which have been little researched and discussed until now. To fill this gap, we developed a research agenda for future research in this area. To do this, we opened our analysis to focus on ethics AI robots generally to specifically identify which of these issues are most relevant to agro-robots. The question we want to find an answer to is: what are the most relevant ethical questions raised about AI robots for robots developed for the agri-food sector? And which questions are not mentioned in the literature, which are particularly relevant for agro-robots? Our paper will provide an overview over the key issues and areas which deserve further elaboration to come to a more mature ethics of AI agro-robots.},

Innovative health technologies have immense potential to improve human health and well-being. However, their advent does not guarantee equitable health outcomes. Not all individuals have equal access to health technologies resulting in different health outcomes for those individuals. Barriers to adoption, implementation, access, research and design can lead to exclusion and perpetuate the health inequalities already experienced by vulnerable or marginalised groups, for example those with intellectual disabilities (ID). Point of care testing (POCT) is a health technology used to monitor physical health and has been available for almost a decade. POCT is reported to be minimally invasive, can be conducted in a wide range of settings, enables shorter time to clinical decision making, improved self-management of health conditions and patient empowerment. Despite the benefits of POCT, adoption, use, awareness and research of the use of this technology in people with ID to monitor physical health appears to be scant. This article will explore the application of POCT in this group of individuals for whom evidence informs us die up to 25~years earlier when compared to the general population, and physical health disease account for the overwhelming majority of premature deaths. This is a narrative review exploring the use of POCT for physical health of people with ID.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Diabetes is a medical and economic burden in the United States. In this study, a machine learning predictive model was developed to predict unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes, and findings were used to design a clinical intervention in the sponsoring healthcare organization. This study presents a case study of how predictive analytics can inform clinical actions, and describes practical factors that must be incorporated in order to translate research into clinical practice.                                         Methods               Data were drawn from electronic medical records (EMRs) from a large healthcare organization in the Northern Plains region of the US, from adult ({$\geq$}\,18~years old) patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who received care at least once during the 3-year period. A variety of machine-learning classification models were run using standard EMR variables as predictors (age, body mass index~(BMI), systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), glycohemoglobin (A1C), smoking status, number of diagnoses and number of prescriptions). The best-performing model after cross-validation testing was analyzed to identify strongest predictors.                                         Results               The best-performing model was a linear-basis support vector machine, which achieved a balanced accuracy (average of sensitivity and specificity) of 65.7\%. This model outperformed a conventional logistic regression by 0.4 percentage points. A sensitivity analysis identified BP and HDL as the strongest predictors, such that disrupting these variables with random noise decreased the model's overall balanced accuracy by 1.3 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively. These recommendations, along with stakeholder engagement, behavioral economics strategies, and implementation science principles helped to inform the design of a clinical intervention targeting behavioral changes.                                         Conclusion               Our machine-learning predictive model more accurately predicted unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes, relative to conventional models. Post-hoc analysis of the model was used for hypothesis generation, namely that HDL and BP are the strongest contributors to unplanned medical visits among patients with diabetes. These findings were translated into a clinical intervention now being piloted at the sponsoring healthcare organization. In this way, this predictive model can be used in moving from prediction to implementation and improved diabetes care management in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The problem of controlling an artificial general intelligence (AGI) has fascinated both scientists and science-fiction writers for centuries. Today that problem is becoming more important because the time when we may have a superhuman intelligence among us is within the foreseeable future. Current average estimates place that moment to before 2060. Some estimates place it as early as 2040, which is quite soon. The arrival of the first AGI might lead to a series of events that we have not seen before: rapid development of an even more powerful AGI developed by the AGIs themselves. This has wide-ranging implications to the society and therefore it is something that must be studied well before it happens. In this paper we will discuss the problem of limiting the risks posed by the advent of AGIs. In a thought experiment, we propose an AGI which has enough human-like properties to act in a democratic society, while still retaining its essential artificial general intelligence properties. We discuss ways of arranging the co-existence of humans and such AGIs using a democratic system of coordination and coexistence. If considered a success, such a system could be used to manage a society consisting of both AGIs and humans. The democratic system where each member of the society is represented in the highest level of decision-making guarantees that even minorities would be able to have their voices heard. The unpredictability of the AGI era makes it necessary to consider the possibility that a population of autonomous AGIs could make us humans into a minority.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a widely discussed topic. There are numerous initiatives that aim to develop the principles and guidance to ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI are ethically acceptable. What is generally unclear is how organisations that make use of AI understand and address these ethical issues in practice. While there is an abundance of conceptual work on AI ethics, empirical insights are rare and often anecdotal. This paper fills the gap in our current understanding of how organisations deal with AI ethics by presenting empirical findings collected using a set of ten case studies and providing an account of the cross-case analysis. The paper reviews the discussion of ethical issues of AI as well as mitigation strategies that have been proposed in the literature. Using this background, the cross-case analysis categorises the organisational responses that were observed in practice. The discussion shows that organisations are highly aware of the AI ethics debate and keen to engage with ethical issues proactively. However, they make use of only a relatively small subsection of the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. These insights are of importance to organisations deploying or using AI, to the academic AI ethics debate, but maybe most valuable to policymakers involved in the current debate about suitable policy developments to address the ethical issues raised by AI.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A majority of American adults report having used sex toys, which, by design, interact with intimate and permeable body parts yet have not been subject to sufficient risk assessment or management. Physical and chemical data are presented examining potential risks associated with four types of currently available sex toys: anal toy, beads, dual vibrator, and external vibrator. A standardized abrasion machine made real-time breakdown of products into microplastics and nanoplastics. The microplastics from the sex toys were then solvent extracted and analyzed using GC\textendash MS. Rates of microplastics and nanoplastics released during abrasion testing from most microplastic release to least was the anal toy, beads, dual vibrator, external vibrator. Both micro- and nanoplastics particles were generated following the abrasion test, with the 50 percentile diameters (D50) ranging from the anal beads at 658.5~{$\mu$}m, dual vibrator at 887.83~{$\mu$}m, anal toy at 950~{$\mu$}m, and external vibrator at 1673.33~{$\mu$}m. The material matrix of each product was analyzed using ATR-FTIR, with results identifying the anal toy as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the anal beads as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the external vibrator as a silicone blend (polydimethylsiloxane [PDMS]), and the dual vibrator as a rubber mixture (polyisoprene). After extraction, phthalates known to be endocrine disruptors were present in all tested sex toys at levels exceeding hazard warnings. Analogous findings have been reported for similar materials that, when incorporated into other product categories, are subject to regulatory scrutiny in both the US and EU. This data set is not intended to be representative of sex toys as an entire class of products, nor are the abrasion experiments claiming to simulate exact use conditions. However, these exploratory data frame potential concerns, highlighting research questions and the need for prompt prioritization of protective action. Therefore, future studies and multi-stakeholder action are needed to understand and reduce risk for this class of products.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Cities today are dynamic urban ecosystems with evolving physical, socio-cultural, and technological infrastructures. Many contestations arise from the effects of inequitable access and intersecting crises currently faced by cities, which may be amplified by the algorithmic and data-centric infrastructures being introduced in urban contexts. In this article, I argue for a critical lens into how inter-related urban technologies, big data and policies, constituted as Urban AI, offer both challenges and opportunities. I examine scenarios of contestations in               urban mobility               , defined broadly to include equitable access, movement, and liberty to engage with the socio-cultural, political, and urban fabric of cities. I anchor my arguments through a framework of               rights, risks,               and               responsibilities               for critically examining and configuring the roles, values and ethical implications for all stakeholders including human, AI and non-human entities within an urban ecosystem. As a way forward, I examine the European Commission's proposed regulations on AI systems through an illustrative case study of an automated parking control system introduced by the City of Amsterdam. In moving beyond the city to broader urban ecosystems, I highlight the role of engaging Indigenous perspectives for designing and reconciling the implications of equitable and sustainable Urban AI ecosystems in the future.},

The impact of hyperautomation and the increasing pace of change require the integration of maturity assessment with the BPM implementation methodology, including the repetition of maturity assessment for selected groups of processes. This causes an urgent need to adapt both process maturity assessment methods and BPM MMs to changing working conditions and business requirements. This conceptual paper is based on a model approach. The framework presented in the article continues and at the same time clearly deviates from the tradition of building BPM MMs on the basis of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). It proposes a two-stage comprehensive process of organizational process maturity assessment, fully integrated into the process of BPM implementation and further business process management. The presented framework makes it possible to assess the process maturity of Industry 4.0 organizations in which dynamic knowledge-intensive business processes (kiBPs) play a key role in creating value.},

The SDGs were conceived as an `indivisible whole', but interactions between SDGs need to be better understood. Several previous assessments have begun to explore interactions including synergies and possible conflicts between the SDGs, and differ widely in their conclusions. Although some highlight the role of the more environmentally-focused SDGs in underpinning sustainable development, none specifically focuses on environment\textendash human linkages. Assessing interactions between SDGs, and the influence of environment on them can make an important contribution to informing decisions in 2020 and beyond. Here, we review previous assessments of interactions among SDGs, apply an influence matrix to assess pairwise interactions between all SDGs, and show how viewing these from the perspective of environment\textendash human linkages can influence the outcome. Environment, and environment\textendash human linkages, influence most interactions between SDGs. Our action-focused assessment enables decision makers to focus environmental management to have the greatest impacts and to identify opportunities to build on synergies and reduce trade-offs between particular SDGs. It may enable sectoral decision makers to seek support from environment managers for achieving their goals. We explore cross-cutting issues and the relevance and potential application of our approach in supporting decision making for progress to achieve the SDGs.},

Despite its importance, this is still a relatively underexamined and emerging topic. In our paper, we focus on what businesses communicate about CSR through social media and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We identified the topics discussed on Twitter, their evolution over time, and the differences across sectors. We applied the structural topic model (STM) algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the model, including document-level metadata (time and sector). This model proved to be a powerful tool for topic detection and the estimation of the effects of time and sector on the discussion proportion of the topics. Indeed, we found that the topics were well identified overall, and the model allowed catching signals from the data. We derived CSR communication indexes directly from the topic model (TM) results and propose the use of dissimilarity and homogeneity indexes to describe the communication mix and highlight differences and identify clusters.},

The review contributes to the emerging field of human-centred AI, and the even more embryonic space of VSAI in four ways: (i) it introduces three criteria for the review of VSAI based on their contribution to design processes' overall value-sensitivity, and as a response to criticisms that current interventions are lacking in these aspects: comprehensiveness, level of guidance offered, and methodological value-sensitivity, (ii) it provides a novel review of socio-technical design processes for AI-based systems, (iii) it assesses each process based on the mentioned criteria and synthesises the results into broader trends, and (iv) it offers a resulting set of recommendations for the design of VSAI. The objective of the paper is to help creators and followers of design processes\textemdash whether scholarly or industry-based\textemdash to understand the level of value-sensitivity offered by different socio-technical design processes and act accordingly based on their needs: to adopt or adapt existing processes or to create new ones.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Clinical relevance               The Keratoconus International Consortium (KIC) will allow better understanding of keratoconus.                                         Background               Keratoconus is a disorder characterised by corneal elevation and thinning, leading to reduced vision. The current gaps in understanding of this disease will be discussed and the need for a multi-pronged and multi-centre engagement to enhance our understanding of keratoconus will be highlighted.                                         Design               KIC has been established to address the gaps in our understanding of keratoconus with the aim of collecting baseline as well as longitudinal data on several fields.                                         Participants               Keratoconus and control (no corneal condition) subjects from different sites globally will be recruited in the study.                                         Methods               KIC collects data using an online, secure database, which enables standardised data collection at member sites. Data fields collected include medical history, clinical features, quality of life and economic burden questionnaires and possible genetic sample collection from patients of different ethnicities across different geographical locations.                                         Results               There are currently 40 Australian and international clinics or hospital departments who have joined the KIC. Baseline data has so far been collected on 1130 keratoconus patients and indicates a median age of 29.70~years with 61\% being male. A total of 15.3\% report a positive family history of keratoconus and 57.7\% self-report a history of frequent eye rubbing.                                         Conclusion               The strength of this consortium is its international, collaborative design and use of a common data collection tool. Inclusion and analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal data will help answer many questions that remain in keratoconus, including factors affecting progression and treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background and aim               While artificial intelligence (AI) is being adapted for various life domains and applications related to medicine and healthcare, the use of AI in nursing practice is still scarce. The German Ministry for Education and Research funded a study in order to explore needs, application scenarios, requirements, facilitators and barriers for research and development projects in the context of AI in nursing care.                                         Method                                A sequential explorative mixed methods study including a stakeholder and expert workshop (                 N                 \,=\,21), expert interviews (                 N                 \,=\,14), an online survey (                 N                 \,=\,53) and a Datathon (                 N                 \,=\,80) was conducted with an emphasis on qualitative data.                                                        Results               Needs and application scenarios encompassed the micro- and meso-level of care and derived from typical phenomena inherent to nursing care as well as from skill- and staff mix and consequences arising from staff shortages, from the extend of informal care and an associated need for information and education of informal caregivers and nursing assistants. Requirements for and characteristics of successful research and development projects included regulatory, processual, technological, ethical and legal aspects and supportive eco-systems.                                         Conclusion               A key element in the design of research projects remains participatory and demand-driven development that aims to bring AI solutions out of the lab and into practice. However, influencing factors remain that are outside the sphere of influence of individual projects, in particular the creation of resilient legal foundations for data use and the use of AI in practice, standardization of data structures and the establishment of infrastructures for data exchange across institutions and projects.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The electronic patient record (EPR) has been introduced into nursing homes in order to facilitate documentation practices such as assessment and care planning, which play an integral role in the provision of dementia care. However, little is known about how the EPR facilitates or hinders these practices from the end-user's perspective. Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study was to explore the usability issues associated with the EPR for assessment and care planning for people with dementia in nursing homes from a staff perspective.                                         Methods                                An exploratory, qualitative research design with a multiple case study approach was used. Contextual Inquiry was carried out with a variety of staff members (                 n                 \,=\,21) who used the EPR in three nursing homes situated in Belgium, Czech Republic and Spain. Thematic analysis was used to code interview data, with codes then sorted into a priori components of the Health Information Technology Evaluation Framework: device, software functionality, organisational support. Two additional themes, structure and content, were also added.                                                        Results               Staff provided numerous examples of the ways in which EPR systems are facilitating and hindering assessment and care planning under each component, particularly for people with dementia, who may have more complex needs in comparison to other residents. The way in which EPR systems were not customisable was a common theme across all three homes. A comparison of organisational policies and practices revealed the importance of training, system support, and access, which may be linked with the successful adoption of the EPR system in nursing homes.                                         Conclusions               EPR systems introduced into the nursing home environment should be customisable and reflect best practice guidelines for dementia care, which may lead to improved outcomes and quality of life for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All levels of nursing home staff should be consulted during the development, implementation and evaluation of EPR systems as part of an iterative, user-centred design process.},

Business leaders are grappling with dysfunctional business models that are ill-equipped to manage the disruptive environment of growing artificial intelligence. Hence, this study examined the discontinuous shift in the scope and culture of business models by exploring interdisciplinary streams of literature. An integrative review methodology was used in this study to develop theoretical constructs relating to business model innovation in the services sector. Key propositions were an innovation continuum, a responsive business innovation model and value architecture, which inculcates a sustainable value creation proposition and market advantage. Businesses must continuously evolve on the high end of the innovation continuum to reduce the risk of innovation apathy and strategic myopia. A key contribution of this study was the interdependencies in value networks that allow for collaborative working and co-creation of resources, such as crowdsourcing, crowdworking and social media platforms. This study also showed the growing importance of a centre of excellence to function at the forefront of disruptive technologies. A key finding was the need for governance structures to recognise and manage the trade-offs between value drivers, which sometimes may conflict with societal benefits. The integrative review revealed that customer relationship management, global business services and artificial intelligence had not been unified in the extant literature, which makes this paper novel in its contribution to businesses struggling with or opposed to the digital revolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the absence of vision, visually impaired and blind people rely upon the tactile sense and hearing to obtain information about their surrounding environment. These senses cannot fully compensate for the absence of vision, so visually impaired and blind people experience difficulty with many tasks, including learning. This is particularly true of mathematical learning. Nowadays, technology provides many effective and affordable solutions to help visually impaired and blind people acquire mathematical skills. This paper is based upon a systematic review of technology-based mathematical learning solutions for visually impaired people and discusses the findings and objectives for technological improvements. It analyses the issues, challenges and limitations of existing techniques. We note that audio feedback, tactile displays, a supportive academic environment, digital textbooks and other forms of accessible math applications improve the quality of learning mathematics in visually impaired and blind people. Based on these findings, it is suggested that smartphone-based solutions could be more convenient and affordable than desktop/laptop-based solutions as a means to enhance mathematical learning. Additionally, future research directions are discussed, which may assist researchers to propose further solutions that will improve the quality of life for visually impaired and blind people.},

Authors used Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed to conduct a systematic review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Fully published economic articles in English were included. Methodology and reporting quality were assessed using standardized tools. Majority of studies (28/33) were on oncology procedures. Radical prostatectomy was the most reported procedure (16/33). Twenty-eight studies used quality-adjusted life years, and five used complication rates as outcomes. Nine used primary and 24 studies used secondary data. All studies used modeling. In 81\% of studies (27/33), RAS was cost-effective or potentially cost-effective compared to comparator procedures, including radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy. Societal perspective, longer-term time-horizon, and larger volumes favored RAS. Cost-drivers were length of stay and equipment cost. From societal and payer perspectives, robotic-assisted surgery is a cost-effective strategy for thoracic and abdominopelvic procedures.                            Clinical trial registration               This study is a systematic review with no intervention, not a clinical trial.},

Recognizing the processes of designing digitalized organizations as crucial for predicting the outcome of digitalization on workers and labor, extant research has developed an evolutionary ecosystem socio-technical (STS) perspective aimed at designing more human organizations in light of digital transformation. In this study we build upon the STS ecosystem analytical framework by Winby and Mohrman (2018), aiming to explore how the STS design principles, as proposed by said authors, are applied in three big manufacturing companies, in light of digitalization. Data collected through qualitative techniques has been analyzed abductively. Findings provide a detailed overview of how the STS ecosystem design principles are operationalized, and shed novel light on applied design methods, such as `agile' and `design thinking', able to support interconnection among systems, in a never-ending and iterative process. This study extends the existing ecosystem STS organization design conceptual model by exploring `how' we change, `who' the change is for, while also investigating `what' this means for the hitherto conceptualized STS work-system. Implication for management practice and ODC scholarship are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence (AI) offers much promise for improving healthcare. However, it runs the looming risk of causing individual and societal harms; for instance, exacerbating inequalities amongst minority groups, or enabling compromises in the confidentiality of patients' sensitive data. As such, there is an expanding, unmet need for ensuring AI for healthcare is developed in concordance with human values and ethics. Augmenting ``principle-based'' guidance that highlight adherence to ethical ideals (without necessarily offering translation into actionable practices), we offer a solution-based framework for operationalising ethics in AI for healthcare. Our framework is built from a scoping review of existing solutions of ethical AI guidelines, frameworks and technical solutions to address human values such as self-direction in healthcare. Our view spans the entire length of the AI lifecycle: data management, model development, deployment and monitoring. Our focus in this paper is to collate actionable solutions (whether technical or non-technical in nature), which can be steps that enable and empower developers in their daily practice to ensuring ethical practices in the broader picture. Our framework is intended to be adopted by AI developers, with recommendations that are accessible and driven by the existing literature. We endorse the recognised need for `ethical AI checklists' co-designed with health AI practitioners, which could further operationalise the technical solutions we have collated. Since the risks to health and wellbeing are so large, we believe a proactive approach is necessary for ensuring human values and ethics are appropriately respected in AI for healthcare.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To achieve carbon neutrality, integrating intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, necessitates the use of large-scale energy storage. Among various emerging energy storage technologies, redox flow batteries are particularly promising due to their good safety, scalability, and long cycle life. In order to meet the ever-growing market demand, it is essential to enhance the power density of battery stacks to lower the capital cost. One of the key components that impact the battery performance is the flow field, which is to distribute electrolytes onto electrodes. The design principle of flow fields is to maximize the distribution uniformity of electrolytes at a minimum pumping work. This review provides an overview of the progress and perspectives in flow field design and optimization, with an emphasis on the scale-up process. The methods used to evaluate the performance of flow fields, including both experimental and numerical techniques, are summarized, and the benefits of combining diverse methods are highlighted. The review then investigates the pattern design and structure optimization of serpentine- and interdigitated-based flow fields before discussing challenges and strategies for scaling up these flow fields. Finally, the remaining challenges and the prospects for designing highly efficient flow fields for battery stacks are outlined.},

However, their implementation in the university environment presents certain barriers that make it difficult. In this work, we study the feasibility of the teaching proposal of the management of this type of tools through a Project-Based Learning method in a distance learning environment. The methodology has been implemented transversally in two Master's degree subjects related to advanced design and manufacturing and has been carried out thanks to the operation of the product lifecycle management platform software by virtual machines. The practice has given very good pedagogical results in the work of skills related to the field of industrial design and manufacturing. The virtual system has demonstrated high efficiency and students have shown a satisfactory evolution in their professional training.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The topic of trust has attracted increasing interest within HRI research, and is particularly relevant in the context of social robots and their assistance of older people at home. To make this abstract concept of trust more tangible for developers of robotic technologies and to connect it with older people's living spaces and their daily practices, we propose a light-weight method drawing on elicitation cards to be used at early stages of participatory design. The cards were designed to serve as a guide for qualitative interviews at ideation phases. This was accomplished by using the cards connected to the living spaces of the participants, their daily practices, and `provocative' questions to structure conversations. We developed the method with 10 inexperienced interviewers who conducted 10 qualitative interviews on the topic of trust without cards, and who tested the cards with 10 older adults. Our findings indicate that the method served as a powerful facilitator of conversations around the topic of trust and enabled interviewers to engage with everyday practices of older adults; it also facilitated a more active role for older adults during the conversations. As indicators of findings that can come from the cards, salient trust-related themes that emerged from the analysis of card usage were the desire for control, companionship, privacy, understandability, and location-specific requirements with regards to trust.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ethical aspects in engineering design have become increasingly important in recent years. A typical example is the recent rise of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics. This paper applies user studies of a design support tool to empirically verify that our ethical framework improves the creativity of an engineer's design activity. The design support tool provides an environment for the promotion of ethical design perspectives and description. The experiments focus on two functionalities: semi-automatic generation and scenario path recommendation. These functions are designed around the application of ethical design theory, which extends the hierarchical representation of artifacts. Doing this enables users to reconsider their themes at the highest level of the hierarchy and to apply a wider conceptual space of design solutions. For example, by reconsidering the positions of their research themes in the space of the representation field, users can semi-automatically edit them and identify focal areas. Using the scenario path recommendation, designers can update their research themes after considering the ethical impacts of those themes on stakeholders. Both functions are realized by exploiting a knowledge base of ethical and technological discourses. Finally, the ethical design theory is updated based on some unexpected results of our user studies with regards to the cyclic relationship among theory, tools (i.e., experimental equipment), and observed data. For example, temporal dimensional aspects were confirmed as important.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Housing in informal settlements often lacks construction techniques that adopt criteria of resilience to natural hazards. Smartphones are rapidly diffusing in economically developing countries. The aim of this study was to assess the current use of smartphones by the masons of the informal settlements of Iringa, Tanzania, and to identify pathways for improving their construction practices. Data were collected through a mixed method approach that includes in-depth interviews, surveys, and a focus group with masons. The results reveal that only a few masons received formal training, most of them have never interacted with a qualified engineer nor consulted trained professionals when needed. Most masons own a smartphone and they extensively use it to gather technical information from the web, transfer money through mobile payments, share images of construction details, and promote their work on social media. The broad use of smartphones shows potential for enhancing construction quality. This article presents a unique analysis of the use of smartphones in the construction of informal settlements in Tanzania, which could be extended to other countries. Based on the findings, new strategies are proposed to engage with local stakeholders and foster the exchange of technical knowledge for safer settlements via smartphones.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion.                                         Methods               Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested.                                         Review findings               Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests ({$<$}\,80~years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests ({$>$}\,80~years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species' habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power.                                         Conclusions               Habitat preferences determine species' response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests ({$>$}\,80~years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia. Given that a broader set of biodiversity aspects are to be protected, best overall biodiversity impacts for a variety of species at landscape level can be achieved by ensuring that there is a mosaic of different forests within landscapes.},

While climate events are one of the many contributing drivers of conflict, feedback from conflict increases vulnerability, thereby creating conditions for a vicious cycle of conflict. In this study, we carry out a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, taking from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) dataset to documenting climate change adaptation occurring in 15 conflict-affected countries and compare the findings with records of climate adaptation finance flows and climate-related disasters in each country. Academic literature is sparse for most conflict-affected countries, and available studies tend to have a narrow focus, particularly on agriculture-related adaptation in rural contexts and adaptation by low-income actors. In contrast, multilateral and bilateral funding for climate change adaptation addresses a greater diversity of adaptation needs, including water systems, humanitarian programming, and urban areas. Even among the conflict-affected countries selected, we find disparity, with several countries being the focus of substantial research and funding, and others seeing little to none. Results indicate that people in conflict-affected contexts are adapting to climate change, but there is a pressing need for diverse scholarship across various sectors that documents a broader range of adaptation types and their results.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Our interest here lies in supporting important, but routine and time-consuming activities that underpin success in highly distributed, collaborative design and manufacturing environments; and how information structuring can facilitate this. To that end, we present a simple, yet powerful approach to team formation, partner selection, scheduling and communication that employs a different approach to the task of matching candidates to opportunities or partners to requirements (matchmaking): traditionally, this is approached using either an idea of `nearness' or `best fit' (metric-based paradigms); or by finding a subtree within a tree (data structure) (tree traversal). Instead, we prefer concept lattices to establish notions of `inclusion' or `membership': essentially, a topological paradigm. While our approach is substantive, it can be used alongside traditional approaches and in this way one could harness the strengths of multiple paradigms.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ethical and social concerns are a key obstacle to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the life sciences and beyond. The discussion of these issues has intensified in recent years and led to a number of approaches, tools and initiatives. Key amongst them is the idea of ex-ante impact assessments that aim to identify issues at the early stages of development. One prominent example of such ex-ante impact assessment is the European Union's (EU) Assessment list for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI). This article uses the findings of a large-scale application of the ALTAI to a large neuro-informatics project as an exemplar to demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the ALTAI in practice. The article shows that ex-ante impact assessment has the potential to help identify and address ethical and social issues. However, they need to be understood as part of a broader socio-technical ecosystem of AI. For ALTAI and related approaches to be useful in bio-medical research, they should be interpreted from a systems theory perspective which allows for their integration into the rich set of tools, legislation and approaches. The paper argues that ex-ante impact assessments have the best chance of being successful if seen applied in conjunction with other approaches in the context of the overall AI ecosystem.},

This paper discusses the prototype of a real-time multiplayer building platform as a video game developed for a first-year design studio impacted by pandemic-related teaching restrictions. The aim was to develop a methodology that enables first-year students to meet peers, build models collaboratively, and teach implicit design knowledge such as aesthetics and formal analysis while allowing individual creativity within the populous class. Through a combination of a step-by-step iterative design system and a real-time decentralized multi-player platform, students can work collaboratively on common digital designs. The design method is based upon building units and individualized strategies of aggregation and differentiation that are built up into larger structures. Special focus is paid to how new online platforms created for architecture education can migrate the advantages of physical intuitive design methods to a digital setting and eventually fill the gap of lacking implicit knowledge pedagogies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The principal focus of software product management is to ensure the economic success of the product, which means to prolong the product life as much as possible with modest expenditures to maximizs profits. Software product managers play an important role in the software development organization while being responsible for the strategy, business case, product roadmap, high-level requirements, product deployment (release-management), and retirement plan. This article explores the problems that affect the software product management process, their perceived frequency and perceived severity. The data were collected by a systematic literature review (5 main databases were analyzed), interviews (10 software product managers from IT companies), and surveys (89 participants). 95 software product management problems assigned nonexclusively to 7 areas were identified. 27 commonly mentioned software product management problems were evaluated for their perceived frequency and perceived severity. The problems perceived as the most frequent are: determining the true value of the product that the customer needs, strategy and priorities change frequently, technical debt, working in silos, and balancing between reactive and proactive work. In total, 95 problems have been identified which have been narrowed down to 27 problems based on their occurrence in at least 3 interviews. These selected problems were prioritized by perceived frequency and perceived severity. Some of the identified problems spanned beyond the software product management process itself, but they all affect the work of software product managers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             While digital health solutions continue to grow in number and in complexity, the ability for stakeholders in healthcare to easily discern quality lags far behind. This challenge is in part due to the lack of a transparent and standardized approach to validation. Evaluation of mobile health applications (apps) is further burdened by low barriers to development and direct-to-user marketing, leading to a crowded and confusing landscape. In this context, we investigated the pragmatic application of a previously described framework for digital health validation, the Digital Health Scorecard, in a cohort of 22 popular mobile health oncology apps. The apps evaluated using this framework performed poorly, scoring 49.4\% across all evaluation criteria as a group. Performance across component domains varied considerably with cost scoring highest at 100\%, usability at 56.7\%, technical at 37.3\%, and clinical at 15.9\%. satisfaction of prospectively determined end-user requirements derived from patient, family, and clinician consensus scored 37.2\%. While cost outperformed consistently and usability was adequate, the results also suggested that apps suffered from significant technical limitations, were of limited clinical value, and generally did not do what end users wanted. These large gaps further support the need for transparent and standardized evaluation to help all stakeholders in healthcare improve the quality of mobile health.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Insurance serves modern society and commerce by pooling risk to reduce the economic impact of disasters. Concurrently, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) scientists, responders and policymakers are co-developing               proactive               resilience and mitigation strategies with European citizens against accelerating climate-related natural catastrophes. The increasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes exacerbates the insurance coverage gap by incurring even greater losses for (re)insurers, leading to higher premiums in exchange for cover or the withdrawal of services entirely. This paper presents a conceptual framework for cross-sectoral collaboration between the insurance and DRM communities towards open, transparent and optimised disaster risk management for all EU citizens and businesses. Furthermore, this research identifies key enabling technologies (satellite, drone, artificial intelligence, blockchain) and novel risk transfer mechanisms with the potential to accelerate societal resilience to climate disasters through effective risk management. The study emphasises the critical role of the insurance industry in effective DRM and highlights where insurers could take a               more               active role across the temporal plane of a natural disaster by engaging in ex-ante interventions to protect those vulnerable to climate change-related risk.},

Among the main advantages mentioned is the potential possibility of creating individual ways of learning and teaching. The purpose of this article is to provide a description of the various approaches to adaptive learning, to present the comparative research results of a Polish-Ukrainian study, as well as to highlight the options offered by LMS Moodle (Modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment Learning Management System) for the implementation of adaptive learning and the possibility of taking into account the expectation of students regardless of the country. During the study, an online survey was administered to 59 students at the University of Silesia in Katowice (US), Poland and 121 students at the Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University (BGKU), Ukraine between March\textendash June 2020. All of the students were studying online due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19. The classes were conducted in synchronous and in asynchronous modes using e-learning courses in the Moodle system, as well as MS Teams for Polish students and Google Suite for Ukrainian students. At the same time, the majority of the surveyed students declared that they lack personalization, both in terms of materials and the learning process, which was limited in terms of fulfilment and they would like to have a choice of the level of study.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In supply chains where stakeholders belong to the economically disadvantaged segment and form an important part of the supply chain distribution, the complexities grow manifold. Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations. Our study has important implications to both developing markets and food supply chain practitioners as this paper tackles issues such as perishability, demand-supply mismatch, unfair prices, and quality related data transparency in the entire value chain.},

Specifically, we highlight the concept of sustainable development of materials and the need to broaden the range of stakeholders engaged in materials design decisions. For instance, beyond the traditional structure\textendash processing\textendash performance triangle, there is a critical need to incorporate sustainability metrics into materials design. Such metrics embrace concepts of green chemistry and chemicals management, critical materials and materials circularity, materials substitution and alternatives assessment. Implementation requires broad engagement beyond the traditional materials science and engineering boundaries, including global perspectives on public policy, governance, economics, and public health. Educational norms clearly must also change, together with workforce development programs and comprehensive industrial buy-in. This vision is further expanded upon in the articles in this issue, which we summarize here, providing highlights of each article and identifying critical intersections among the topics presented, thereby providing a framework to realize our vision.

This study systematically reviewed how research on ML teaching and learning in K-12 has fared, including the current area of focus, and the gaps that need to be addressed in the literature in future studies. We reviewed 43 conference and journal articles to analyze specific focus areas of ML learning and teaching in K-12 from four perspectives as derived from the data: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. The findings of our study reveal that (a) additional ML resources are needed for kindergarten to middle school and informal settings, (b) further studies need to be conducted on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most of the studies focus on pedagogical development with a dearth of teacher professional development programs, and (d) more evidence of societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. While this study recognizes the present gaps and direction for future research, these findings provide insight for educators, practitioners, instructional designers, and researchers into K-12 ML research trends to advance the quality of the emerging field.},

We developed and validated a six-dimension framework reflecting Internal Sustainability Efforts (ISEs), gathered more than 350K employee reviews of 104 major companies across the whole US for the (2008-2020) years, and developed a deep-learning framework scoring these reviews in terms of the six ISEs. Commitment to ISEs manifested itself at the micro-level\textemdash companies scoring high in ISEs enjoyed high stock growth. This new conceptualization of ISEs offers both theoretical implications for the literature on corporate sustainability and practical implications for companies and policy makers. To further explore these implications, researchers need to add potentially missing ISEs, to do so for more companies, and establish the causal relationship between company success and ISEs.},

Our study aimed to complement ethical principles considered relevant for the design of AI-assisted technology in health care with a context-specific conceptualization of the principles from the perspectives of individuals potentially affected by the implementation of AI technologies in nursing care. We conducted scenario-based semistructured interviews focusing on situations involving moral decision-making occurring in everyday nursing practice with nurses (               N               \,=\,15) and care recipients (               N               \,=\,13) working, respectively, living in long-term care facilities in Germany. First, we analyzed participants' concepts of the ethical principles beneficence, respect for autonomy and justice. Second, we investigated participants' expectations regarding the actualization of these concepts within the context of AI-assisted decision-making. The results underscore the importance of a~context-specific conceptualization of ethical principles for overcoming epistemic uncertainty regarding the risks and opportunities associated with the (non)fulfillment of these ethical principles. Moreover, our findings provide indications regarding which concepts of the investigated ethical principles ought to receive extra attention when designing AI technologies to ensure that these technologies incorporate the moral interests of stakeholders in the care sector.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster\texttrademark, a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy.                                         Methods               A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded.                                         Results                                The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (                 P                 = .03) and MBI (                 P                 = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (                 P                 = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were reported.                                                        Conclusions               The RehabMaster is a feasible and safe VR system for enhancing upper extremity function in patients with stroke.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study extends the previous research in which it has been shown that a mixed reality (MR) system fosters social interaction behaviours (SIBs) in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). When comparing this system to a LEGO-based non-digital intervention, it has been observed that an MR system effectively mediates a face-to-face play session between a child with ASC and a child without ASC providing new specific advantageous properties (e.g. not being a passive tool, not needing to be guided by the therapist). Considering the newly collected multimodal data totaling to 72 children (36 trials of dyads, child with ASC/child without ASC), a first goal of the present study is to apply detailed statistical inference and machine learning techniques to extensively evaluate the overall effect of this MR system, when compared to the LEGO condition. This goal also includes the analysis of psychophysiological data and allows the context-driven triangulation of the multimodal data which is operationalized by (i) video-coding of SIBs, (ii) psychophysiological data, and (iii) system logs of user-system events. A second goal is to show how SIBs, taking place in these experiences, are influenced by the internal states of the users and the system. SIBs were measured by video-coding overt behaviours (Initiation, Response and Externalization) and with self-reports. Internal states were measured using a wearable device designed by the FuBIntLab (Full-Body Interaction Lab) to acquire: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) data. Affective sliders and State Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaires were used as self-reports. Repeated-measures design was chosen with two conditions, the MR environment and the traditional therapy LEGO. The results show that the MR system has a positive effect on SIBs when compared to the LEGO condition, with an added advantage of being more flexible.},

However, few tools and processes exist for promoting dialogue among different interests and normative stances in knowledge co-creation. In this article, we build on the notion of thought collectives to argue that understanding and moderating normative tensions are necessary if sustainability science is to provide successful solutions. Drawing on an analysis of the normative tensions between rival high-tech and low-tech thought collectives in the mobility and food production sectors, we discuss three strategic approaches: applying common evaluative frameworks, building contextual convergence and embracing complexity. We argue that these strategies indicate a need to distinguish different kinds of reflexivity in managing tensions among thought collectives. As a practical conclusion, we establish sets of reflexive questions to help sustainability scientists deploy the knowledge management strategies discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper proposes to generate awareness for developing Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics by transferring knowledge from other fields of applied ethics, particularly from business ethics, stressing the role of organizations and processes of institutionalization. With the rapid development of AI systems in recent years, a new and thriving discourse on AI ethics has (re-)emerged, dealing primarily with ethical concepts, theories, and application contexts. We argue that business ethics insights may generate positive knowledge spillovers for AI ethics, given that debates on ethical and social responsibilities have been adopted as voluntary or mandatory regulations for organizations in both national and transnational contexts. Thus, business ethics may transfer knowledge from five core topics and concepts researched and institutionalized to AI ethics: (1) stakeholder management, (2) standardized reporting, (3) corporate governance and regulation, (4) curriculum accreditation, and as a unified topic (5) AI ethics washing derived from greenwashing. In outlining each of these five knowledge bridges, we illustrate current challenges in AI ethics and potential insights from business ethics that may advance the current debate. At the same time, we hold that business ethics can learn from AI ethics in catching up with the digital transformation, allowing for cross-fertilization between the two fields. Future debates in both disciplines of applied ethics may benefit from dialog and cross-fertilization, meant to strengthen the ethical depth and prevent ethics washing or, even worse, ethics bashing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In public health context, oncology is associated with severe negative impact on patients and on their relatives' quality of life. Over the last decades, survival has remained at 50\% worldwide for some tumor locations. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) assessment and, the corresponding use in clinical practice, help establishing patient individualized profiling involving caregivers. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine critical success factors for PROs assessment in daily clinical oncology practice. Additionally, we investigated how PROs collection can change oncology perspectives for patients and caregivers. According to PRISMA guidelines, 83 studies were included in this systematic review, whether related with implementation in daily clinical practice or associated with its use in oncology. PROs assessment gathers multi-professional teams, biomedical and clinical expertise, patients, families and caregivers. Institutional involvement, first line for caregiver's adherence, team continuous formation, encompassing training and support, design of clear workflows, continuous monitoring, and data analysis are crucial for implementation. PROs measures are decisive in oncology. Several items were improved, including caregiver\textendash patient\textendash physician communication, patient risk groups identification, unmet problems and needs detection, disease course and treatment tracking, prognostic markers, cost-effectiveness measurement and comfort/support provision for both patients and caregivers. Routine assessment and implementation of PROs in clinical practice are a major challenge and a paradigm transformation for future.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The Baltic Sea ecosystems supply many benefits to society, termed ecosystem services. These depend upon a healthy marine environment requiring marine and relevant land-based policies integrated with public health policies. Until recently marine environment protection policies have largely focussed on human impacts on the environment and have not taken into account impacts of ecosystems on human health beyond the direct impacts of hazardous substances, such as those present in seafood. Whilst endeavours have been made to integrate human health and well-being into marine policies, interviews with key stakeholders through a participatory process revealed that the linkages were not sufficiently strong to inform policymaking. The existing evidence base urgently needs to be identified and synthesised to support relevant policy updates of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) 2008/56/EC and the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) (2007) as well as to help direct future research priorities.                                         Method                                The protocol is based on the primary question, ``                 What linkages have been researched between Baltic Sea ecosystems and the positive and negative impacts to human health and well                 -                 being                 ?'' Using systematic mapping, this study will identify and map the state and the geographical distribution of the existing research evidence linking human health and well-being with the Baltic Sea ecosystems. The types of ecosystem services supplied by the Baltic Sea and the associated health and well-being impacts will be categorised and presented in a graphical matrix, illustrating ecosystem service type and the types of health and well-being outcomes. The systematic mapping procedure will result in a narrative report published with a searchable database, which will contain a descriptive summary of the information from all of the eligible studies. The systematic map and database will be displayed on the website of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).},

As the number of infections soared, and capabilities for testing lagged behind, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging became more relevant in the early diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In a few weeks, proposed new methods for lung screening using deep learning rapidly appeared, while quality assurance discussions lagged behind. This paper proposes a set of protocols to validate deep learning algorithms, including our ROI Hide-and-Seek protocol, which emphasizes or hides key regions of interest from CXR data. Our protocol allows assessing the classification performance for anomaly detection and its correlation to radiological signatures, an important issue overlooked in several deep learning approaches proposed so far. By running a set of systematic tests over CXR representations using public image datasets, we demonstrate the weaknesses of current techniques and offer perspectives on the advantages and limitations of automated radiography analysis when using heterogeneous data sources.},

While co-design has been proposed as a human-centred design approach for scaling AI and LA adoption, our understanding of how these design processes play out in real-life settings remains limited. This study is based on ethnographic fieldwork in primary and secondary schools and employs a relational materialist approach to trace, visualise, and analyse the increasingly complex and transformative relations between a growing number of actors. The findings shed light on the intricate ecosystem in which AI and LA are being introduced and on the marketisation of K-12 education. Instead of following a rational and sequential approach that can be easily executed, the co-design process emerged as a series of events, shifting from solely generating ideas with teachers to integrating and commercialising the LMS into a school market with an already high prevalence of educational technology (EdTech). AI and LA in education, co-design and data-driven schooling served as negotiating ideas               ,               boundary objects               , which maintained connectivity between actors, despite limited AI and LA implementation and the development of a stand-alone app. Even though teachers and students were actively involved in the design decisions, the co-design process did not lead to extensive adoption of the LMS nor did it sufficiently address the ethical issues related to the unrestricted collection of student data.},

However, the previous discussions on RRI have overlooked the economic dimension of innovation, which is encompassed by the perspective of Neo-Schumpeterian economics (N-SE). This paper aims to bridge the gap between the theories of responsible innovation (RI) and RRI and the underlying assumptions of N-SE. We seek to clarify the concept of responsible (research and) innovation \textemdash{} R(R)I. N-SE inherently recognizes the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including society and the public sector, as entrepreneurs driving and implementing innovation while assuming responsibility for its effects and consequences. In this respect, N-SE aligns with the responsible innovation concept discussed within the R(R)I framework. The paper addresses the fundamental question: What are the shared areas of interest between R(R)I and N-SE? This exploration enhances our understanding and facilitates the practical implementation of R(R)I in the context of N-SE, thereby promoting ethical, socially beneficial, and sustainable technological advancements.},

To this end, we conducted a mixed methods study of older adults' reactions to voice and body in a group conversation facilitation agent. Two agent forms with the same underlying artificial intelligence (AI) and voice system were compared: a humanoid robot and a voice assistant. One preliminary study (total n\,=\,24) and one experimental study comparing voice and body morphologies (n\,=\,36) were conducted with older adults and an experienced human facilitator. Findings revealed that the artificiality of the agent, regardless of its form, was beneficial for the socially uncomfortable task of conversation facilitation. Even so, talkative personality types had a poorer experience with the ``bodied'' robot version. Design implications and supplementary reactions, especially to agent voice, are also discussed.},

Technological innovations can play an important role in countering errant developments of the past and can support the transformation process towards a green economy in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. On the other hand, they pose challenges to the social control of technology and represent a methodical quandary known as the Collingridge dilemma. The core statement of the dilemma is that the implications of new technologies will only be fully visible once they are embedded in socio-economic-ecological systems when the possibilities to control diminish. The main objective of this study is thus to develop a monitoring framework enabling the ex ante assessment of related technological shifts and their implications for sustainable development.                                         Results               To approach the resulting difficulties for sustainability monitoring, digitization indicators should be accounted for in the German Sustainable Development Strategy. An enhanced strategy complemented by related Global Competitiveness Index 4.0 indicators, for which the Word Economic Forum assumes a modest link between competitiveness and inequality, illustrates the feasibility of linking research regarding the Fourth Industrial Revolution and sustainable development to measure its social and environmental consequences. The newly developed Sustainable Digital Socio-Economic-Ecological Indicator System categorizes the sustainability indicators into one index covering all Sustainable Development Goals along with four sub-indices emphasizing crucial aspects relevant to navigating a successful transformation. This novel and innovative approach is illustrated using the examples of Germany.                                         Conclusions               The Fourth Industrial Revolution is fundamentally driven by introducing renewable energy resources as a new energy regime. However, the effects extend beyond energy and necessitate comprehensive measurement frameworks for assessing sustainable development implications. This work contributes by analyzing the related impact on sustainable development and providing decision-makers with new insights for early recognition. Preliminary results for Germany expose a discrepancy between the status quo and the desired pathway, indicating emerging effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on inequality, employment, and education. While none of the sectors are sustainable, the sub-index analysis highlights distinct disparities among economic, social, and ecological sectors.},

Digital innovation hubs (DIHs), as ecosystems that provide technical knowhow, experimental skills, and specialist knowledge, are progressively gaining a strategic role in supporting such a transition, especially in European small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Several projects have been funded by the European Commission to support the growth and action of DIHs. However, which among the four main functionalities (networking, skills and training, test before investing, and access to funding) each DIH is capable of addressing in its daily support action to companies is still unclear. Thus, it is important to configure the service portfolios of DIHs (i.e. the set of services that each DIH can provide based on its characterising assets, knowledge, and capabilities). In this paper, the data-driven business\textendash ecosystem\textendash skills\textendash technology (D-BEST) reference model is proposed and then tested through a survey. The model triggers the identification and materialisation of service-based collaboration processes among DIHs based on their service portfolio analysis and supports the modelling of Collaborative Networks 4.0, in which DIHs are a strategic player because of their `by-design' innovation characteristics. Finally, through the extended adoption of the models developed by different emerging DIH networks, flexibility and interoperability can be reached, fostering the adoption of a unique digital platform to showcase and offer assets, triggering the creation of multiple inter- and intra-communications and collaborations among stakeholders belonging to the DIH ecosystems, and favouring the exchange and development of joint services.},

This research has developed a model to investigate the influence of TQM and I4.0 on SP. It also analyzes the mediating role of TQM in the relationship between I4.0 and SP. A survey was conducted among 240 respondents employed in ready-made garment (RMG) industries in Bangladesh. A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was used to analyze the collected data. Research findings show that both TQM and I4.0 technologies have a significant impact on the sustainable growth of the Bangladeshi RMG sector. Moreover, it is observed that TQM mediates the relationship between I4.0 and SP. The findings show that TQM helps to explain the relationship between I4.0 and sustainable performance. This study will provide a guideline for industrial executives on securing sustainability through the adoption of TQM concepts and I4.0 technologies. We are not aware of any additional studies that look at the possible link between TQM, I4.0, and SP, as well as the mediating role of TQM between I4.0 and SP.},

However, these AI Ethics Principles often fail to be actioned~in governmental~policy. This paper proposes a novel framework for the development of `Actionable Principles for AI'. The approach acknowledges the relevance of AI Ethics Principles and homes in on methodological elements to increase their practical implementability in policy processes. As a case study, elements are extracted from the development process of the               Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI               of the European Commission's ``High Level Expert Group on AI''. Subsequently,~these elements are expanded on and~evaluated in light of their ability to contribute to a prototype framework for the development of~'Actionable Principles for AI'. The paper proposes the~following three propositions for the~formation of such a prototype~framework: (1) preliminary landscape assessments; (2) multi-stakeholder participation and cross-sectoral feedback; and, (3) mechanisms to support implementation and operationalizability.},

Older adults are often presented with social robots designed based on developers' assumptions that only vaguely address their actual needs. By lacking an understanding of older adults' opinions of what technology should or could do for them\textendash and what it should not do\textendash we risk users of robots not finding them useful. Social and humanistic research on the robotization of care argues that it is important to prioritize user needs in technology design and implementation. Following this urgent call, we investigate older adults' experiences of and approach to social robots in their everyday lives. This is done empirically through a qualitative analysis of data collected from six group interviews on care robots with health care service users, informal caregivers (relatives), and professional caregivers (healthcare workers). Through this ``Need-Driven-Innovation'' study we argue that, to secure a functional and valuable technology-fit for the user, it is crucial to take older adults' wishes, fears, and desires about technology into account when implementing robots. It is also crucial to consider their wider networks of care, as the people in these networks also often interact with the assistive technology service users receive. Our study shows that more qualitative knowledge on the social aspect of human-robot interaction is needed to support future robot development and use in the health and care field and advocates for the crucial importance of strengthening the position of user-centered qualitative research in the field of social robotics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Cancer stage at diagnosis is essential for understanding cancer outcomes, guiding cancer control activities and healthcare services, and enabling benchmarking nationally and internationally. Yet, most cancer registries in Australia do not routinely collect this data. This study explored key stakeholders' perceptions of implementing cancer staging utilising Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms within the Western Australian Cancer Registry.                                         Methods                                Perceptions of key breast and colorectal cancer stakeholders, including registry staff, clinicians, consumers, data scientists, biostatisticians, data management, healthcare staff, and health researchers, were collected. Prospective and retrospective qualitative proformas at two-time points of the Western Australian Cancer Staging Project were employed. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to guide data collection, analysis and interpretation embedded in a Participatory Action Research approach. Data analysis also incorporated Framework Analysis and an adapted version of grading qualitative data using a visual                 traffic light labelling system                 to highlight the levels of positivity, negativity, and implementation concern.                                                        Results               Twenty-nine pre-proformas and 18 post-proformas were completed online via REDCap. The grading and visual presentation of barriers and enablers aided interpretation and reviewing predicted intervention outcomes. Of the selected constructs, complexity (the perceived difficulty of the intervention) was the strongest barrier and tension for change (the situation needing change) was the strongest enabler. Implementing cancer staging into the Western Australian Cancer Registry was considered vital. Benefits included improved knowledge and understanding of various outcomes (e.g., treatment received as per Optimum Care Pathways) and benchmarking. Barriers included compatibility issues with current systems/workflows, departmental/higher managerial support, and future sustainment.                                         Conclusions               The findings aid further review of data gaps, additional cancer streams, standardising cancer staging and future improvements. The study offers an adapted version of a rapid qualitative data collection and analytic approach for establishing barriers and enablers. The findings may also assist other population-based cancer registries considering collecting cancer stage at diagnosis.},

The object of disaster risk science research is the ``disaster system'' consisting of hazard, the geographical environment, and exposed units, with features of regionality, interconnectedness, coupling, and complexity. Environmental stability, hazard threat, and socioeconomic vulnerability together determine the way that disasters are formed, establish the spatial extent of disaster impact, and generate the scale of losses. In the formation of a disaster, a conducive environment is the prerequisite, a hazard is the necessary condition, and socioeconomic exposure is the sufficient condition. The geographical environment affects local hazard intensity and therefore can change the pattern of loss distribution. Regional multi-hazard, disaster chain, and disaster compound could induce complex impacts, amplifying or attenuating hazard intensity and changing the scope of affected areas. In the light of research progress, particularly in the context of China, we propose a three-layer disaster risk science disciplinary structure, which contains three pillars (disaster science, disaster technology, and disaster governance), nine core areas, and 27 research fields. Based on these elements, we discuss the frontiers in disaster risk science research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The pervasive presence and wide-ranging variety of artificial intelligence (AI) systems underscore the necessity for inclusivity and diversity in their design and implementation, to effectively address critical issues of fairness, trust, bias, and transparency. However, diversity and inclusion (D\&I) considerations are significantly neglected in AI systems design, development, and deployment. Ignoring D\&I in AI systems can cause digital redlining, discrimination, and algorithmic oppression, leading to AI systems being perceived as untrustworthy and unfair. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the challenges and their corresponding solutions (guidelines/ strategies/ approaches/ practices) about D\&I in AI and about the applications of AI for D\&I practices. Through a rigorous search and selection, 48 relevant academic papers published from 2017 to 2022 were identified. By applying open coding on the extracted data from the selected papers, we identified 55 unique challenges and 33 unique solutions in addressing D\&I in AI. We also identified 24 unique challenges and 23 unique solutions for enhancing D\&I practices by AI. The result of our analysis and synthesis of the selected studies contributes to a deeper understanding of diversity and inclusion issues and considerations in the design, development and deployment of the AI ecosystem. The findings would play an important role in enhancing awareness and attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners in their quest to embed D\&I principles and practices in future AI systems. This study also identifies important gaps in the research literature that will inspire future direction for researchers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The opportunity to automate and monitor the execution of legal contracts is gaining increasing interest in Business and Academia, thanks to the advent of smart contracts, blockchain technologies, and the Internet of Things. A critical issue in developing smart contract systems is the formalization of legal contracts, which are traditionally expressed in natural language with all the pitfalls that this entails. This paper presents a systematic literature review of papers for the main steps related to the transformation of a legal contract expressed in natural language into a formal specification. Key research studies have been identified, classified, and analyzed according to a four-step transformation process: (a) structural and semantic annotation to identify legal concepts in text, (b) identification of relationships among concepts, (c) contract domain modeling, and (d) generation of a formal specification. Each one of these steps poses serious research challenges that have been the subject of research for decades. The systematic review offers an overview of the most relevant research efforts undertaken to address each step and identifies promising approaches, best practices, and existing gaps in the literature.},

By incorporating stakeholder input early in the process, the final product is more likely to improve decision-making and effectively reduce kidney discard.                                         Recent Findings               Kidney discard is a complex problem that will require increased coordination between transplant stakeholders. An AI decision support system has significant potential, but there are challenges associated with overfitting, poor explainability, and inadequate trust. A transdisciplinary approach provides a holistic perspective that incorporates expertise from engineering, social science, and transplant healthcare. A systems approach leverages techniques for visualizing the system architecture to support solution design from multiple perspectives.                                         Summary               Developing a systems-based approach to AI decision support involves engaging in a cycle of documenting the system architecture, identifying pain points, developing prototypes, and validating the system. Early efforts have focused on describing process issues to prioritize tasks that would benefit from AI support.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Participatory methods for researching human\textendash environmental interactions seek detailed inputs on all manner of issues, but the outputs are often only understandable to the technically literate. On the other hand, participatory methods that involve the co-design of structured outputs (maps, models, games, stories, etc.) can be used to represent and integrate the knowledge and views of participants authentically and can be interpretable to both `scientist' and `non-scientist' alike, thereby creating `sideways' rather than top-down or bottom-up perspectives. This paper is both a methodological paper and a treatise that looks at some of the theory underpinning such approaches, drawing on the theory of citizen or `bottom-up' stakeholder engagement in science but also co-created engagement, emphasising the learning and trust-building benefits of this `sideways' engagement. It describes how some established and novel methods (participatory agent-based modelling; co-constructing computer games; and participatory social network mapping), can be used to engage stakeholders in iterative, constructivist communication, allowing researchers and stakeholders to co-create a structured `reality' separate from the reality it represents. We discuss how such approaches support and contribute to scientific outputs that better represent participants' reality. Our findings show that, when applied to ecosystem services, agricultural adaptation and disaster risk management, such representations provide communication opportunities and spaces for reflection and constructivist learning. The structured outputs allow stakeholders\textemdash both participant and researcher\textemdash to `mirror' their human-environmental system to collaboratively think about gaps and problems in understanding.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Despite the established evidence and theoretical advances explaining human judgments under uncertainty, developments of mobile health (mHealth) Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have not explicitly applied the psychology of decision making to the study of user needs. We report on a user needs approach to develop a prototype of a mHealth CDSS for Parkinson's disease (PD), which is theoretically grounded in the psychological literature about expert decision making and judgement under uncertainty.                                         Methods                                A suite of user needs studies was conducted in 4 European countries (Greece, Italy, Slovenia, the UK) prior to the development of PD\_Manager, a mHealth-based CDSS designed for Parkinson's disease, using wireless technology. Study 1 undertook Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) including elicitation of user needs, cognitive demands and perceived risks/benefits (ethical considerations) associated with the proposed CDSS, through structured interviews of prescribing clinicians (                 N                 \,=\,47). Study 2 carried out computational modelling of prescribing clinicians' (                 N                 \,=\,12) decision strategies based on social judgment theory. Study 3 was a vignette study of prescribing clinicians' (                 N                 \,=\,18) willingness to change treatment based on either self-reported symptoms data, devices-generated symptoms data or combinations of both.                                                        Results               Study 1 indicated that system development should move away from the traditional silos of `motor' and `non-motor' symptom evaluations and suggest that presenting data on symptoms according to goal-based domains would be the most beneficial approach, the most important being patients' overall Quality of Life (QoL). The computational modelling in Study 2 extrapolated different factor combinations when making judgements about different questions. Study 3 indicated that the clinicians were equally likely to change the care plan based on information about the change in the patient's condition from the patient's self-report and the wearable devices.                                         Conclusions               Based on our approach, we could formulate the following principles of mHealth design: 1) enabling shared decision making between the clinician, patient and the carer; 2) flexibility that accounts for diagnostic and treatment variation among clinicians; 3) monitoring of information integration from multiple sources. Our approach highlighted the central importance of the patient-clinician relationship in clinical decision making and the relevance of theoretical as opposed to algorithm (technology)-based modelling of human judgment.},

Concomitantly, digital twins may facilitate multi-party marine spatial planning. However, the potential of this emerging technology for such purposes is underexplored and yet to be realized, with just one notable project entitled European Digital Twins of the Ocean. Here, we consider the promise of digital twins for ocean sustainability across four thematic areas. We further emphasize implementation barriers, namely, data availability and quality, compatibility, and cost. Regarding oceanic data availability, we note the issues of spatial coverage, depth coverage, temporal resolution, and limited data sharing, underpinned, among other factors, by insufficient knowledge of marine processes. Inspired by the prospects of digital twins, and informed by impending difficulties, we propose to improve the availability and quality of data about the oceans, to take measures to ensure data standardization, and to prioritize implementation in areas of high conservation value by following the `nested enterprise' approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Authoritarian regimes' unrestricted collection of citizens' data might constitute an advantage regarding the development of some types of AI, and AI might facilitate authoritarian practices. This feedback loop challenges democracies. In a critical continuation of the Pentagon's Third Offset Strategy, I investigate a possible Democratic Offset regarding military applications of AI focussed on contestation, deliberation, and participation. I apply Landemore's Open Democracy, Hildebrandt's Agonistic Machine Learning, and Sharp's Civilian-Based Defence. Discussing value pluralism in AI ethics, I criticise parts of the literature for leaving the fundamental ethical incompatibility of democracies and authoritarian regimes unaddressed. I am focussing on the duty to disobey illegal orders derived from customary international humanitarian law (IHL) and the standard of `meaningful human control', which is central to the partially outdated debate about lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). I criticize the standard of `meaningful human control' following two pathways: First, the ethical and legal principles of just war theory and IHL should be implemented in military applications of AI to submit human commands to more control, in the sense of technological disaffordances. Second, the debate should focus on the societal circumstances for personal responsibility and disobedience to be trained and exerted in deliberation and participation related to military applications of AI, in the sense of societal affordances. In a larger picture, this includes multi-level stakeholder involvement, robust documentation to facilitate auditing, civilian-based defence in decentralized smart cities, and open-source intelligence. This multi-layered approach fosters cognitive diversity, which might constitute a strategic advantage for democracies regarding AI.},

This form of experimentation is claimed to be enhanced by digital tools as well as being an enabler of production of credible, salient, and legitimate science insofar as it embraces a farmer-centric perspective. However, the forms of research in which some experimental activities on farms are anchored vary greatly, notably with regard to the actual forms that interventions on farms take, the legitimacy of the actors involved and their roles, or the observations and instruments applied for interpretation. We propose a systematic review of the literature and an analytical framework in order to better understand this diversity of practices behind on-farm experimentation. Our analysis segregated six major publication clusters based on themes appearing in titles and abstracts. These themes guided a more in-depth analysis of representative articles, from which we identified seven types of OFE practices that are described and discussed here with regard to the knowledge targeted, roles of the various actors, and on-farm experimental space. Our typology provides an original basis for supporting reflexivity and building alignment between the above-mentioned dimensions and the ways in which new tools can support the experimental process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Circular supply chain management (CSCM) is a promising way to achieve economic and environmental sustainability and address the waste problem. However, developing a fully circular supply chain system is costly and time-consuming, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs need to achieve better CSCM by implementing waste management practices. This study aims to (1) critically validate the hierarchical structure of CSCM for SMEs; (2) identify the causal interrelationships among the attributes; and (3) determine the practical attributes for SME improvement in Indonesia. An approach consisting of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), best worse method (BWM), and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is designed to fulfill the objectives of this study. The results show the hierarchical structure in CSCM implementation that benefit SMEs through performance improvement gains. Waste management practices and circular product design are causal aspects; in particular, waste management practices support SMEs in building CSCM as an alternative. The criteria to provide practical insights for CSCM in Indonesia are eco-design, sustainable product design, green technology, waste treatment capability, and designing for the environment.},

However, much of the current research examining learning in makerspaces neglects the perspectives of educators. This not only hinders our understanding of educators' goals and how educators navigate makerspaces but also constrains how we frame the design space of the learning experiences and environments. To address this, we engaged in a set of semi-structured interviews to examine the contexts, goals, values, and practices of seven educators across five makerspaces. A thematic analysis of the data identified six key categories of competencies that these educators prioritize including a range of skills, practices, and knowledge, such as technical proficiency, communication, and contextual reflection. The analysis also identified five categories of strategies to accomplish certain goals, such as scaffolding, collaboration, and relationship building. Last, it also shed light on three categories of challenges faced at the student-level, teacher-level, and institutional level. We conclude with a discussion on our insights into how we can broaden the problem space in the design of educational technologies to support learning in makerspaces.},

  abstract = {Abstract             With recent advancements in systems engineering and artificial intelligence, autonomous agents are increasingly being called upon to execute tasks that have normative relevance. These are tasks that directly\textemdash and potentially adversely\textemdash affect human well-being and demand of the agent a degree of normative-sensitivity and -compliance. Such norms and normative principles are typically of a social, legal, ethical, empathetic, or cultural (`SLEEC') nature. Whereas norms of this type are often framed in the abstract, or as high-level principles, addressing normative concerns in concrete applications of autonomous agents requires the refinement of normative principles into explicitly formulated practical rules. This paper develops a process for deriving specification rules from a set of high-level norms, thereby bridging the gap between normative principles and operational practice. This enables autonomous agents to select and execute the most normatively favourable action in the intended context premised on a range of underlying relevant normative principles. In the translation and reduction of normative principles to SLEEC rules, we present an iterative process that uncovers normative principles, addresses SLEEC concerns, identifies and resolves SLEEC conflicts, and generates both preliminary and complex normatively-relevant rules, thereby guiding the development of autonomous agents and better positioning them as normatively SLEEC-sensitive or SLEEC-compliant.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Information and Communication Technology can turn older adults' homes into smart living environments, decreasing the need for support and improving life quality. However, new technology has high uncertainty in terms of acceptance. Co-creation approaches are proposed to reach high acceptability, usability and satisfaction, but performance evaluations are sparse. This paper aimed at presenting the evaluation of a hybrid approach of Agile co-creation framework, specially designed for large, distributed consortia and cross-national collaborations.             The new framework, leveraging the concepts of Design Thinking, Lean start-up, and SCRUM Agile, was tested in the H2020 CAPTAIN project. A network of stakeholders, built across five Living Labs, allowed the participatory design of the CATAIN technology through multiple iterations. A pre-post assessment questionnaire was administered to team components and used to compare partners' perspective and satisfaction about CAPTAIN`s and other projects methodologies. A longitudinal assessment throughout the iterations, using actionable metrics, monitored team morale and stakeholders' engagement and satisfaction.             The CAPTAIN development process resulted in a stronger involvement of the partners and a in better perception of requirements elicitation, design and development process than previous projects. Team morale was good and steady along the development iterations. Stakeholders increased from 91 to 132 along the iterations and more than 90\% were satisfied.             The tested framework went beyond usual participatory designs. It required stronger technical coordination, activity planning and communication among technical and pilot partners, but resulted in high satisfaction and engagement of both team members and stakeholders, showing its validity as a development approach for H2020 projects.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               An extensive body of literature in the field of agro-ecology claims to show the positive effects that maintenance of ecosystem services can have on sustainably meeting future food demand, by making farms more productive and resilient, and contributing to better nutrition and livelihoods of farmers. In Africa alone, some research has estimated a two-fold yield increase if food producers capitalize on new and existing knowledge from science and technology. Site-specific strategies adopted with the aim of improving ecosystem services may incorporate principles of multifunctional agriculture, sustainable intensification and conservation agriculture. However, a coherent synthesis and review of the evidence of these claims is largely absent, and the quality of much of this literature is questionable. Moreover, inconsistent effects have commonly been reported, while empirical evidence to support assumed improvements is largely lacking.                                         Objectives               This systematic map is stimulated by an interest to (1) collate evidence on the effectiveness of on-farm conservation land management for preserving and enhancing ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, by drawing together the currently fragmented and multidisciplinary literature base, and (2) geographically map what indicators have been used to assess on-farm conservation land management. For both questions, we will focus on 74 low-income and developing countries, where much of the world's agricultural expansion is occurring, yet 80\% of arable land is already used and croplands are yielding well below their potential.                                         Methods/Design               To this end, reviewers will systematically search bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research from Web of Science, SCOPUS, AGRICOLA, AGRIS databases and CAB abstracts, and grey literature from Google Scholar, and 22 subject-specific or institutional websites. Boolean search operators will be used to create search strings where applicable. Ecosystem services included in the study are pollination services; pest-, carbon-, soil-, and water-regulation; nutrient cycling; medicinal and aromatic plants; fuel wood and cultural services. Outputs of the systematic map will include a database, technical report and an online interactive map, searchable by topic. The results of this map are expected to provide clarity about synergistic outcomes of conservation land management, which will help support local decision-making.},

There are many benefits to care robots but they also pose many challenging ethical issues. This paper takes care robots for the elderly as the subject of analysis, building on previous literature in the domain of the ethics and design of care robots. Using the value sensitive design (VSD) approach to technology design, this paper extends its application to care robots by integrating the values of care, values that are specific to AI, and higher-scale values such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The ethical issues specific to care robots for the elderly are discussed at length alongside examples of specific design requirements that work to ameliorate these ethical concerns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Value sensitive design (VSD) is an established method for integrating values into technical design. It has been applied to different technologies and, more recently, to artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that AI poses a number of challenges specific to VSD that require a somewhat modified VSD approach. Machine learning (ML), in particular, poses two challenges. First, humans may not understand how an AI system learns certain things. This requires paying attention to values such as transparency, explicability, and accountability. Second, ML may lead to AI systems adapting in ways that `disembody' the values embedded in them. To address this, we propose a threefold modified VSD approach: (1) integrating a known set of VSD principles (AI4SG) as design norms from which more specific design requirements can be derived; (2) distinguishing between values that are promoted and respected by the design to ensure outcomes that not only do no harm but also contribute to good, and (3) extending the VSD process to encompass the whole life cycle of an AI technology to monitor unintended value consequences and redesign as needed. We illustrate our VSD for AI approach with an example use case of a SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing app.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            One of the primary, if not most critical, difficulties in the design and implementation of autonomous systems is the black-boxed nature of the decision-making structures and logical pathways. How human values are embodied and actualised in situ may ultimately prove to be harmful if not outright recalcitrant. For this reason, the values of stakeholders become of particular significance given the risks posed by opaque structures of intelligent agents. This paper explores how decision matrix algorithms, via the               belief-desire-intention               model for autonomous vehicles, can be designed to minimize the risks of opaque architectures. Primarily through an explicit orientation towards designing               for               the values of explainability and verifiability. In doing so, this research adopts the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as a principled framework for the incorporation of such values within design. VSD is recognized as a potential starting point that offers a systematic way for engineering teams to formally incorporate existing technical solutions within ethical design, while simultaneously remaining pliable to emerging issues and needs. It is concluded that the VSD methodology offers at least a strong enough foundation from which designers can begin to anticipate design needs and formulate salient design flows that can be adapted to the changing ethical landscapes required for utilisation in autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Invasive alien species (IAS) pose a key threat to biodiversity, the economy and human well-being, and continue to increase in abundance and impact worldwide. Legislation and policy currently dominate the global agenda for IAS, although translation to localised success may be limited. This calls for a wider range of responses to transform IAS management. An under-appreciated strategy to achieve success may come from bottom-up, experimental innovations (so-called ``seeds''), which offer alternative visions of what may be possible for IAS management in the future. We present an application of a participatory process that builds on such innovations to create alternative visions of the future, with actionable pathways to guide change. Through a series of workshops with practitioners and academics, we used this process to explore alternative positive futures for IAS management in South Africa. We then identified a set of domains of change, that could enable these visions to be actioned by appropriate stakeholders. The domains of change highlight the social\textendash ecological nature of the IAS sector, with interconnected actions needed in financial, cultural, social, technological and governance spheres. Key domains identified were the need to shift mindsets and values of society regarding IAS, as well as the need for appropriate and functional financing. This participatory futuring process offers a way to interrogate and scale bottom-up innovations, thereby creating optimism and allowing stakeholders to engage constructively with the future. This represents an important step in fostering the potential of bottom-up innovations to transform IAS management.},

Looking at the current status of the BBE, we observe a dominant focus on technological innovation as the principal solution to climatic instability. We take a critical stance towards this ``ecomodernist'' worldview, addressing its fundamental assumptions, and offer an underarticulated explanation as to why a successful transition toward a sustainable BBE\textemdash i.e. one that fully operates within the Earth's carrying capacity\textemdash has not yet been reached. Bernard Stiegler has developed a philosophical perspective on the concept of economy, broadening it to include the human condition through the notion of desire. This theory can help to obtain a more profound understanding of why ecomodernist strategies are dominant today. Stiegler's theory of the libidinal economy offers an analysis of controlled and exploited human desire as a primary driver behind modern techno-economic structures. Our hypothesis is that a critique of contemporary technofixism               as               a critique of libidinal economy is a necessary step to take in the discussion around the BBE as a concept, if the BBE is ever to bring about a system that can truly operate within the Earth's carrying capacity.},

For instance, information displayed in trains, as well as on departure boards in train stations and on platforms, are often not available in acoustic or tactile form. Digital technologies, such as smartphones or smartwatches, can provide an alternative means of access. However, these alternatives do not guarantee that the user experience is comparable in value, quality and efficiency. The present case study details a participatory design process, where travellers with visual impairments co-designed a mobile app. The goal was to tackle information gaps on journeys by public transport and to learn how participatory design can facilitate the provision of comparable experiences for users with disabilities. Travellers with visual impairments were involved in a collaborative process in all project phases, including problem identification, technical feasibility, proof of concept, design and development. Participatory design contributed to a thorough understanding of the user perspective and allowed the app to be optimised for the needs of travellers with visual impairments. Furthermore, co-design proved to be an effective method for fostering awareness and knowledge about digital accessibility at all organisational levels.},

The process aimed to support reflection and shape the future of the clinic's ongoing social innovation and to transform institutional public health services. Positioning the work of solidarity movement as designing social innovation, the work contributes to CSCW and `infrastructuring' in Participatory Design aspiring to support social activism and social transformation processes. More specifically, through our empirical insights on the process of infrastructuring an oral history group within a social movement; and related insights about their ongoing participatory health service provision\textemdash we provide implications for CSCW concerned with its role in institutional healthcare service transformation.},

In addition to financial capital, the integrated report includes material information about manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relational, and natural capitals. Although there has been a steady growth in empirical IR research, there is\textemdash as yet\textemdash no literature review on the business case for IR. Thus, the purpose of this study is to convey a detailed understanding of the governance-, (non) financial performance-, and reporting-related determinants of IR and its contribution to firm value in line with the business case argument. To do so, we selected 85 quantitative peer-reviewed archival studies on that topic. We have then differentiated said studies between those that focus on IR adoption versus those that focus on IR quality, with a legitimacy- and stakeholder-theory-based framework. This differentiation is crucial, to stress the challenges of greenwashing policies and information overload. Here, in contrast to former literature reviews on IR, we provide new insights into this emerging research topic and concentrate on archival IR research. We are also interested in recent moderator- and mediator analysis in archival IR research since the business case argument for IR may require a specific environment, in addition to the main variables we have included. We likewise give a detailed overview of included variables and proxies and compare their main statistical effects. Our literature review demonstrates that (1) board composition and (2) stakeholder pressure positively influence IR quality; whereas (3) (non) financial performance leads to increased IR adoption and quality. We also find that both IR adoption and IR quality are linked with positive consequences on firm valuation, as they lead to higher total performance measures. Last but not least, this analysis includes useful recommendations for future IR research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Current developments in fields such as quantum physics, fine arts, robotics, cognitive sciences or defense and security indicate the emergence of creative systems capable of producing new and innovative solutions through combinations of machine learning algorithms. These systems, called machine invention systems, challenge the established invention paradigm in promising the automation of \textendash{} at least parts of \textendash{} the innovation process. This paper's main contribution is twofold. Based on the identified state-of-the-art examples in the above mentioned~fields, key components for machine invention systems and their relations are identified, creating a conceptual model as well as proposing a working definition for machine invention systems. The differences and delimitations to other concepts in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, such as machine discovery systems are discussed as well. Furthermore, the paper briefly addresses the social and societal implications and limitations that come with the adoption of the technology. Because of their revolutionizing potential, there are widespread implications to consider from ethical and moral implications to policymaking and societal changes, like changes in the job structure. The discussion part approaches some of these implications, as well as solutions to some of the proposed challenges. The paper concludes by discussing some of the systemic benefits that can be accessed through machine invention.},

Researchers have suggested two main approaches for the overall measurement of well-being, the objective and the subjective well-being. Both approaches, as well as their relevant dimensions, have been traditionally captured with surveys. During the last decades, new data sources have been suggested as an alternative or complement to traditional data. This paper aims to present the theoretical background of well-being, by distinguishing between objective and subjective approaches, their relevant dimensions, the new data sources used for their measurement and relevant studies. We also intend to shed light on still barely unexplored dimensions and data sources that could potentially contribute as a key for public policing and social development.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The Republic of Serbia (RS) is strategically oriented towards sustainable development, but the implementation thereof faces different limitations and problems. RS emits substantial pollution caused by fossil fuels, and pollution from agricultural sector characterized by inefficient use of energy and intensive use of fertilizers. Bearing in mind the significant agricultural capacities and the orientation towards rural development, a special green transformation must be implemented in this domain. Taking into account the specificities and tradition, the introduction of the circularity concept can be considered the most acceptable. Research on readiness for transition to circularity in RS rural areas has not been conducted; therefore, the goal of the paper is to develop a concept for assessing the capacity of rural areas for circularity. This study is the first scientific proposal that aims to provide input for policymakers, thus contributing to the creation of a new identity of RS, whose development is based on the principles of sustainability.                                         Methods               The study was conducted as conceptual research, with the objective of examining an undiscovered phenomenon without empirical evidence and incorporating the targeted phenomenon into a conceptual framework, while providing a proposal for a solution model based on an interdisciplinary approach\textemdash the application of qualitative and quantitative methods (aggregation of composite indicators and Delphi method).                                         Results               Paper results can be summarized as follows: (a) qualitative analysis of policy framework related to RS transition towards circularity (which shows that regulation is insufficient or non-existent, so conceptual research at this stage is necessary and only possible); (b) research questionnaire; (c) original set of indicators for measuring capacity for circularity (derived from the questionnaire); (d) concept of index of capacity of agriculture and rural areas for circularity (based on a set of indicators); and (e) concept of the monitoring of circularity implementation.                                         Conclusions               The main research findings presented in this paper could be beneficial for countries at early stages of introducing circularity, having both low and high agricultural potential. With slight modifications, they can also be applied to other economic activities.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Uncovering patterns and trends in vast, ever-increasing quantities of data has been enabled by different machine learning methods and techniques used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Permeating many aspects of our lives and influencing our choices, development in this field continues to advance and increasingly impacts us as individuals and our society. The risks and unintended effects such as bias from input data or algorithm design have recently stirred discourse about how to inform and teach AI in K-12 education. As AI is a new topic not only for pupils in K-12 but also for teachers, new skill sets are required that enable critical engagement with AI. AI literacy is trying to close the gap between research and practical knowledge transfer of AI-related skills. Teachers' AI-related technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) are important factors for AI literacy. However, as teachers' perspectives, beliefs and views impact both the interpretation and operationalisation of curriculum. this study explores teachers' and teacher educators' understanding and preconceptions of AI to inform teacher education and professional development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of teachers' conceptualisations regarding AI an anonymous questionnaire together with focus group discussions were employed. The qualitative content analysis underpinned by the theoretical framework Intelligent TPACK reveals that teachers' AI-related content knowledge is generally gained through incidental learning and often results in pre- and misconceptions of AI. Our analysis also revealed several potential challenges for teachers in achieving core constructs of Intelligent TPACK, examples of such challenges are vague and unclear guidelines in both policy and curriculum, a lack of understanding of AI and its limitations, as well as emotional responses related to participants' preconceptions. These insights are important to consider in designing teacher education and professional development related to AI literacy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             While VR adaptations of the mnemonic Method of Loci (or the `Memory Palace' technique) show promising results in increasing mnemonic capabilities, little to no research has explored the use and integration of Virtual Memory Palaces over time in a context of self-initiated studying. To explore the use of Virtual Memory Palaces (VMPs) contextually, we conducted an in-the-wild study where we gave ten participants a VR Head-Mounted Display through which they could access and furnish their VMP over eight weeks. We conducted go-along interviews in our participants' VMPs at various intervals throughout the eight-week study, exploring their creations and querying them about their experience. Based on our findings, this article discusses individual and contextual factors that come into play when a VMP is approached as a personal project in the midst of an already-established study routine. We frame our study as a postphenomenological inquiry into the mediating effects of VMPs, where our primary interest lies in what relationship the students developed to the VMP.},

To support this position, we examine the role and value of grand challenge efforts in science and engineering based on a theory of grand challenges as socially constructed boundary objects.

  abstract = {Abstract             When operating a conditionally automated vehicle, humans occasionally have to take over control. If the driver is out of the loop, a certain amount of time is necessary to gain situation awareness. This work evaluates the potential of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) dashboards for presenting smart S3D take-over-requests (TORs) to support situation assessment. In a driving simulator study with a 4 \texttimes{} 2 between-within design, we presented 3 smart TORs showing the current traffic situation and a baseline TOR in 2D and S3D to 52 participants doing the n-back task. We further investigate if non-standard locations affect the results. Take-over performance indicates that participants looked at and processed the TORs' visual information and by that, could perform more safe take-overs. S3D warnings in general, as well as warnings appearing at the participants' focus of attention and warnings at the instrument cluster, performed best. We conclude that visual warnings, presented on an S3D dashboard, can be a valid option to support take-over while not increasing workload. We further discuss participants' gaze behavior in the context of visual warnings for automotive user interfaces.},

  abstract = {Abstract             While virtual reality (VR) has been explored in the field of architecture, its implications on people who experience their future office space in such a way has not been extensively studied. In this explorative study, we are interested in how VR and other representation methods support users in projecting themselves into their future office space and how this might influence their willingness to relocate. In order to compare VR with other representations, we used (i) standard paper based floor plans and renders of the future building (as used by architects to present their creations to stakeholders), (ii) a highly-detailed virtual environment of the same building experienced on a computer monitor (desktop condition), and (iii) the same environment experienced on a head mounted display (VR condition). Participants were randomly assigned to conditions and were instructed to freely explore their representation method for up to 15 min without any restrictions or tasks given. The results show, that compared to other representation methods, VR significantly differed for the sense of presence, user experience and engagement, and that these measures are correlated for this condition only. In virtual environments, users were observed looking at the views through the windows, spent time on terraces between trees, explored the surroundings, and even ``took a walk'' to work. Nevertheless, the results show that representation method influences the exploration of the future building as users in VR spent significantly more time exploring the environment, and provided more positive comments about the building compared to users in either desktop or paper conditions. We show that VR representation used in our explorative study increased users' capability to imagine future scenarios involving their future office spaces, better supported them in projecting themselves into these spaces, and positively affected their attitude towards relocating.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cost-effective on-demand computing resources can help to process the increasing number of large, diverse datasets generated from smart internet-enabled technology, such as sensors, CCTV cameras, and mobile devices, with high temporal resolution. Category 1 emergency services (Ambulance, Fire and Rescue, and Police) can benefit from access to (near) real-time traffic- and weather data to coordinate multiple services, such as reassessing a route on the transport network affected by flooding or road incidents. However, there is a tendency not to utilise available smart city data sources, due to the heterogeneous data landscape, lack of real-time information, and communication inefficiencies. Using a systems engineering approach, we identify the current challenges faced by stakeholders involved in incident response and formulate future requirements for an improved system. Based on these initial findings, we develop a use case using Microsoft Azure cloud computing technology for analytical functionalities that can better support stakeholders in their response to an incident. Our prototype allows stakeholders to view available resources, send automatic updates and integrate location-based real-time weather and traffic data. We anticipate our study will provide a foundation for the future design of a data ontology for multi-agency incident response in smart cities of the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This work presents our approach to formally model the Swiftaid system design, a digital platform that enables donors to automatically add Gift Aid to donations made via card payments. Following principles of Behaviour-Driven Development, we use Gherkin to capture requirements specified in legislation, specifically the UK Charity (Gift Aid Declarations) Regulations 2016. The Gherkin scenarios provide a basis for subsequent formal modelling and analysis using Event-B, Rodin and ProB. Interactive model simulations assist communication between domain experts, software architects and other stakeholders during requirements capture and system design, enabling the emergent system behaviour to be validated. Our approach was employed within the development of the real Swiftaid product, launched by Streeva in February 2019. Our analysis helped conclude that there was not a strong enough business case for one of the features, whichwas shown to provide nominal user convenience at the expense of increased complexity. This work provides a case study in allying formal and agile software development to enable rapid development of robust software.},

Recent Findings               Both general ethical challenges associated with robot deployment and those specific to human-robot interaction are addressed and complemented by discussions of ethics within HRI research, ethics related behavior towards robots, as well as ethics and robot rights. Moreover, we discuss ethical challenges in sensitive contexts such as medicine, rehabilitation, and care. We conclude our review by providing an overview of the key ethics frameworks and guidelines to inspire researchers, developers, and stakeholders alike.                                         Summary               This review offers a timely overview of the state-of-the art societal and ethical issues that arise from the ever more steady integration of robots into human society. We exemplify the key issues and debates in the field by mainly covering the literature of the past five~years.},

This paper aims to describe how gamification is adopted in the context of transportation.                                         Methods               We performed a systematic mapping of the scientific literature of Web of Science and retrieved 211 studies. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 66 studies were selected. After the full texts were read, 30 studies remained to be analysed.                                         Findings               The results show that the most commonly used gamification elements are goals/challenges and points. Gamification provides support for outcomes such as changing travel behaviour, improving driving behaviour and encouraging bicycle commuting. The use of gamification has changed the behavior of travelers, promoted sustainable travel modes, encouraged safe driving, reduced carbon dioxide emissions and reduced energy consumption. Although gamification has achieved many positive results related to transportation, there are still many difficulties and challenges.},

A fifth wave may come from the potential from AI, machine learning and Big Data. Each successive wave has built on the last, and together they comprise the supply side of the evidence architecture. To support the use of evidence demand side activities such as Evidence Needs Assessments and Use of Evidence Awards are proposed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The interest in advanced robotic equipment in construction has increased in recent years. However, actual industry adoption lags behind\textemdash and fundamental considerations might be at fault. To date, little scholarship in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) addresses the stakeholder perception of construction robot design. Therefore, we ask, ``How do visual attributes of a construction robot influence the perception of AEC stakeholders?'' To conduct our study, we performed a bibliometric analysis on a corpus of 59 scholarly research articles, 5 expert interviews and created and pre-validated a robot database of 50 robot pictures classified on their visual attributes of morphology, color and material. As a result, we present a study with 161 construction professionals who judged these robots based on three visual main criteria: ease of use, work task adaptability and risk of job loss. In total, more than 6500 data points are collected and analyzed using binary logistic regression. The five key findings are that construction professionals perceive that: (1) Zoomorphic (animal-like) robots are easier to use than anthropomorphic (human-like) or mechanomorphic (machine-like) robots, (2) Bright robots are easier to use than dark robots, (3) Zoomorphic and anthropomorphic robots are more multifunctional than mechanomorphic robots, (4) Anthropomorphic and mechanomorphic robots are more of a risk to job loss than zoomorphic robots, and (5) Dark robots are more of a risk to job loss than bright ones. These results are important for academics and practitioners that aim to increase the likelihood of positive stakeholder perception of robots in construction. The findings can further help to develop specific user-centered design principles. Such implementation can reduce the risk of construction professionals rejecting future robots when they are introduced at the AEC job site.},

In particular, individuals with intellectual disabilities participated in a co-design process via a series of workshops and focus groups to design tangible interfaces for mental wellbeing as their wellbeing challenges are often diagnostically overshadowed. The workshops helped participants explore new technologies, including sensors and feedback mechanisms that can help monitor and potentially improve mental wellbeing. The adopted co-design approach resulted in a range of effective and suitable interfaces being developed for varying ages.},

However, too often, the buzz about worker well-being, enthusiasm for new programs to promote it and interest to research it, have not been accompanied by universal enthusiasm for scientific measurement. Aim to bridge this gap, we address three questions. To address the question `What is worker well-being?', we explain that worker well-being is a multi-facetted concept and that it can be operationalized in a variety of constructs. We propose a four-dimensional taxonomy of worker well-being constructs to illustrate the concept's complexity and classify ten constructs within this taxonomy. To answer the question `How can worker well-being constructs be measured?', we present two aspects of measures: measure obtrusiveness (i.e., the extent to which obtaining a measure interferes with workers' experiences) and measure type (i.e., closed question survey, word, behavioral and physiological). We illustrate the diversity of measures across our taxonomy and uncover some hitherto under-appreciated avenues for measuring worker well-being. Finally, we address the question `How should a worker well-being measure be selected?' by discussing conceptual, methodological, practical and ethical considerations when selecting a measure. We summarize these considerations in a short checklist. It is our hope that with this study researchers \textendash{} working in organizations, in academia or both \textendash{} will feel more competent to find effective strategies for the measurement worker well-being and eventually make policies and choices with a better understanding of what drives worker well-being.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Thirteen essential maternal child health (MCH) commodities, identified by the UN Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children, could save the lives of more than 6 million women and children in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) if made available at the point of care. To reduce stockout of those commodities and improve the health supply chains in LMICs, the Electronic TRAcking system for healthcare commodities (E+TRA Health), an all-in-one out-of-box solution, was developed to track and manage medical commodities at lower-level health facilities in rural areas. It aims to support real-time monitoring and decision-making to (1) reduce the time needed to prepare orders, (2) reduce stockout and overstock cases of targeted medical supplies, (3) help improve patient outcomes. In this study, we adopted an integrated approach to analyze the process of information flow, identify and address critical paths of essential supplies associated with maternal health in the Ugandan health system.                                         Methods               We apply system engineering principles and work with community partners in hospitals to develop care process workflow charts (based on essential services) for the lifecycle of maternal health continuum of care. Based on this chart, we develop a cloud-based offline-compatible smart sync platform named ``E+TRA Health'' to triangulate (1) patient admission, diagnoses, delivery information, testing reports from laboratories, (2) inventory information from main store, stores in MCH unit, and (3) lab, to identify the critical list of medical and laboratory supplies, their lead times for procurement and then generate reports and suggested procurement plans for real time decision-making.                                         Results               The E+TRA Health platform was piloted in two Healthcare Center IV facilities in Uganda over a period of 6~months. The system collected more than 5000 patient records and managed more than 500 types of medicines. The pilot study demonstrated the functionalities of E+TRA Health and its feasibility to sense demand from point of care.                                         Conclusion               E+TRA Health is the first to triangulate supply and demand data from three different departments (main store, lab, and MCH) to forecast and generate orders automatically to meet patient demands. It is capable of generating reports required by Ministry of Health in real time compared to one-week lead-time using paper-based systems. This prompts frontline stakeholders to generate efficient, reliable and sustainable strategic healthcare plans with real time data. This system improves patient outcomes through better commodity availability by sensing true patient demands.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.},

Together we illustrate and map the journey of developing the pathways to wellbeing software into story pathways to support a green circular economy. The metalogue enables weaving together the experiences and diverse ways of knowing whilst we explore the environment of a problem together we builds on the work of Gregory Bateson and his daughter Nora Bateson as well as the wisdom of Indigenous sages and scholars who emphasise the importance of strengthening relationships (in our fields of influence) as the route to human and more than human wellbeing. The research paper is one of several papers which will explore ways to enable participatory design and decision making through an online community of practice. Our ``boundary'' that we are setting in the paper focused around the building of relationships in which we are involved and which we are expanding (through a myriad of connections and networks) to build circular economic practices in Venda, specifically in relation to protecting sacred sites and being responsive to Mupo. The first author has a website               https://www.wirasoftfoundtion.org/en\_GB/web/biac-sig/home               on which some ideas on circular economies are expressed. Our hope is that the small pilot can be used to demonstrate a way in which community education can be linked with social enterprises that support earning and learning together in ways that foster social and environmental justice.},

Therefore, six case studies building on qualitative empirical research are analyzed that either focus on Internet of Things (IoT)-driven platform BMI or software as a~service (SaaS) BMI. The results offer a~variety of insights regarding challenges and respective responses. These findings are attributed to DCs and its subdimensions of sensing, seizing and transforming, further revealing the interplay of various factors for specific contexts. Additionally, the study reveals that many challenges and thus required responses are the result of individuals, processes, and structures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Transformative urban development is urgent to achieve future sustainable development and wellbeing. Transformation can benefit from shared and cumulative learning on strategies to guide urban development across local to national scales, while also reflecting the complex emergent nature of urban systems, and the need for context-specific and place-based solutions. The article addresses this challenge, drawing on extensive transdisciplinary engagement and National Strategy co-development processes for Australia. This includes generation of two frameworks as boundary objects to assist such transdisciplinary strategy development. An `enabling urban systems transformation' framework comprises four generic overarching transformation enablers and a set of necessary underpinning urban capacities. This also built cumulatively on other sustainability and urban transformation studies. A complementary `knowledge for urban systems transformation' framework comprises key knowledge themes that can support an integrated systems approach to mission-focused urban transformations, such as decarbonising cities. The article provides insights on the transdisciplinary processes, urban systems frameworks, and scoping of key strategies that may help those developing transformation strategies from local to national scales.                            Science highlights                          \textbullet{} Transdisciplinary national urban strategy development is used to distil generic frameworks and strategy scopes with potential international application.             \textbullet{} The frameworks also build on other published framings to support convergent, cumulative and transdisciplinary urban science.             \textbullet{} The `enabling transformations' and `urban knowledge' frameworks include the perspective of those developing sustainable urban systems strategies.             \textbullet{} The enabling framework also informs `National Urban Policy' and `Knowledge and Innovation Hub' strategies, and prevailing power imbalances.             \textbullet{} The knowledge framework can help frame urban challenges, missions and knowledge programs.                            Policy and practice recommendations                          \textbullet{} An urban `transformation imperative' and `strategic response' can be co-developed from local to national scales.             \textbullet{} Local initiative is crucial to drive urban strategies, but sustained national leadership with coherent policy across sectors and scales is also key.             \textbullet{} Diversity in engagement participation and processes generates whole-of-urban-systems and local-to-national perspectives.             \textbullet{} Urban solutions are context-specific but generic frameworks can help collaborative issue framing and responses.             \textbullet{} Collaborative issue framing informed by generic frameworks can bring broader perspectives to context-specific and contested policy and practice issues.},

Currently, though, HRI is caught in a dilemma of how to create meaningful service robots for human social environments, combining expectations shaped by popular media with technology readiness. We recapitulate traditional stakeholder involvement, including two cases in which new intelligent robots were conceptualized and realized for close interaction with humans. Thereby, we show how the               robot narrative               (impacted by science fiction, the term robot itself, and assumptions on human-like intelligence) together with aspects of               power balancing stakeholders               , such as hardware constraints and missing perspectives beyond primary users, and the               adaptivity of robots               through machine learning that creates unpredictability, pose specific challenges for participatory design processes in HRI. We conclude with thoughts on a way forward for the HRI community in developing a culture of participation that considers humans when conceptualizing, building, and using robots.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper put forward a new interactive design approach for customized garments towards sustainable fashion using machine learning techniques, including radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector regression (SVR). First, RBF ANNs were employed to estimate the detailed human body dimensions to fulfill consumers' ergonomics requirements. Next, the GA-based models were developed to generate the formalized design solutions following the consumer profiles (demands). Afterwards, the evaluation model was established to quantitatively characterize the relations between consumer profiles and garment profiles from the generated design solutions. The design solutions would be digitally demonstrated and recommended to the consumer following the evaluation results in descending order. Meanwhile, the PNN-based models were created to predict garment fitness based on virtual try-on. Moreover, the SVR-based self-adjustment mechanism was built to estimate and control garment design parameters according to the consumer's feedback. Based on these mathematical models, the approach enhances the interactions among digital garment demonstration, the designer's professional knowledge and the user's perception to find out the most relevant design solution. The effectiveness of the new approach was verified by a real application case of leisure pants customization. The results show that the proposed method can powerfully support the designers' quality personalized design solutions for consumers more accurately, fast, intelligently, and sustainably, compared with the existing approaches. More importantly, it also establishes an effective and reliable communication channel and mechanism among consumers, fashion designers, pattern designer, and garment producer.},

Such advances have greatly contributed to a higher level of automation in the lifecycle management of civil assets within a digitalised environment. To integrate all the achievements delivered so far and further step up their progress, this study proposes a novel theory, Engineering Brain, by effectively adopting the Metaverse concept in the field of civil engineering. Specifically, the evolution of the Metaverse and its key supporting technologies are first reviewed; then, the Engineering Brain theory is presented, including its theoretical background, key components and their inter-connections. Outlooks of this theory's implementation within the AEC sector are offered, as a description of the Metaverse of future engineering. Through a comparison between the proposed Engineering Brain theory and the Metaverse, their relationships are illustrated; and how Engineering Brain may function as the Metaverse for future engineering is further explored. Providing an innovative insight into the future engineering sector, this study can potentially guide the entire industry towards its new era based on the Metaverse environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Context               The karst region of southwestern China, one of the largest continuous karsts in the world, is known for its unique landscapes and rich biodiversity. This region has suffered severe environmental degradation (e.g., vegetation cover loss, soil erosion and biodiversity loss). In recent decades, Chinese governments at different levels have initiated several ecological programs (e.g., Green for Grain, Mountain Closure) to restore the degraded environment and to alleviate poverty.                                         Objectives               This study summarizes landscape studies of karst landscapes patterns, their dynamics and interactions among landscape pattern, hydrological processes and ecosystem services (ES).                                         Methods               We conducted a systematic literature review of science and land use policy to identify knowledge gaps and recommend future research and policy directions.                                         Results               Karst landscapes have experienced rapid turnover in recent decades due largely to the overlap of intense human activity on the fragile karst ecosystems. Many studies have comprehensively examined hydrology, soil processes and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships with landscape pattern. Most of these studies have found that karst ecosystems recover with improved ES. However, the importance of epikarst in hydrological and soil processes, intense anthropogenic disturbance and landscape heterogeneity in landscape models remains elusive.                                         Conclusions               Future research should focus on in-depth examination and modelling of karst specific hydrological and soil processes, investigating relationships between climatic change, landscape change, ecological processes, and region-specific ES assessments. Results from such research should provide the necessary scientific support for a comprehensive, national karst rocky desertification treatment project (Stage II) and poverty alleviation initiatives.},

However, the big data and complex models greatly increase the training overhead of DNN, so accelerating their training process becomes a key task. The Tianhe-3 peak speed is designed to target E-class, and the huge computing power provides a potential opportunity for DNN training. We implement and extend LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet model training for a single MT-2000+ and FT-2000+ compute nodes, as well as extended multi-node clusters, and propose an improved gradient synchronization process for Dynamic Allreduce communication optimization strategy for the gradient synchronization process base on the ARM architecture features of the Tianhe-3 prototype, providing experimental data and theoretical basis for further enhancing and improving the performance of the Tianhe-3 prototype in large-scale distributed training of neural networks.},

However, the way in which a specific color influences people's color selection and the role of their eye movements and cultural factors in this process remain unknown. In this study, to delve into this problem, we designed an experiment to determine the influence of specific colors on people's product preferences by using an eye-tracking device, intending to identify the role of their eye movements and cultural factors. Based on the experimental data, a detailed influence path model was built to describe the effect of specific colors on product evaluations by an integrated moderation and mediation analysis. Our findings show that in the influence process, the effects of specific colors on product evaluations are mediated by eye movements. Additionally, cultural factors partly moderate the process as an influencing factor. The research findings from this study have important implications for user-centered product design and visual marketing management.},

Technological advances in machine intelligence have enabled a growing number of applications in human\textemdash machine collaborative decision-making. Therefore, it is desirable to achieve superior performance by fully leveraging human and machine capabilities. In risky decision-making, a human decision-maker is vulnerable to cognitive biases when judging the possible outcomes of a risky event, whereas a machine decision-maker cannot handle new and dynamic contexts with incomplete information well. We first summarize features of risky decision-making and possible biases of human decision-makers therein. Then, we argue the necessity and urgency of advancing human\textemdash machine collaboration in risky decision-making. Afterward, we review the literature on human\textemdash machine collaboration in a general decision context, from the perspectives of human\textemdash machine organization, relationship, and collaboration. Lastly, we propose challenges of enhancing human\textemdash machine communication and teamwork in risky decision-making, followed by future research avenues.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Highly sophisticated capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) have skyrocketed its popularity across many industry sectors globally. The public sector is one of these. Many cities around the world are trying to position themselves as leaders of urban innovation through the development and deployment of AI systems. Likewise, increasing numbers of local government agencies are attempting to utilise AI technologies in their operations to deliver policy and generate efficiencies in highly uncertain and complex urban environments. While the popularity of AI is on the rise in urban policy circles, there is limited understanding and lack of empirical studies on the city manager perceptions concerning urban AI systems. Bridging this gap is the rationale of this study. The methodological approach adopted in this study is twofold. First, the study collects data through semi-structured interviews with city managers from Australia and the US. Then, the study analyses the data using the summative content analysis technique with two data analysis software. The analysis identifies the following themes and generates insights into local government services: AI adoption areas, cautionary areas, challenges, effects, impacts, knowledge basis, plans, preparedness, roadblocks, technologies, deployment timeframes, and usefulness. The study findings inform city managers in their efforts to deploy AI in their local government operations, and offer directions for prospective research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The rapid evolution of Internet~of~Things (IoT) technologies, with ever more profound implications for humans and societies, has triggered visions and initiatives to re-align the Next-Generation IoT with what works for humans and humanity first. However, despite the increased push towards ``human-centric'' IoT, it is still poorly understood what ``human-centric'' actually means in this context, how it is interpreted and embedded into the design, by whom, and for which purposes. To address these questions, we conducted a systematic literature review (N = 84) on the theory, principles, and design requirements of human-centric IoT. A key observation is that, despite the recent increase in research on humane perspectives for IoT,~``human-centredness'' often still seems to be used primarily as a label and overarching paradigm, not leading to a profound change in the underlying practices. We found no shared understanding of what ``human-centric'' implies in this context or common agreement on which principles human-centric IoT should be built upon. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed the predominance of technology-oriented fields, with a traditional approach towards user involvement and limited involvement of other disciplines. Overall, our findings point towards an apparent discrepancy between how contributions are positioned and framed (``human-centric''), the practices and assumptions they are based on, and their actual impact and ability to orient existing efforts towards genuine human-centric outcomes and key values. Based on the results, we formulate directions for future research aimed at building a more human-centric and empowering IoT.},

However, designing for a genuinely humanity-centric vision poses potential barriers related to the technical frameworks and methods of IEs. This paper introduces a multi-disciplinary innovation research approach grounded in a participatory ForSTI (i.e., Foresight in Science, Technology, and Innovation) methodology. We apply a Horizon scanning exercise in combination with expert interviews and a lead user workshop to develop a future humanity-centric roadmap for IEs that aligns with a coherent understanding of human and societal needs. Multiple technical visions are explored to foresee how ethics, human control, and agency can be preserved in developing future human-centric IEs. Our findings indicate that the ``feasible'' future vision is propelled forward by               technical enchanted determinism               , with weak resistance from the public, citizens, and society. The ``possible'' vision augments humans and the environment through technical advancement. In contrast, the most ``desirable'' vision is inclusive of all humanity, also the most vulnerable, and can bring forth meaningful human involvement and influence in the technical configurations of IEs. By carefully considering the potential drivers and barriers ahead, we can re-think how to design for the most desirable future vision in developing IEs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modeling is a key activity in conceptual design and system design. Through collaborative modeling, end-users, stakeholders, experts, and entrepreneurs are able to create a shared understanding of a system representation. While the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the major conceptual modeling languages in object-oriented software engineering, more and more concerns arise from the modeling quality of UML and its tool-support. Among them, the limitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of natural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this paper, we explore the potential of using virtual reality (VR) technology for collaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative software design using conventional devices (desktop PC/laptop). For this purpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural collaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study with 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with conventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, but the user's fun, the feeling of being in the same room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were increased.},

Despite the significant progress we have made in understanding how city networks are connected and spread out, we still have a lot to learn about the meaning and context of these networks. The increasing availability of open data offers opportunities to supplement urban networks with specific location information and create more expressive urban machine-learning models. In this work, we introduce Urbanity, a network-based Python package to automate the construction of feature-rich urban networks anywhere and at any geographical scale. We discuss data sources, the features of our software, and a set of data representing the networks of five major cities around the world. We also test the usefulness of added context in our networks by classifying different types of connections within a single network. Our findings extend accumulated knowledge about how spaces and flows within city networks work, and affirm the importance of contextual features for analyzing city networks.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            As robots increasingly become part of our everyday lives, questions arise with regards to how to approach them and how to understand them in social contexts. The Western history of human\textendash robot relations revolves around competition and control, which restricts our ability to relate to machines in other ways. In this study, we take a relational approach to explore different manners of socializing with robots, especially those that exceed an instrumental approach. The nonhuman subjects of this study are built to explore non-purposeful behavior, in an attempt to break away from the assumptions of utility that underlie the hegemonic human\textendash machine interactions. This breakaway is accompanied by `learning to be attuned' on the side of the human subjects, which is facilitated by continuous relations at the level of everyday life. Our paper highlights this ground for the emergence of meanings and questions that could not be subsumed by frameworks of control and domination. The research-creation project               Machine M\'enagerie               serves as a case study for these ideas, demonstrating a relational approach in which the designer and the machines co-constitute each other through sustained interactions, becoming attuned to one another through the performance of research.               Machine M\'enagerie               attempts to produce affective and playful\textemdash if not unruly\textemdash nonhuman entities that invite interaction yet have no intention of serving human social or physical needs. We diverge from other social robotics research by creating machines that do not attempt to mimic human social behaviours.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Climate vulnerability is higher in coastal regions. Communities can largely reduce their hazard vulnerabilities and increase their social resilience through design and planning, which could put cities on a trajectory for long-term stability. However, the silos within the design and planning communities and the gap between research and practice have made it difficult to achieve the goal for a flood resilient environment. Therefore, this paper suggests an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven platform to facilitate the flood resilience design and planning. This platform, with the active engagement of local residents, experts, policy makers, and practitioners, will break the aforementioned silos and close the knowledge gaps, which ultimately increases public awareness, improves collaboration effectiveness, and achieves the best design and planning outcomes. We suggest a holistic and integrated approach, bringing multiple disciplines (architectural design, landscape architecture, urban planning, geography, and computer science), and examining the pressing resilient issues at the macro, meso, and micro scales.},

As programmable applications to automatically write, verify, and enforce transaction conditions, smart contracts can be used in different areas mainly to improve automation level, information security, and built digital environment enhancement. However, the smart contract is commonly mentioned as a blockchain appendage, while its unique connotation and value in the construction industry have not been recognized. Therefore, this study carries out a systematic review based on 81 research articles published from 2014 to 2021 on smart contract applications in construction to explore and highlight their potentials under domain-specific requirements. Results are analyzed according to research type categorization and domain codification. Eight research domains are identified, where the three most highly explored domains are contract and payment, supply chain and logistics, and information management. The integration of smart contracts with other innovative concepts and advanced technologies is analyzed. The applicability, benefits, and challenges of smart contract applications regarding different research domains are discussed.},

Building a lunar base presents numerous obstacles and requires environmental perception, feedback design, and construction methods. An integrated fabrication process that incorporates design, 3D printing workflow, and construction details to build a bionic, reconfigurable and high-performance lunar base prototype is presented in this paper. The research comprises the study of the lunar regolith 3D printing mechanism, the real-time control of powder laying and compaction procedure, and the development of a 3D printing tool end system. In this paper, many scientific questions regarding in situ fabrication on the lunar surface are raised and addressed with the proposal of a progressive optimization design method, the molding principle, and gradation strategy of lunar soil-polyaryletherketone (PAEK) hybrid powder, and the principle of dual-light field 3D laser printing. The feasibility of the technical strategy proposed in this paper is verified by the presented empirical samples.},

This article investigates the requirements necessary in order for AI to actually serve a public interest, and hence be socially good. The authors propose shifting the focus of the discourse towards democratic governance processes when developing and deploying AI systems. The article draws from the rich history of public interest theory in political philosophy and law, and develops a framework for `public interest AI'. The framework consists of (1) public justification for the AI system, (2) an emphasis on equality, (3) deliberation/ co-design process, (4) technical safeguards, and (5) openness to validation. This framework is then applied to two case studies, namely SyRI, the Dutch welfare fraud detection project, and UNICEF's Project Connect, that maps schools worldwide. Through the analysis of these cases, the authors conclude that public interest is a helpful and practical guide for the development and governance of AI for the people.},

We conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature to test the reliability and validity of the scale. The scale demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity based on a randomized sample of 211 studies extracted from the output of the systematic review. The scale can help provide a more complete assessment of the quality of the design process of technology-based supports for autism and be beneficial to autistic people, their families, and related professionals in making informed decisions regarding such supports.},

  abstract = {Abstract             When addressing corporate sustainability challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) is a double-edged sword. AI can make significant progress on the most complicated environmental and social problems faced by humans. On the other hand, the efficiencies and innovations generated by AI may also bring new risks, such as automated bias and conflicts with human ethics. We argue that companies and governments should make collective efforts to address sustainability challenges and risks brought by AI. Accountable and sustainable AI can be achieved through a proactive regulatory framework supported by rigorous corporate policies and reports. Given the rapidly evolving nature of this technology, we propose a harmonised and risk-based regulatory approach that accommodates diverse AI solutions to achieve the common good. Ensuring an adequate level of technological neutrality and proportionality of the regulation is the key to mitigating the wide range of potential risks inherent to the use of AI. Instead of promoting sustainability, unregulated AI would be a threat since it would not be possible to effectively monitor its effects on the economy, society and environment. Such a suitable regulatory framework would not only create a consensus concerning the risks to avoid and how to do so but also include enforcement mechanisms to ensure a trustworthy and ethical use of AI in the boardroom. Once this objective is achieved, it will be possible to refer to this technological development as a common good in itself that constitutes an essential asset to human development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Product customization is a means that effectively caters to personal needs, and as such, has increasingly caught the attention of both consumers and manufacturers. With technological advancements, the customization of products is now being made available through mobile applications. However, mobile apps need to be easy to use and operate, which presents some challenges for mobile app designers. In response, this study proposes an interactive evolutionary design method for mobile apps, based on an interactive genetic algorithm, to help consumers generate high-quality designs and enhance their retail experience by optimizing synthetic fitness and reducing the user's fatigue from evaluation. Firstly, a human\textendash computer interaction model for mobile interactive evolutionary design was launched to solve the screen space problem and simplify the evaluation process. Secondly, to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, this paper combines hesitation patterns to obtain accurate individual fitness. Thirdly, an ongoing prediction and replacement mechanism were presented to improve user experience. After addressing these items, the proposed method is applied to a customization system that involves traditional brocade patterns of the Zhuang ethnic group in southwestern China and validated using a conventional interactive evolutionary design system with an interactive genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases the designs' efficiency, and can help consumers effectively customize their product purchases on mobile devices.},

In terms of large-scale and high-speed ships, water-lubricated bearings with high performance are more strictly required. However, due to the lubricating medium, water-lubricated bearings have many problems such as friction, wear, vibration, noise, etc. This review focuses on the performance of marine water-lubricated bearings and their failure prevention mechanism. Furthermore, the research of marine water-lubricated bearings is reviewed by discussing its lubrication principle, test technology, friction and wear mechanism, and friction noise generation mechanism. The performance enhancement methods have been overviewed from structure optimization and material modification. Finally, the potential problems and the perspective of water-lubricated bearings are given in detail.},

  abstract = {Abstract               There was a problem of great distraction in traditional touch interactive operation of in-vehicle information interface, but the application of gesture recognition technology on in-vehicle system improved this problem. However, users had less experience in this new interactive mode, and the cognitive deviation of the agreement between gestures and commands could directly affect the safety of drivers. The main purpose of this paper was to obtain the user's preference mid-air gestures for the in-vehicle information interface by using the user-elicitation method. In addition, the optimized gesture recognition network structure was applied to the prototype system of in-vehicle information interaction with user-defined mid-air gestures developed by us, and the effectiveness of the system was evaluated by collecting eye movement indicators of users through the simulation of driving eye movement experiments. In the process of user elicitation, the principle of command prompt and agreement rate was introduced. According to the agreement rate elicited by users (AR\,=\,.397), we got the gesture consensus set design direction of in-vehicle information control. The experimental results of the eye movement index showed that the method of user-defined mid-air gestures can effectively improve driving safety on in-vehicle media control, and reduced the distraction of users when driving compared with the traditional touch-based method.

Constructed an in-vehicle secondary task control prototype system based on gesture recognition.                                                           The eye movement experiment proved that the prototype system can reduce the user's distraction when operating the in-vehicle's secondary tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Bridge health monitoring (BHM) technology has been widely accepted as a powerful tool to assess structural performance and has moved from research to practice. Driven by the enormous demand of ensuring bridge safety, the application of BHM technology is particularly active in China and has become an emerging industry in the civil engineering community. It is a common belief among civil engineers that the development and implementation of industry standards will be of paramount importance in guiding the healthy development of BHM and increasing the transfer of professional knowledge and techniques to practical applications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the standardization construction and development trend for BHM in China. The achievements, characteristics, and challenges of China's bridge construction are first introduced. Then, the existing problems of BHM and the necessity of constructing the standardization system for the BHM industry are discussed. Following that, these standards published for guiding BHM system design, construction, management, and maintenance, especially sensor selection, sensor placement, sensor installation, data transmission, data storage, data processing, and early warning, are outlined. Finally, work requiring further efforts in the near future is drawn.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The space layout of a reasonable modular building prototype is a time consuming and complex process. Many studies have optimised automatic spatial layouts based on spatial adjacency simulation. Although machine-produced plans satisfy the adjacency and area constraints, people still need further manual modifications to meet other spatially complex design requirements. Motivated by this, we provide a human\textendash machine collaborative design workflow that simulates the spatial adjacency relationship based on physical models. Compared with previous works, our workflow enhances the automated space layout process by allowing designers to use environment anchors to make decisions in automatic layout iterations. A case study is proposed to demonstrate that the solution generated by our workflow can initially complete different customised design tasks. The workflow combines the advantages of the designer's decision-making experience in manual modelling with the machine's ability in rapid automated layout. In the future, it has the potential to be developed into a designer-machine collaboration tool for completing complex building design tasks.},
