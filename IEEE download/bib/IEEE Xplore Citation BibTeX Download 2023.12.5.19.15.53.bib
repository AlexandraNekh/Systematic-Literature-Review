  abstract={This position paper reconsiders the “social” aspect of XR systems for healthcare, often developed following a “problem-solution” approach that neglects sociocultural factors affecting their codesign and successful adoption. Focusing on coastal and rural communities, we review and present key principles to consider when codesigning XR systems with marginalised groups. Our work stems from two projects funded by UK Research & Innovation that aim to promote healthy ageing in coastal communities.},

  abstract={Participatory design is a popular design technique that involves the end-users in the early stages of the design process to obtain user-friendly gestural interfaces. Guessability studies followed by agreement analyses are often used to elicit and comprehend the preferences (gestures/proposals) of the participants. Previous approaches to assess agreement, grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this work, we represent the gestures using binary description vectors to allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as a soft agreement rate (SAR) to quantify the level of consensus between the participants. In addition, we performed computational experiments to study the behavior of our partial agreement formula and mathematically show that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our methodology was evaluated through a gesture elicitation study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR metric is 2.64 times higher than the existing metrics. In addition to the most agreed gesture, SAR formulation also provides the mostly agreed descriptors which can potentially help the designers to come up with a final gesture set.},

  abstract={The lessons learned from a grass roots effort involving information systems developers and engineers in the design and development of a customized work process support system, named Fredrik, are discussed. The information system developed is a dynamic, Web-based work process system to support the end-to-end scheduling, planning, design and documentation activities of an "extreme collaboration" design team. The system is used to help schedule and manage multiple pre-design session meetings, to track and store information gathered and generated before, during and after a real time design session, and to facilitate document and design information retrieval for later re-use. While the close partnering between the users and developers solved some long standing trust issues, and resulted in a system more optimized to the engineering team's needs, the participatory design process inadvertently produced a less stable and sexy system potentially affecting future sources of funding for upgrading the system.},

  abstract={The management of coupled human-natural (CHN) systems, including natural resource and environmental systems, would benefit from recognition of the need to integrate, and bring critical thinking, transparency, and accountability to science and policy development. It would benefit also from: (1) stakeholder engagement and participatory processes, (2) societal and institutional continuity in science and decisions evaluation and follow-through, and (3) recognition and understanding of the role of biases, beliefs, heuristics, and values (BBHV) in decision-making.We suggest that creating multi-media, efficiently accessible, "Records of Engagement" (RoE) could support meeting the above needs. RoE would offer: (1) a reward system to support and foster stakeholder engagement; (2) a record structure for evaluating processes and outcomes and for learning and knowledge transfer, and (3) an opportunity to systematize, facilitate, create efficiencies, and improve the engagement of experts and stakeholders in participatory modeling, planning and policy development. RoE, in our view, should also not only describe scientific evidence and lines of argumentation but also BBHV and emotions expressed, a first step in understanding their impacts on decision making and management of CHN systems.We seek to engage readers to help us determine how to create RoE, including what they might contain to be most useful. Preliminary thoughts are offered on RoE framework design and content, and on a Decision Tracking System and methodologies that could be used to support creation and use of RoE. Some existing stakeholder engagement records are discussed in reference to the ideal RoE that we envision.},

  abstract={Extended Reality (XR) is actively bringing innovative opportunities to business, from Virtual Reality (VR) assistants to Augmented Reality (AR) sales advertisements. However, there is currently a lack of adaptive profiling in training simulators, limiting their potential, effectiveness, dynamicity, and customization. This paper proposes the use of a Content-Based Recommender System integrated into an XR simulator to predict training scenarios for the user. Although customization can be achieved in many ways, this project focuses on in-game input data: user interaction with virtual objects, decisions made by the user, and metadata associated with the training scenario (plot keywords, characters involved in the scenarios, objects metadata, scenario category and room in which the scenario takes place). The results of the user study show that the participants enjoyed the simulation and preferred a dynamic and customized training narrative compared to a standard linear one. This innovative approach will enable in the future the automation of personalized training simulations, creating targeted and individual XR experiences for each user.},

  abstract={Low-cost virtual-reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) with the integration of smartphones have brought the immersive VR to the masses, and increased the ubiquity of VR. However, these systems are often limited by their poor interactivity. In this paper, we present GestOnHMD, a gesture-based interaction technique and a gesture-classification pipeline that leverages the stereo microphones in a commodity smartphone to detect the tapping and the scratching gestures on the front, the left, and the right surfaces on a mobile VR headset. Taking the Google Cardboard as our focused headset, we first conducted a gesture-elicitation study to generate 150 user-defined gestures with 50 on each surface. We then selected 15, 9, and 9 gestures for the front, the left, and the right surfaces respectively based on user preferences and signal detectability. We constructed a data set containing the acoustic signals of 18 users performing these on-surface gestures, and trained the deep-learning classification pipeline for gesture detection and recognition. Lastly, with the real-time demonstration of GestOnHMD, we conducted a series of online participatory-design sessions to collect a set of user-defined gesture-referent mappings that could potentially benefit from GestOnHMD.},

  abstract={Curriculum size constantly challenges healthcare education and training. Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset. An example such term is described and presented as proof of application. The semantic modelling implemented in this work is directly applicable to a previously proposed visual data structure and subsequent authoring environment that could facilitate XR resource design and authoring from non-technical experts.},

  abstract={Complex product development framework and methodology is evolving with the development of industrial technology, information technology and management technology. The traditional product development framework and methodology is a waterfall style, which is usually described as the V model. In the V model, the design result of the earliest stage will be validated, verified and accredited at the last stage. In order to reduce the cycle of verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) and increase the probability of successful design within fewest iterations, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) proposes a design information transferring methodology based on digital models, which extends the V model to double Vs model. The development of big data technology and data-driven machine learning provides an opportunity to converge data lifecycle, model lifecycle and product development lifecycle together. The paper reviews product development models from V to double Vs, and presents a model and data driven triple Vs model for product development in the big data era.},

And then the architecture of a multi-agent based collaborative design system is introduced, with defining all the agents of the architecture in detail. Agents communicate with each other using XML technology. Based on it, a prototype system using JavaEE environment is developed. Customers and designers can access the system by internet, customers input product parameters, designers design the roll, and simulation program simulate the design parameters to decide whether the parameters is reasonable and send feedback message to designers. All data are stored in database to carry out data mining and to provide intelligent support. A case study is given at the end of this paper to validate the course of using this multi-agent system.},

  pages={137613-137634},
  abstract={Validation of software requirements is a primary phase in requirements engineering that ensures requirements match the target system with the intended needs of the acquirer. It aims to detect and correct errors that prevail in the specified requirements. Although there are tremendous requirements validation approaches, some software may fail because of limited or ineffective requirements validation techniques and unreliable requirements’ quality characteristics. In this study, a systematic literature review of requirements validation is performed. The study analyzes the most adopted validation techniques, reports requirements quality characteristics, and discovers significant challenges of validation techniques. The review identified 66 relevant primary studies analyzed to derive deep insights into the following aspects of requirements validation: trends of requirements validation methods, including their subtechnique strengths and weaknesses, requirements quality characteristics categories, and adopted tools and datasets in these techniques. We grouped validation techniques into categories: prototyping, inspection, knowledge-oriented, test-oriented, modeling and assessment, and formal models. The analysis reported 19 validation techniques, 27 tools, new requirements validation characteristics, and several challenges that prevailed through validation techniques. The trend of validation techniques is to those methods that apply machine learning techniques with knowledge from dictionaries and ontologies. Most challenges are about how to express the requirements and how to revert clients’ feedback. There is a strong relationship between validation techniques, software application domain, and requirements validation quality attributes. Thus, there is an immense need to unify the quality characteristics and domain-specific validation methods.},

  abstract={Virtual reality is a technology, which is often regarded as a natural extension to 3D computer graphics with advanced input and output devices. It can help manufacturing enterprises attain their common goal for lowering the total manufacturing costs, producing products in shorter times and with higher quality, and deliver products on time. This paper explored the application of several advance technologies such as VRML, multi-agent and Petri-net in virtual intelligent assembly system. A proof-of-concept desktop system, namely, virtual intelligent assembly system for machine tools (VIASMT) based on multi-agent and Petri-net has been proposed and developed to display assembly process and demonstrate correlative functions of virtual machine tool. The common feature of traditional methods is that establishing a precise state equation to simulate the dynamic process of system. But, VIASMT can't be described by accurate mathematical method in fact. Relatively speaking, Petri net has stronger ability to describe the dynamic property of system perfectly, and its graphic means is more easily to be understood and accepted. Some software development kits such as visual C++ and Open Inventor are used to implement the VIASMT with the help of multi-agent and Petri-net technologies. The work flowchart is given. In this virtual intelligent assembly system, a new machine tool can be assembled easily and rapidly. In this paper, several application instances are provided},

Intellectual property is the core resource in the crowdsourcing design service model, which is faced with various risks due to the lack of effective control. In this context, this paper proposes an intellectual property risk assessment method based on an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in crowdsourcing design. First of all, the influencing factors of intellectual property risk in crowdsourcing design are analyzed, and a set of intellectual property risk assessment index system is constructed. Secondly, a risk assessment model based on ANFIS is established to quantitatively assess intellectual property risks in crowdsourcing design. Finally, the proposed ANFIS model has been trained and evaluated, and the experimental results show that the method can achieve accurate evaluation of intellectual property risks.},

  abstract={The evolution of the economic environment towards services orientation has introduced new challenges for companies. They attempt to design innovative services to support the value creation of their customer's business. In this context the knowledge is becoming a key matter for strategy and innovation. Many scholars have stressed the knowledge management approaches for the design of products. However services provide new issues which are linked to their own characteristics (e.g. intangibility, heterogeneity, coproduction). The methods and tools of knowledge management have to be adapted to the field of services design. Indeed it is important to acquire, represent and reuse the service-related knowledge which is tacit and co-created by providers, customers and others partners working together. Our work pursues the ongoing discussion of SSME (services science, management and engineering), an emergent discipline gathering the synergies around services science. It is also based on the example of a telecommunication operator which is trying to improve its methods to design services. Our approach is supported by a framework which describes services as services systems and a Web-based studio called SBCD (services browser for collaborative design). This paper gives an overview of this framework's main features (change of state, co-construction, business processes, services medium and access). Then it focuses on the role of knowledge in this context and proposes a knowledge acquisition method for the construction of an ontology to describe services systems.},

Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots. We see the potential of this approach to move the development closer to the actual learner.},

  abstract={The aim of this work is to propose a methodology of sizing in a frame of the conception of mechatronic systems in particular and active dynamic ones, in general. This methodology will support conceptual design step. We propose a collaborative design approach based on Bond Graph tool and Genetic algorithms. Mechatronic systems have a passive part and active part. In our approach we establish a hard interaction between passive and active parts. This interaction will be materialized in taking into account of control criteria in the evolution (synthesis) phase of passive part. This initiative treats functional aspects, both structural and behavioral; while respecting interactions between passive and active parts. In our approach we treat functional, structural and behavioral aspects in order to validate a post-project solution. Optimization needs Behavioral models which are systematically deducted from bond-graph structural models. Thus, retained bond graph elements which constitute passive part will be obtained, done by optimization Genetic Algorithms procedure. In this procedure Gramians of controllability and of observability represent the fitness function. The proposed method will be applied to an automatic transmission of a scooter and validated by a dynamic simulation.},

The aim of VMDP is to excavate human being’s design wisdom and creative ability of manufacture and design maximally, to excavate the material’s properties and potential abilities maximally. The essence of VMDP is to realize that the product’s units and subunits occupy the minimal volume while their functions and capacities are maximum in unit volume, the products will be manufactured with the least material resources while they have the benefits of green design and manufacture. According to binary inference feedback algorithm, the optimization theory and mathematical model of the volume minimizing design principle in guiding the design process are developed.},

  abstract={In this paper, we examine the challenges of developing international standards for Trustworthy AI that aim both to be global applicable and to address the ethical questions key to building trust at a commercial and societal level. We begin by examining the validity of grounding standards that aim for international reach on human right agreements, and the need to accommodate variations in prioritization and tradeoffs in implementing rights in different societal and cultural settings. We then examine the major recent proposals from the OECD, the EU and the IEEE on ethical governance of Trustworthy AI systems in terms of their scope and use of normative language. From this analysis, we propose a preliminary minimal model for the functional roles relevant to Trustworthy AI as a framing for further standards development in this area. We also identify the different types of interoperability reference points that may exist between these functional roles and remark on the potential role they could play in future standardization. Finally we examine a current AI standardization effort under ISO/IEC JTC1 to consider how future Trustworthy AI standards may be able to build on existing standards in developing ethical guidelines and in particular on the ISO standard on Social Responsibility. We conclude by proposing some future directions for research and development of Trustworthy AI standards.},

  abstract={In general a design process is complex and requires the collaboration of several designers on the same product to improve its reliability, performance and efficiency. Though the increase of the Internet as a communication means that supports the sharing and transferring of knowledge, the collaborative declarative design phase lacks for a) imprecision in declaring the statements (ambiguity) and b) subjective interpretation of a scene with respect to the current designer's profile. For this reason, on-line learning strategies should be applied, which models the actual user's preferences. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptable learning strategy for dynamic modeling of a designer profile based an adaptable neural network architecture. The scheme optimally updates the network weights in a way that the current designers' preferences are trusted as much as possible, while simultaneously a minimal degradation of the already obtained network knowledge is minimized. The algorithm requires low computational complexity and guarantees stable performance instead of conventional neural network training schemes, whose the solution is often trapped to local minima.},

In this paper, an optimized 2×2 CNN accelerator chiplet framework with a SerDes link model is presented, which addresses the above challenges. A methodology for designing a 2×2 CNN accelerator chiplet framework is also proposed, and several experiments are conducted. The system performances of different designs are compared and analyzed with different design parameters of computation hardware, SerDes links, and improved scheduling algorithms. The results show that with the same interconnection structure and bandwidth, every 1TFLOPS increase in one chiplet’s computing power can bring an average 3.7% execution time reduction.},

In order to support product design, this paper studies the modeling framework of digital twins first, and proposes a product design modeling framework including physical layer, model layer, information layer and application layer. Then, based on the meta-modeling method, the digital twin design meta-model is defined, which includes business metadata, data model and associated metamodel. Meanwhile, a unified description model for the whole life cycle of digital twins is constructed, which includes the relational sets of metadata models such as process, resources, knowledge and products. The data interaction between physical entities and digital twins is completed, which solves the problems of data interaction between physical domains and information domains, data exchange and information sharing among heterogeneous models, and realizes the association and fusion of multi-dimensional information in the whole life cycle of digital twins.},

  abstract={Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the direct application of information technology in the construction industry. It has many advantages such as shared API data interfaces, high data integration, data consistency, data relevance and construction demonstration functions. It has been widely used and achieved remarkable results. In the 21st century, the development trend of Beijing city is to develop towards the sky and underground. Especially in the past ten years, with the increase of high-rise and super high-rise buildings in Beijing, and the booming development of subway construction. The underground continuous wall is a construction technology with very high use value whether it is used as the main body (or part of the main body) of the underground structure or as a waterproof and soil retaining facility during construction. However, in the Beijing area, the underground diaphragm wall (depth greater than 40 meters, width greater than or equal to 1.2 meters) due to the difficulty of the project, complex technology, and many construction problems, the relevant design and construction experience is less, and the relevant technical talents are scarce. The purpose of this article is to study the application of BIM in underground continuous walls. This article is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 development platform, based on the Visual C# programming language, using the API data interface provided by the Revit 2018 software, based on the built BIM model, for engineering quantity statistics, collision checking, drawing output, collaborative work and construction models. Wait for operations to show the application of BIM technology in the underground continuous wall. Experiments show that the use of the collision detection function of BIM technology can not only reasonably arrange pipelines, but also adjust the positions of brackets, buttresses and other components to facilitate the on-site installation of pipelines. The use of BIM technology can simulate the hoisting of the pipe gallery, find out the collision points in the hoisting process, and improve the hoisting plan.},

According to the characteristics of MMC secondary board card, it was studied on the coupling mechanism between temperature and vibration, and an analysis approach of thermal-structural coupling was proposed. Based on this approach, an analysis application concerned thermal vibration coupling was developed, and a unit control board from MMC power module was adopted in thermal-structural simulation tests. The design defects of secondary board card were discovered, and corresponding suggestions were put forth. All these test results demonstrate that the reliability level of MMC secondary board card can be effectively improved by the proposed method - simulation test of multi-physical field coupling.},

  abstract={This paper presents a participatory design study about how consent to interaction and observation of other users can be supported in social VR. We use emerging VR dating applications, colloquially called the dating metaverse, as context for study of harm-mitigative design structures in social VR given the evidence of harms that occur through dating apps and general social VR applications individually, and the harms that may occur through their convergence. Through design workshops with potential dating metaverse users in the Midwest United States (n=18) we elucidate nonconsensual experiences that should be prevented and participant-created designs for informing and exchanging consent in VR. We position consent as a valuable lens for which to design preventative solutions to harm in social VR by reframing harm as unwanted experiences that happen because of the absence of mechanics to support users in giving and denying agreement to a virtual experience before it occurs.},

  abstract={We present the design process of the robot YOLO aimed at stimulating creativity in children. This robot was developed under a human-centered design approach with participatory design practices during two years and involving 142 children as active contributors at all design stages. The main contribution of this work is the development of methods and tools for child-centered robot design. We adapted existing participatory design practices used with adults to fit children’s development stages. We followed the DoubleDiamond Design Process Model and rested the design process of the robot on the following principles: low floor and wide walls, creativity provocations, open-ended playfulness, and disappointment avoidance through abstraction. The final product is a social robot designed for and with children. Our results show that YOLO increases their creativity during play, demonstrating a successful robot design project. We identified several guidelines that made the design process successful: the use of toys as tools, playgrounds as spaces, the emphasis of playfulness for child expression, and child policies as allies for design studies. The design process described empowers children’s in the design of robots.CCS CONCEPTS• Human-centered computing $\rightarrow$Human computer interaction (HCI).},

  abstract={As the aviation industry is actively working on adopting AI for air traffic, stakeholders agree on the need for a human-centered approach. However, automation design is often driven by user-centered intentions, while the development is actually technology-centered. This can be attributed to a discrepancy between the system designers’ perspective and complexities in real-world use. The same can be currently observed with AI applications where most design efforts focus on the interface between humans and AI, while the overall system design is built on preconceived assumptions. To understand potential usability issues of AI-driven cockpit assistant systems from the users’ perspective, we conducted interviews with four experienced pilots. While our participants did discuss interface issues, they were much more concerned about how autonomous systems could be a burden if the operational complexity exceeds their capabilities. Besides commonly addressed human-AI interface issues, our results thus point to the need for more consideration of operational complexities on a system-design level.},

  abstract={A distributed virtual environment (DVE) consists of multiple network nodes (servers), each of which can host many users that consume CPU resources on that node and communicate with users on other nodes. Users can be dynamically migrated between the nodes, and the ultimate goal for the migration policy is to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. In order to achieve this, the user migration policy should minimize network communication while balancing the load among the nodes so that CPU resources of the individual nodes are not overloaded. This paper considers a multi-player online game as an example of a DVE and presents an adaptive distributed user migration policy, which uses Reinforcement Learning to tune itself so as to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. Performance of the self-tuning policy was compared on a simulator with the standard benchmark non-adaptive migration policy and with the optimal static user allocation policy in a variety of scenarios, and the self-tuning policy was shown to greatly outperform both benchmark policies, with performance difference increasing as the network became more overloaded.},

  abstract={The interaction between technology and healthcare has a long history. However, recent years have witnessed the rapid growth and adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the advent of miniature wearable biosensors, and research advances in big data techniques for effective manipulation of large, multiscale, multimodal, distributed, and heterogeneous data sets. These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs. To enable this transformation, it is necessary for a large number of significant technological advancements in the hardware and software communities to come together. This keynote paper addresses all these important aspects of novel IoT technologies for smart healthcare-wearable sensors, body area sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and big data analytics. It identifies new perspectives and highlights compelling research issues and challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, and security, with various case studies. In addition, with the help of examples, we show how knowledge from CAD areas, such as large scale analysis and optimization techniques can be applied to the important problems of eHealth.},

  abstract={Supply chain networks are typical examples of complex systems. Thereby, making decisions in such systems remains a very hard issue. To assist decision makers in formulating the appropriate strategies, robust tools are needed. Pure optimization models are not appropriate for several reasons. First, an optimization model cannot capture the dynamic behavior of a complex system. Furthermore, most common practical problems are very constrained to be modeled as simple tractable models. To fill in the gap, hybrid optimization/simulation techniques have been applied to improve the decision-making process. In this paper we explore the near-full spectrum of optimization methods and simulation techniques. A review and taxonomy were performed to give an overview of the broad field of optimization/simulation approaches applied to solve supply chain problems. Since the possibilities of coupling them are numerous, we launch a discussion and analysis that aims at determining the appropriate framework for the studied problem depending on its characteristics. Our study may serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners to select the suitable technique to solve a problem and/or to identify the promising issues to be further explored.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper addresses the definition and implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 education. CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.},

  abstract={The global manufacturing industry is entering an era of considerable growth and innovation due to radical developments in advanced technologies. Knowledge remains crucial in improving product design, decision making, productivity, and increasing the speed of innovation. Communication is at the heart of knowledge exchange between stakeholders, especially those with different technical and social backgrounds. However, significant barriers exist when sharing product design knowledge due to the lack of available formalized tools and methods. In this article, to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders during product design, a method to systematically improve the understanding of target objects, including the composition of the object, nature of the object, and tools to support its related communication, is proposed. Further, a knowledge representation framework is described which enables parties to clearly understand the characteristics of the object and greatly improve communication efficiency. A case study is presented to validate how the proposed framework provides valuable insights into the improvement of design communication and contributes to global manufacturing development.},

Using gamification to engage stakeholders is an interesting topic for many organizations, but the lack of a clear procedure for applying these methods has led to not achieving the expected results. In this study, we will introduce a new technique for designing gamification in servicing companies in which customers and employees interact with each other also examine the principles of setting up a game site based on statistical computing and data mining algorithms.},

  abstract={Information and communication technology has been hailed for playing a crucial role in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. That notwithstanding, the realization of this agenda depends on the convergence of sustainable use and deployment of ICT with strong commitment from local and global partnerships and corporations. Thus, to achieve the 17 UN SDGs, local efforts and realities must be incorporated. Like many other countries, the Finnish government has set an ambitious goal to be a carbon-neutral nation by 2035. However, research on how such an ambitious target could be achieved is lacking. As such, the overarching objective of this study was to suggest a pathway for building a Green ICT Ecosystem. We reflect on our experience in building a green ICT ecosystem with the involvement of key ICT ecosystem stakeholders to adopt Green ICT practices. The lessons learned from creating a green IC ecosystem showed the importance of understanding stakeholders' diverse needs and challenges and consolidating numerous Green ICT approaches and strategies. We proposed a framework to serve as a guide for replication in other countries. To the best of our knowledge, this framework will likely be the first study to provide a blueprint for creating a Green ICT ecosystem to advance the convergence of ICT and stakeholder collaboration in archiving sustainable development.},

  abstract={This paper provides an extensive overview of cybersecurity awareness in the young, educated, and technology-savvy population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), compared to the United States of America (USA) for advancing the scholarship and practice of global cyber governance. We conducted comparative empirical studies to identify differences in specific human factors that affect cybersecurity behaviour in the UAE and the USA. In addition, we employed several control variables to observe reliable results. We used Hofstede’s theoretical framework on culture to advance our investigation. The results show that the targeted population in the UAE exhibits contrasting interpretations of cybersecurity awareness of critical human factors as compared to their counterparts from the USA. We identify possible explanations for this relatively different behaviour in the UAE population. Our key contributions are to provide valuable information for cybersecurity policymakers in the UAE and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region to further enhance cyber safety, governance, awareness, and trust among citizens.},

This article aims to reanalyze DAOs from the perspectives of organization and operation, and provide a more precise definition of DAOs as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations. Based on this, the fundamental principles and requirements of DAOs are explained, while the infrastructure based on cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) and parallel intelligence, as well as the supporting technologies, such as digital twins, metaverse, and Web3, are discussed. Besides, a five-layer intelligent architecture is presented, and the closed-loop equation and new function-oriented intelligent algorithms are also proposed. Moreover, the governance mechanisms from the individual, organizational and social perspectives are discussed, and the incentive mechanisms for the human, robot, and digital human are analyzed.

  abstract={This paper presents a multi-labeled semi-supervised study that includes a small labeled dataset and an unlabeled dataset. With the co-training framework, we combine a two-view semi-supervised learning for text classification by implementing two neural networks. As in the original co-training paradigm, the text is classified according to two independent learner views using two separate classifiers. In order to extend this idea to deep learning, the deep co-training model uses deep neural networks to train on different views of generated samples to calculate similarity in the probability distribution of predicted outcomes. This co-training framework depends on co-trained networks in order to classify text into multiple labels. Furthermore, the method adds noise to keep the classifier from being affected by it during prediction. As a result, such co-trained networks provide more relevant data and improve classification accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach, we compare it to state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning classifiers on a dataset of survivor stories of human rights violations.},

  pages={2149-2168},
  abstract={Failure to consider the characteristics, limitations, and abilities of diverse end-users during mobile app development may lead to problems for end-users, such as accessibility and usability issues. We refer to this class of problems as human-centric issues. Despite their importance, there is a limited understanding of the types of human-centric issues that are encountered by end-users and taken into account by the developers of mobile apps. In this paper, we examine what human-centric issues end-users report through Google App Store reviews, what human-centric issues are a topic of discussion for developers on GitHub, and whether end-users and developers discuss the same human-centric issues. We then investigate whether an automated tool might help detect such human-centric issues and whether developers would find such a tool useful. To do this, we conducted an empirical study by extracting and manually analysing a random sample of 1,200 app reviews and 1,200 issue comments from 12 diverse projects that exist on both Google App Store and GitHub. Our analysis led to a taxonomy of human-centric issues that characterises human-centric issues into three-high level categories: App Usage, Inclusiveness, and User Reaction. We then developed machine learning and deep learning models that are promising in automatically identifying and classifying human-centric issues from app reviews and developer discussions. A survey of mobile app developers shows that the automated detection of human-centric issues has practical applications. Guided by our findings, we highlight some implications and possible future work to further understand and better incorporate addressing human-centric issues into mobile app development.},

  abstract={At present, smart Homes are receiving more attention as they are becoming the predominant space that houses people’s activities. Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.},

  abstract={To specify good requirements, system analysts need to understand the domain knowledge of the system. There are several techniques in requirements elicitation to improve domain knowledge understanding, such as user interviews, questioners, document analysis, and brainstorming. Most of these techniques require profound stakeholder involvement. However, not all software projects can do this task due to limited time or availability of stakeholders. In agile software development, the user story is the de facto standard used for capturing and writing functional requirements. The user story is an appropriate format and easy to understand for writing the results of requirements elicitation. This study purposes a conceptual model to extract user story from online news for improving domain knowledge understanding. The information in the online news contained lesson learned related to certain events. This information may improve the functionality of the software products. The user story consists of three aspects, namely: who, what, and why. Aspect of who represents the role or user, aspect of what shows the purpose or feature, while the aspect of why explains the reason. This format can summarize the lessons learned in the news. Our experimental results indicate that this conceptual model can extract user story from online news. The model manages to extract 105 user stories from 92 aspects of what/why candidate and 109 aspects of who candidate.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the process of curriculum design in higher education to address the need for the development of digital competences of industrial engineers. In the light of digital transformation, an increasing amount of pedagogy literature, policy papers, and practitioners call for the development of digital competences. However, concrete approaches to tackle this issue in practice are still scarce. We followed a participatory action research approach together with stakeholders of a university of applied sciences to develop the foundations of a curriculum to equip engineering graduates with additional managerial, social, and psychological insights and approaches to succeed in digital transformation or Industry 4.0 projects in manufacturing companies. In several workshops with undergraduates, faculty, alumnae, researchers, and industry representatives the needs and prospective job profiles of such digital transformation managers were defined. The therefore required competences were prioritized applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by comparing the necessary knowledge, skills, as well as attitudes and values (KSA). The results first show difficulties in establishing a common understanding of required competences between the stakeholders due to the complexity of the notion of digital transformation. Nevertheless, the stakeholder involvement process and the AHP as decision support can serve as a suitable basis for the design process of engineering curricula, as well as in other contexts.},

  abstract={Efficiency monitoring is one of the important tasks in monitoring of employees activities, the solution of which is constantly in the focus of researchers and is still not supported by automated methods and universal tools. This task is especially relevant if the field of activity is narrowly specific, and solving such a task of efficiency monitoring is not a trivial accumulation of statistical data, but requires a unique method. However, potentially the method of evaluating the work efficiency of this specific field is not commonly used or adaptable in the analysis of a wide range of activities. The work of an engineering system designer is an example of such specific activities. This paper offers a method for construction of a unified model of behavior of users of specialized IT systems in the engineering design industry, which offers to evaluate the efficiency of work based on the development of a user profile that collects information about the designer's activities, sequence and times. The method defines the input data, the result output data, AI/ML algorithms for output data acquisition and is supported with the prototype system for the visual representation of the expected result, which is based on the input / output data regularities.},

To this end, we assessed publication and citation counts over time, authorship-level indicators, and keyword occurrence frequency. We also examined funding information as an indicator of research priorities, alongside usage-based statistics and alternative metrics such as social media mentions, recommendations, and reads. Our preliminary findings highlight a significant focus on aspects like trust, explainability, transparency, and autonomy in highly complex scenarios through the use of generative models and hybrid interaction techniques. The results also reveal a growth in the number of publications and funding grants, although a certain lack of maturity is observable in terms of citation patterns and coherence of thematic clusters.},

  abstract={This paper reports on a survey about the perceptions and practices of social media managers and experts in the area of public health. We have collected Facebook data from 153 public health care organizations and conducted a survey on them. 12% of organizations responded to the questionnaire. The survey results were combined with the findings from our previous work of applying clustering and supervised learning algorithms on big social data from the official Facebook walls of these organizations. In earlier research, we showed that the most successful strategy that leads to higher post engagement is visual content. In this paper, we investigated if organisations pursue this strategy or some other strategy that was successful and has not been uncovered by the machine learning algorithms. Performance of each organisation on Facebook is based on the number of posts (volume share) and the number of actions (value share). Calculation of performance with number of actions in the numerator and number of posts in the denominator reduces possible bias in the conclusions due to the varied size of organizations on social media. Moreover, our survey attempts to better understand the behaviour of organizations and to explain why almost half of the public health care content posted on Facebook is in the form of a short text message, where as the information can be communicated through seven other post types. Similar patterns and characteristics for different engagement clusters, also high and low performing companies suggests that a mixed-methods research approach consisting of machine learning techniques combined with expert knowledge using qualitative methods can offer important insights.},

Analytic Hierarchy Process is used as key component of the game engine, and enables an iterative prioritisation process. The GRP process has been evaluated through an exploratory case study, which has been conducted at a small software company, providing us with preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

  abstract={The detection of old submerged ammunition that is located on or below the seabed is an important preparatory work for offshore projects. Multibeam echosounder, side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler, and magnetometers are the sensor types that are most commonly used for the task. Survey design decisions center around both detection campaign efficiency and sufficient data quality to find specific reference objects. This article presents a comprehensive workflow for unexploded ordnance surveys in the sea and focuses on aspects of quantitative data quality control. For this purpose, data quality factors and corresponding threshold values were developed for each of the main sensor types. The authors designed and moderated a workshop-based stakeholder engagement process to establish expert consensus on suitable data quality factors and appropriate calculation of thresholds that define which data are sufficient and which are not. This approach was accompanied by a literature review of existing guidelines, standards, and survey recommendations. A quantitative description of data quality eases analyzing and comparing newly acquired and existing data. This article presents the results of this process, thereby providing guidance for the planning, execution, and quality control of a technical investigation with the aim of finding unexploded ordnance in the sea. The defined data quality factors derived from the literature review and collective expert knowledge can be used in the suggested workflow.},

  abstract={The widespread usage of the Internet and the abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have compelled higher education institutes (HEIs) worldwide to shift their academic and administrative affairs online. These unprecedented changes have caused issues in relation to trust, identity authentication, and stakeholder engagement that cripple HEIs' effective digitalisation of educational practices. Additionally, the ecosystem of HEIs has become more complex because it involves various heterogeneous information systems and the diverse demands of decentralised stakeholders, such as lecturers, students, and alumni. To address these emerging problems, blockchain has become a potentially disruptive technology that can facilitate practical innovation and provide opportunities for the re-engineering of traditional HEIs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to consolidate the fragmented knowledge of blockchain applications in higher education based on the current literature of related research domains, blockchain benefits, and additional challenges for future studies. The paper consists of a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines and an analysis of 79 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2018 and December 2022 by making an extensive literature search of Scopus, Taylor and Francis Online, and Web of Science databases. The results illustrate that blockchain is being explored and utilised to create new interventions to promote the sharing, securing, and management of data and knowledge and to enhance the coordination and trust between internal and external stakeholders of HEIs. This paper contributes to the stimulation of the awareness and interest of researchers and practitioners to leverage blockchain technology in their future work in order to facilitate the digital transformation of higher education.},

  abstract={With the development of new generation intelligent manufacturing and network technologies, the green manufacturing industry, represented by New Energy Vehicle (EV), is transforming to large-scale collaborative network production under regional industrial zone. It promotes the core manufacturing enterprises and related upstream and downstream enterprises to manage the massive, heterogeneous and scattered collaboration data for the whole life-cycle processes, namely design, manufacturing, services and sales, and thus to provide the collaborative services. However, the traditional data management manners are fixed, single and private, and mainly depend on data models and lack on-demand integration, which is unable to cope with the increasing demands for big data management and collaboration relations. Therefore, this paper focuses on EV domain, and studies on the new generation core enterprise-dominated collaborative dataspace management framework. Firstly, the data management requirements for the whole life cycle business collaboration of EV enterprises zone are given. Then, according to the requirements, the collaboration framework is developed, which includes resource layer, space layer, service layer and subject layer. Finally, the collaborative design case is applied to verify the feasibility and practicability of dataspace framework, which provides theoretical and application references for the data integration and management, and thus to urge the core enterprise-dominated whole life cycle business collaboration.},

  abstract={The decision-making process and the development of decision support systems (DSS) have been enhanced by a variety of methods originated from information science, cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence over the past years. Situated visualization (SV) is a method to present data representations in context. Its main characteristic is to display data representations near the data referent. As augmented reality (AR) is becoming more mature, affordable and widespread, using it as a tool for SV becomes feasible in several situations. In addition, it may provide a positive contribution to more effective and efficient decision-making, as the users have contextual, relevant and appropriate information to endorse their choices. As new challenges and opportunities arise, it is important to understand the relevance of intertwining these fields. Based on a literature analysis, this paper addresses and discusses current areas of application, benefits, challenges and opportunities of using SV through AR to visualize data in context and to support a decision-making process and its importance in future DSS.},

  abstract={Water distribution systems are one of the critical infrastructures and major assets of the water utility in a nation. The infrastructure of the distribution systems consists of resources, treatment plants, reservoirs, distribution lines, and consumers. A sustainable water distribution network management has to take care of accessibility, quality, quantity, and reliability of water. As water is becoming a depleting resource for the coming decades, the regulation and accounting of water in terms of the above four parameters is a critical task. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of a monitoring and controlling framework, capable of automating various stages of the water distribution processes. The current trending technologies such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to track this spatially varying network to collect, process, and analyze the water distribution network attributes and events. In this work, we investigate the role and scope of the IoT technologies in different stages of the water distribution systems. Our survey covers the state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems for the water distribution networks, and the status of IoT architectures for water distribution networks. We explore the existing water distribution systems, providing the necessary background information on the current status. This work also presents an IoT Architecture for Intelligent Water Networks - IoTA4IWNet, for real-time monitoring and control of water distribution networks. We believe that, these components need to be designed and implemented effectively to build a robust water distribution network.},

  abstract={The Industry 4.0 trend speeds up the adoption of a variety of technologies. In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the challenges posed by Industry 5.0.},

  abstract={The popularity of the Internet of Things allows the existence of many connected devices and thus, the quantity of data available is higher. However, many data are unusable if they are alone or out of context but a combination of these data can be valuable. This idea is also present in the information gathered by the human senses. The human body uses the senses to gather data about the environment in order to take the best possible decisions taking into consideration the whole environment. Our proposal is based on the same idea. We propose the creation of several subsystems that would simulate the human senses and another subsystem capable to manage them, and take decisions based on the data gathered by all subsystems. In this way, the data gathered by one subsystem would be complemented with the data gathered by the rest of systems as the human body does.},

  volume={11},

  pages={80680-80691},
  abstract={As each day passes by the world’s NT requirements increase due to increasing population and technological advancements. Currently, traditional technologies are inadequate to support the requirement. It is vital to investigate cost-effective and suitable green environmental technologies as a response. Future connectivity(5G, 6G), programming, artificial intelligence and new technologies might be a resolution to this resource crisis in this setting. Now, choosing amongst the most suitable option present itself as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) challenge in which a judgment must be made in terms of a wide variety of characteristics. In this paper, the extended MCDM strategies are proposed to optimizing new technologies implementation. The novelty of the Fuzzy Hypersoft (FHS) set is discussed, which can deal with uncertainties, vagueness, and unclear data. This framework is more flexible than the structures found in literature as it can deal with the information where the attributes can be further sub-partitioned into attribute values for a better understanding. It may not always be possible to analyze these criteria using precise figures; instead, an assessment must be made using human and expert judgments for a more adaptable and sensitive review. The adaptive MCDM design with fuzzy edges incorporates Entropy (EN), Similarity Measure (SIM), and TOPSIS techniques rely on FHS. The conveyed frameworks are better for probing NT issues because they analyze a more expansive range of attributes, which can handle a component with multiple different sub-attribute values. Expert ratings are used to demonstrate a practical application to highlight the relevance of the proposed approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the impact of primary criterion weights in sorting.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is the trend of today's industry. It integrates many new technologies such as Big data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, etc. One of the main important areas that are affected by this revolution is the manufacturing sectors. These technologies exist in the industrial field, and they have already served to upgrade the manufacturing process and to put it on the path of digitalization. Therefore, a new concept for smart manufacturing systems that are currently in use, who is the Digital Twin (DT) for manufacturing. It is a virtual reflection of a real element. It can be used to check the flexibility of the manufacturing layout, reproduce complex manufacturing systems and evaluate production efficiency in real time. The DT system allows us to test virtual scenarios, optimize and improve working conditions. It predict also what will happen in the real world. The application of DTs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is an important task. It has many advantages to improve the real-time status of machines and products. It ensures also, the continuity between the different areas of industry. The deployment of this concept in the manufacturing sector of an SME, requires the identification of techniques already deployed in the literature. In this paper, the main techniques used in the four layers of DTs, such as the cyber layer, the computing layer, physical layer, and the service layer are reviewed in detail. Their requirements and proposed solutions are also discussed. Another focus, is to provide a framework for the development of DTs for SMEs. On the basis of this framework, we focus on minimizing the costs of digitization. In future works, we aim to implement the proposed framework.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={115280-115305},
  abstract={Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising achievements in various computer vision tasks. However, designing a CNN model architecture necessitates a high-domain knowledge expert, which can be difficult for new researchers while solving real-world problems like medical image diagnosis. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an approach to reduce human intervention by automatically designing CNN architecture. This study proposes a two-phase evolutionary framework to design a suitable CNN model for medical image classification named TPEvo-CNN. The proposed framework mainly focuses on architectural depth search and hyper-parameter settings of the layered architecture for the CNN model. In the first phase, differential evolution (DE) is applied to determine the optimal number of layers for a CNN architecture, which enhances faster convergence to achieve CNN model architectures. In the second phase, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to fine-tune the hyper-parameter settings of the generated CNN layer architecture in the first phase. Crossover and mutation operations of GA are devised to explore the hyper-parameter search space. Also, an elitism selection strategy is introduced to select the potential hyper-parameters of the CNN architecture for the next generation. The suggested approach is experimented on six medical image datasets, including pneumonia, skin cancer, and four COVID-19 datasets, which are categorized based on image types and class numbers. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPEvo-CNN model compared to existing hand-crafted, pre-trained, and NAS-based CNN models in terms of classification metrics, confusion matrix, radar plots, and statistical analysis.},
