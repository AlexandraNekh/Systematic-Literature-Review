  abstract={This paper presents a visual analytics approach to analyzing a full picture of relevant topics discussed in multiple sources, such as news, blogs, or micro-blogs. The full picture consists of a number of common topics covered by multiple sources, as well as distinctive topics from each source. Our approach models each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched using a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop a level-of-detail (LOD) visualization that balances both readability and stability. Accordingly, the resulting visualization enhances the ability of users to understand and analyze the matched graph from multiple perspectives. By incorporating metric learning and feature selection into the graph matching algorithm, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result based on their information needs. We have applied our approach to various types of data, including news articles, tweets, and blog data. Quantitative evaluation and real-world case studies demonstrate the promise of our approach, especially in support of examining a topic-graph-based full picture at different levels of detail.},

  title={Self-Organized P2P Approach to Manufacturing Service Discovery for Cross-Enterprise Collaboration}, 
  year={2014},
  volume={44},
  number={3},
  pages={263-276},
  abstract={The combination of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture plays a promising role in distributed manufacturing environments in that the peer service can be used to facilitate the integration and discovery of distributed manufacturing resources and achieve communication and collaboration across distributed virtual enterprises. However, the large size, dynamic nature, and heterogeneous expression of distributed manufacturing resources bring forth a serious challenge in scalability and efficiency. This paper presents a self-organized P2P framework that supports scalable and efficient manufacturing service (MS) discovery for cross-enterprise collaboration by forming and maintaining autonomous enterprise peer groups (PG). Each enterprise exhibits as a peer that provides some sharable MSs that are represented comprehensively and formally with a generalized ontology. Each enterprise PG dynamically clusters a set of enterprise peers offering semantically similar MSs, and elects the most reputed peer through multicriteria trust evaluation as its core (i.e., super peer, SP). Then, a MS request can be first routed to the suitable SP and further to its leaf peer in a systematic way, thus supporting efficient service discovery. A prototype system is implemented on JXTA for real application and validated through an experimental case study.},

  year={2021},

  pages={76069-76082},
  abstract={Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.},

  abstract={A cybersecurity operations centre ontology for analysis (CoCoa) is proposed, which aligns to the NIST cybersecurity framework. CoCoa is a process ontology for the CSOC analysis processes that provides the cybersecurity analysts operational situational awareness of the vital aspects of the CSOC. The process ontology offers a fundamental shift from log collection to the analysis of five overarching threat intelligence and information sources (namely - events and logs, network information, structured digital feed, semi and un-structured feed and threat intelligence), which should allow the CSOC to provide proactive monitoring, detection of inflight, emerging and complex threats that would not have ordinarily been detected through only events and logs. Further, and most importantly, the proposed ontology is then used to identify how cyber incidents can be realised and detected through ontology-based knowledge graph.},

  abstract={Smart infrastructure has the potential to revolutionise how infrastructure is delivered, managed and automatically controlled. Data and digital twins offer an opportunity to enable this revolution and secure sustainable future smart infrastructure. In this article, we discuss data as an engineering tool and propose to use data throughout the asset's whole life cycle from identifying the need, planning and designing to construction, operation, integration and maintenance. This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making. An example systems architecture for integration of different digital twins is explained and benefits of this data-driven, systemic perspective are discussed.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Specifying system requirements (SysReqs) is a critical activity in complex systems development. The SysReqs and emerging architecture are constructed through gradual and iterative transition from the problem domain and operational stakeholder requirements to the conceptual solution domain. They later constitute the basis for functional requirements elaborating, concept formation, technology selection, function-to-form allocation, and asset utilization. Only rarely can stakeholder requirements (SHRs) readily translate to SysReqs. Systems engineers must therefore elicit, analyze, and evolve the SysReqs, as these will radically affect the system's performance, robustness, endurance, and appeal. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a framework for effective and consistent systems engineering and architecting. MBSE relies on modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM). OPM is a holistic MBSE paradigm and language for complex systems and processes, standardized as ISO 19450, which relies on the principle of minimal universal ontology. In this paper, we propose a model-based requirement engineering (MBRE) approach to facilitate the transition from SHRs to SysReqs, and from SysReqs to system architecture specification. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework in architecting a robotic baggage loading system for a leading international airport.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a way to improve the performance of prediction models (e.g., classifier) via the usage of unlabeled samples. An effective and widely used method is to construct a graph that describes the relationship between labeled and unlabeled samples. Practical experience indicates that graph quality significantly affects the model performance. In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance. In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle. We have developed a river visualization and a hybrid visualization that combines a scatterplot, a node-link diagram, and a bar chart to convey the label propagation of graph-based SSL. Based on the understanding of the propagation, a user can select regions of interest to inspect and modify the graph. We conducted two case studies to showcase how our method facilitates the exploitation of labeled and unlabeled samples for improving model performance.},

  abstract={The recently launched TATIN-PIC Project at the University of Technology of Compiègne is a multi-modal collaborative work environment for teams performing preliminary design. In this paper, we present the design and reasoning for the plans of our groupware system. Effective preliminary design teamwork requires alternating stages of discussion, exploration, and diverging ideas, coupled with stages of focus, decision-making, and convergence. We believe providing a design team with an interactive tabletop can fulfill the first role and an interactive whiteboard can satisfy the second. Users will be able to switch seamlessly between the two, shifting content from one to the other when necessary. In this paper, we begin with a discussion of the advantages and characteristics of preliminary design. We continue with a review of the state-of-the-art in interactive, board-sized surfaces. We discuss experiments and results from TATIN, the precursory project to TATIN-PIC. Finally, we introduce our plans for an innovative work environment. Its multi-agent software architecture will be capable of supporting voice commands, tablets, smartphones, and personalized assistants capable of ontological reasoning about the project work.},

  year={2014},
  volume={44},

  pages={1003-1014},
  abstract={We consider the problem of distributed collaboration among multiple agents in an ad hoc setting. We have analyzed this problem within a multiagent task execution scenario, in which every task requires collaboration among multiple agents to get completed. Tasks are also ad hoc in the sense that they appear dynamically and require different sets of expertise or capabilities from agents for completion. We model collaboration within this framework as a decision-making problem in which agents have to determine what capabilities to learn and from which agents to learn them so that they can form teams that have the capabilities required to perform the current tasks satisfactorily. Our proposed technique refers to principles from human learning theory to enable an agent to strategically select appropriate capabilities to learn from other agents. We also use two openness parameters to model the dynamic nature of tasks and agents in the environment. Experimental results within the Repast agent simulator show that by using the appropriate learning strategy, the overall utility of the agents improves considerably. The performance of the agents and their utilities are also dependent on the repetitiveness of tasks and reencounter with agents within the environment. Our results also show that the agents that are able to learn more capabilities from another expert agent outperform the agents who learn only one capability at a time from many agents, and agents who use an intelligent utility maximizing strategy to choose which capabilities to learn outperform the agents who randomly make the learning decision.},

  volume={14},

  pages={1297-1308},
  abstract={Cosimulation is an important system-level verification approach aimed at integrating multidomain and multi-physics models during complex system development. Currently, the lack of integrating system development process with cosimulations leads to gaps between them, decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of system development. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chains have been proposed to facilitate the integration of complex system development and automated verification using a model-based approach. However, due to the lack of formal and structured specifications, development information sharing is difficult for supporting MBSE facilitating automated cosimulations. In order to formalize cosimulation in an MBSE tool-chain, a scenario-based ontology is developed in this paper, using formal web ontology language (OWL). Ontology refers to a specification expressing the cosimulation implementations as well as the development information represented in the models supporting the MBSE. It is illustrated by a case study of a cosimulation based on Simulink. Protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) and semantic query-enhanced web rule language queries are proposed for evaluating the ontology's completeness and logic for supporting cosimulations. The result demonstrates that the scenario-based ontology formalizes the information related to automated cosimulation development and configurations while using the proposed MBSE tool-chain.},

  pages={2-13},
  abstract={In high-level-architecture (HLA)-based distributed heterogeneous collaborative engineering environments (CEEs), the construction of federation object model files is time consuming. This paper presents an ontology fusion approach aiming at establishing a common understanding in such collaborative environments. The proposed approach has three steps: ontology mapping, ontology alignment, and ontology merging. Ontology mapping employs a top-down approach to explore all bridge relations between two terms from different ontologies based on bridge axioms and deduction rules. Ontology alignment adopts a bottom-up approach to discover implicit bridge relations between two terms from different domain ontologies based on equivalent inference. Ontology merging generates a new collaboration ontology from discovered equivalent bridge relations. It adopts an axiom-based ontology fusion strategy and takes heavy-weighted ontologies into consideration. It can find all the explicit and derived interontology relations. In a typical CEE, the proposed approach has a great potential to improve the efficiency of preparation for HLA-based collaborative engineering processes, reduce the work load for adaptive adjustment of existing platforms, and enhance the reusability and flexibility of CEEs. A case study has been conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={Clinical data are crucial for any medical case to study and understand a patient's condition and to give the patient the best possible treatment. Pervasive healthcare systems apply information and communication technology to enable the usage of ubiquitous clinical data by authorized medical persons. However, quality of clinical data in these applications is, to a large extent, determined by the technological context of the patient. A technological context is characterized by potential technological disruptions that affect optimal functioning of technological resources. The clinical data based on input from these technological resources can therefore have quality degradations. If these degradations are not noticed, the use of this clinical data can lead to wrong treatment decisions, which potentially puts the patient's safety at risk. This paper presents an ontology that specifies the relation among technological context, quality of clinical data, and patient treatment. The presented ontology provides a formal way to represent the knowledge to specify the effect of technological context variations in the clinical data quality and the impact of the clinical data quality on a patient's treatment. Accordingly, this ontology is the foundation for a quality of data framework that enables the development of telemedicine systems that are capable of adapting the treatment when the quality of the clinical data degrades, and thus guaranteeing patients' safety even when technological context varies.},

  abstract={Deep design outlined in the paper is a new approach, where not only tasks, immediate emotions or habits and behaviours are considered. Deep design aims to identify sources of emotionally rich and strong experiences and feelings in order to augment them subsequently by means of smart technology. The most intrinsical needs of users, their deep needs, should be revealed and reflected in the process. Evaluation of a new technology is described as a successive process, starting with immediate decision, followed by short-term acceptance and finally long-term appropriation driven by the deep needs in a role of high order reinforcers. Deep design builds on various existing human-centric and emotion-driven approaches, but brings them further, or maybe rather deeper, bringing deep psycho-technical and socio-technical factors on the highest levels of importance. The idea of deep design is being introduced in a context of ambient technologies for elderlies, because actually there are certain dissonances in what do elderlies need and what many current intelligent technologies offer. As we show in the paper, our research in sources ranging from gerontology to ambient intelligence revealed four clusters of deep needs of elderlies-social touch, autonomy with anticipated support, feeling of being competent and feeling of helpfulness and self-worth.},

  abstract={Ambient awareness on a sidewalk is critical for safe navigation, especially for the people who are visually impaired. Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the “obstacles” on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency. We empirically evaluate a number of state-of-the-art architectures to choose the best model based on fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Finally, we built fully integrated IPSAD prototype on Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3). Audio feedback scheme were implemented to accommodate user preferences and personalization. We perform quantitative evaluation of the prototype system based on the accuracy of the model on Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk (AS) dataset, on-field system performance, data communication, response time (capturing images, recognition of obstacle and feedback), and failure points. Empirical evaluation showed that the accuracy of the model is 87% on the AS dataset and 78.75% on-field system. The system can operate either standalone mode when there is no Internet or cloud mode. In addition, the system can use human intelligence through crowd source and caregiver(s) to assist the users when automated system fails.},

  abstract={Gamification is maturing as an academic research object, but still suffers from growing pains. Challenges identified in a practical gamification activity are used to anchor a discussion of theoretical challenges currently facing gamification. We argue that some of the pain can be attributed to the exceptionalist and formalist definitions of game, and believe that these interpretations assume a dualistic ontological perspective of the world, resulting in problematic dichotomies. An alternative dialectical perspective from which to reimagine gamification and address some of the challenges is offered. This perspective is concretized through the lens of activity theory. The value of applying activity theory is illustrated by reflecting back on the practical and theoretical challenges identified. Reimagining gamification has the potential to afford participants with greater opportunities for action, and also to drive transformation of existing practices and thus enable agency. It is captured by considering it as an expansive cycle of activity.},

  abstract={As one of the most promising energy-efficient emerging paradigms for designing digital systems, approximate computing has attracted a significant attention in recent years. Applications utilizing approximate computing (AxC) can tolerate some loss of quality in the computed results for attaining high performance. Approximate arithmetic circuits have been extensively studied; however, their application at system level has not been extensively pursued. Furthermore, when approximate arithmetic circuits are applied at system level, error-accumulation effects and a convergence problem may occur in computation. Multiple approximate components can interact in a typical datapath, hence benefiting from each other. Many applications require more complex datapaths than a single multiplication. In this paper, a hardware/software co-design methodology for adaptive approximate computing is proposed. It makes use of feature constraints to guide the approximate computation at various accuracy levels in each iteration of the learning process in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The proposed adaptive methodology also considers the input operand distribution and the hybrid approximation. Compared with a baseline design, the proposed method significantly reduces the power-delay product while incurring in only a small loss of accuracy. Simulation and a case study of image segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

The AAS is used as information source to create an ontology, which is then used for security analysis. The paper discusses the use-case-specific modelling language selection and provides a practical examination of several of our implementations that use OWL and OPC UA together. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for the implementation of Asset Administration Shells for this and similar use cases.},

  abstract={Many chronic conditions can be better managed by patients themselves with the use of decision support tools. This becomes even more necessary in the case of multimorbidity (i.e. presence of multiple chronic diseases) or in conditions where several underlying risk factors need to be managed and monitored in order to avoid relapse or the reoccurrence of an event, like in the case of stroke. However, despite the fact that these decision support systems are becoming prevalent, little is known about the best practices in designing for end-users - patients and their carers. The aim of the present paper is to report on the process of involving users to inform the design of a novel data-driven self-management mobile decision support tool for stroke survivors, called CONSULT. User involvement was facilitated through the use of a two-phase participatory design approach. During both phases a total of 44 stakeholders participated, including stroke survivors, carers, healthcare professionals and researchers. The paper documents the findings of the participatory design process, in the form of design recommendations, and describes their implications for user interface design.},

  abstract={The level of similarity of knowledge work across occupations and industries allows for the design of supportive information and communication technology (ICT) that can be widely used. In a previous ethnographically informed study, we identified activities that can be supported to increase knowledge maturing, conceptualized as goal-oriented learning on a collective level. The aim of this paper is to investigate the current state of support and success of these knowledge maturing activities and to contrast them with their perceived importance, to identify those which have the highest potential for being supported by ICT. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through telephone interviews with representatives from 126 organizations throughout Europe in a sample stratified according to size, sector, and knowledge-intensity. The activities that appear to be most promising are “reflecting on and refining work practices and processes,” “finding people with particular knowledge or expertise,” as well as “assessing, verifying, and rating information.” Rich empirical material about how these activities are performed and also the issues that emerged and need to be managed were collected. Three clusters of organizations were identified: best performing organizations, people- and awareness-oriented organizations, and hesitant formalists. It was found that a balanced knowledge strategy that leaned toward personalization outperformed a codification strategy.},

  abstract={3D content of immersive virtual and augmented reality applications typically consists of objects that can interact with users and other objects. Interactions may be followed by changes of objects' properties, including their geometry, structure and appearance as well as high-level, domain-specific semantics. Logging interactions and temporal 3D content properties in a uniform, explorable way can be useful in various domains that involve multiple collaborating users and interacting objects, and can benefit from analysis of the users' and objects' behavior, e.g., in design, training, education, e-commerce, marketing and merchandising. However, the available approaches do not enable creation of explorable immersive VR/AR applications with regards to interactions and temporal 3D content properties. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to generating explorable interaction logs in immersive applications. The logs are ontologies compliant with the semantic web. Hence, the approach may be used with general or domain knowledge in a way intelligible to average users or domain specialists without expertise in IT. The approach is discussed in the context of a heterogeneous immersive environment, which combines diverse VR presentation and interaction devices to enable collaboration of multiple users within urban design.},

  pages={309-315},
  abstract={In semantics-based component retrieval ontology is usually employed as the semantic basis for component representation and matching. Existing methods always assume that the ontology already exists. However, ontology construction itself is a big challenge and the construction of ontology for component retrieval has its own characteristics differing from general domain ontology, including the emphasis on functional semantics, the explicit instance set (i.e. semantic descriptions of all the components stored in the repository) and the explicit objective of characterizing components for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an incremental and FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) based ontology construction method. The feature of incremental ontology construction means a collaborative and interactive process with component providers to collect basic input/output descriptions of components. FCA with the extension of hierarchical-valued concept context is adopted to elicit concepts from original component descriptions to construct ontological hierarchy for functional concepts. After concept analysis, semantic representation of each component can also be filled automatically. So our method can alleviate the efforts of ontology construction remarkably and the quality can also be ensured in terms of the requirements of component retrieval.},

In the service-oriented large-scale distributed computing environment characterized by openness, dynamism and uncertainty, the reliable service computation for cross-organizational workflow applications is facing some new challenges. Based on the theory of enterprise ontology, we propose a reliable service computing platform architecture for cross-organizational workflow applications. In this paper, we discuss the system realization detail. First, we propose a semantic ontology model EOM (Enterprise Ontology Model) considering workflow's QoS and the trust evolvement of cross-organizational workflow services to support the reliable service modeling of cross-organizational business process. We also introduce the flexibility simulation algorithm and pre-treatment scheduling emergency mechanism. After discussing selection of trustworthy cooperative enterprises for cross-organizational workflows, we give a case application on process modeling for cross-organizational e-Learning services.

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={124-131},
  abstract={In various time-slots, the real-time reasoning tasks generated by autonomous vehicles are scheduled within tolerance time, which is the key problem to be solved in autonomous driving. Tasks are traditionally scheduled on the on-board unit (OBU), which leads to long completion time of tasks. Heuristic algorithms are widely used in task scheduling problems, which usually causes to premature convergence. Scheduling tasks in edge environment can effectively reduce completion time of tasks. In this paper, a workflow scheduling strategy was designed in edge environment according to the difference of reasoning tasks and the changes of edge nodes in various time-slots. Firstly, the model of Markov decision process (MDP) was built to describe the problem scenario, and the completion time of reasoning tasks was calculated by the workflow scheduling algorithm. Secondly, the Q-learning algorithm based on simulated anealing (SA-QL) was proposed to optimize the completion time of reasoning tasks. Finally, the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms based on simulated annealing (SA-RL) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were comprehensively displayed from four perspectives: effectiveness, feasibility, exploration and convergence. The experimental results show that both SA-RL algorithms and PSO algorithm have good performance in feasibility and effectiveness. TD(0) algorithms have better performance of exploration and TD() algorithms have that of convergence.},

The configuration of the state of art and introduction of an architecture which can convert this organizational asset into an action such as "to introduce an added value" in the product life cycle is an interesting but challenging task. We in this study have discussed the issues related to enterprise collaboration for the purpose of assessment of an enterprise's capability.

  abstract={Distributed software system design is by nature an ill-defined or wicked problem. In order to learn to design them, the student must be presented with complex, open-ended problems for which there may be more than one correct solution. The decision-making strategies students acquired in previous courses are not effective when applied to large, complex problems of distributed systems. Students (novice designers) tend to think linearly and focus only on the problem at hand. They also tend to use trial-and-error strategies and they lack confidence in their design decisions. The purpose of the distributed systems' course is to create a learning approach that helps students to adopt and to apply expert design decision-making strategies. We use a case-based learning approach with classroom assessment techniques and rubrics to identify the critical weaknesses in the approaches that novices typically use when attempting to solve difficult design-oriented problems. The novice-oriented knowledge-based learning and application environment is supported by scaffoldings to incorporate expert strategies. In this paper, we describe the experience and the learning environment that provides the opportunities for professional development. We present and analyze our data comparing the students' outcomes over four terms, the time it takes to develop our students' expertise and how time spent with an expert (instructor) is crucial to an overall development.},

  abstract={The base learners and labeled samples (shots) in an ensemble few-shot classifier greatly affect the model performance. When the performance is not satisfactory, it is usually difficult to understand the underlying causes and make improvements. To tackle this issue, we propose a visual analysis method, FSLDiagnotor. Given a set of base learners and a collection of samples with a few shots, we consider two problems: 1) finding a subset of base learners that well predict the sample collections; and 2) replacing the low-quality shots with more representative ones to adequately represent the sample collections. We formulate both problems as sparse subset selection and develop two selection algorithms to recommend appropriate learners and shots, respectively. A matrix visualization and a scatterplot are combined to explain the recommended learners and shots in context and facilitate users in adjusting them. Based on the adjustment, the algorithm updates the recommendation results for another round of improvement. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate that FSLDiagnotor helps build a few-shot classifier efficiently and increases the accuracy by 12% and 21%, respectively.},

  abstract={By studying the NCS(networked control system) data transmission of multiple control loops, an algorithm based on multi-parameter fuzzy neural network (MP-FNN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the fuzzy rules given by expert experience, through the ability of self-learning, trained the fuzzy neural network and memorized the fuzzy control rules, and obtained the network demand of each control loop. Then, using the idea of real-time task scheduling, according to the idle time and the criticality of each control task, the urgency parameters of the loop control task are obtained from the defined fuzzy control rules. Finally, combining the urgency parameter and the network demand parameter of the control task, the dynamic weight algorithm is used to obtain the priority of each loop and adjust it online before the next sampling moment. This article uses Matlab's truetime toolbox for the establishment and simulation of NCS models, and anfis toolbox for fuzzy neural network training. Compared with several classic scheduling algorithms, it shows that the algorithm has a better improvement on the loop dynamic control performance.},

  abstract={Melanomas are the most dangerous form of skin cancer, accounting for a majority of mortality among all skin cancers. As melanomas tend to go unnoticed without constant supervision, it is important that steps are taken to identify and prevent their spread before they reach more severe stages. Many recent clinical trials and research have identified various indicators of melanoma that may be used for early detection. In this work, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to localize and detect one such indicator - a strong correlation between the number of pigmented freckles in a person's iris and their risk of developing melanoma on the skin. We model this task of detecting pigmented iris freckles as a single-class, one-sized object detection problem. For this, we propose Slim-YOLO, a lighter and simpler object detection model based on YOLOv3. The simplifications of Slim-YOLO are introduced through reducing the model computations by removing the need for multiple detection scales and classification. We also remove the constraints applied by anchor boxes. The experimental results show that Slim-YOLO is capable of achieving comparable performance (90.7% in mAP) with YOLOv3 (93.7%) while yielding a smaller model size of two-third the size of YOLOv3. These may prove highly beneficial to better facilitate deployment of the model on mobile devices in the future. Thus, we automate the iris freckle detection process successfully to help provide insights to practitioners, and contribute to the use of deep learning methods in detection of anomalies in medical imaging.},

  abstract={Radiography is one of the most widely used imaging techniques in the world. Since its inception, it has continued to evolve, leading to the development of intelligent and automated radiography systems that are able to perceive parts of their environment and respond accordingly. However, such systems do not provide a complete view of the examination space and are therefore unable to detect multiple objects and fully ensure the safety of patients, staff and equipment during the execution of the movement. In this paper, we present a system architecture based on ROS (Robot Operating System) to solve these challenges and integrate an autonomous X-ray device. The architecture retrieves point clouds from range sensors placed at specific locations in the examination room. By integrating different subsystems, the architecture merges the data from the different sensors to map the space. It also implements downsampling and clustering methods to identify objects and later distinguish obstacles. A subsystem generates bounding boxes based on the detected obstacles and feeds them to a motion planning framework (MoveIt!) to enable collision avoidance during motion execution. At the same time, a subsystem implements a deep neural network model (PointNet) to classify the detected obstacles. Finally, the developed system architecture provided promising results after being deployed in a Gazebo simulated examination space and on a use case test platform.},

Our approach focuses initially on the integration of unified modeling language (UML) with the formal requirements modeling language, knowledge acquisition in automated specification (KAOS), in order to help automate the detection of inconsistencies in UML designs thereby enhancing the quality of the original design and ultimately integrating the multiple views inherent in UML.

The framework is defined within the Model-driven Architecture and adapted to the multi-layer approach of the architecture. The data layer represents real world products, the model layer includes models of those products, and the meta-model layer defines the product modeling language. The semantic-based product modeling language described in this paper is specialized from a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the semantics of their product models explicitly and logically in an engineering-friendly way. The interactions between these three layers are described to illustrate how each layer in the framework is used in a product engineering context.},

  pages={4376-4394},
  abstract={In the past two decades, the use of ontologies has grown accompanied by a diversity in ontological representations and applications to more comprehensive domains. Knowledge engineers have found it expeditious to break down large (monolithic) ontologies to work with smaller fragments. Ontology modularization is the process of extracting a fragment, or ”module”, from an ontology, based on predefined requirements. Due to both the diversity in ontological representations and motivations for modularizing, the body of research on ontology modularization techniques has become extremely large and may be intimidating to the novice ontology researcher. The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive, albeit high-level, review of ontology modularization techniques. A systematic literature review covering January 1st 2000 to July 31st 2020 was performed to find and classify papers on ontology modularization techniques. The techniques exhibiting certain properties with respect to several features were assessed, and the modularization techniques were classified with a multi-dimensional perspective. The classifications are intended to guide one to a suitable modularization process in accordance with the requirements. The limitations of ontology modularization techniques are highlighted in the conclusion, and characteristics of a desirable framework for an ontology representation that would be best-suited for modularization are presented.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for Model-based Ontology Coverage Analysis (MOCA) and applies it to SysML models of mission architectures. An ontology is a set of concepts that constitute a common language, standard terminology, and consistent pattern reference across multiple models within an organization, industry, or domain. The purpose of MOCA is to assess the overlap between a system architecture model and a given ontology, and thereby the architecture model's compliance with the ontology and the ontology's utilization by the architecture. We demonstrate MOCA on a SysML model of a humanitarian airlift mission, using a conceptual mission architecting SysML profile model that serves as the ontology. MOCA automates and simplifies reasoning over models, and creates digital model-based artifacts that support stakeholders in concept validation, decision making, and system/mission design. Thus, MOCA enhances digital systems engineering.},

  abstract={The analysis of variance in complex text traditions is an arduous task when carried out manually. Text alignment algorithms provide domain experts with a robust alternative to such repetitive tasks. Existing white-box approaches allow the digital humanities to establish syntax-based metrics taking into account the spelling, morphology and order of words. However, they produce limited results, as semantic meanings are typically not taken into account. Our interdisciplinary collaboration between visualization and digital humanities combined a semi-supervised text alignment approach based on word embeddings that take not only syntactic but also semantic text features into account, thereby improving the overall quality of the alignment. In our collaboration, we developed different visual interfaces that communicate the word distribution in high-dimensional vector space generated by the underlying neural network for increased transparency, assessment of the tool’s reliability and overall improved hypothesis generation. We further offer visual means to enable the expert reader to feed domain knowledge into the system at multiple levels with the aim of improving both the product and the process of text alignment. This ultimately illustrates how visualization can engage with and augment complex modes of reading in the humanities.},

  abstract={One of the main challenges in providing intelligent support to learners is the establishment of the learner's context. Most of the work done in this area is based on modelling an individual learner's context without considering the learner's interaction with other people. We consider a mobile collaborative learner's context where the learner is mobile and interacts with others in continuing her learning process. In this paper, we analyse the context of a mobile collaborative learner in an ambient intelligent environment by using a simple scenario. We examine the literature on context models in the area of context aware computer systems to see if the context model for a mobile collaborative learner in an intelligent environment can be supported by the currently available models. This paper discusses the context of a mobile collaborative learner in an ambient intelligent environment. This work uses an existing knowledge-based context model to evaluate if this model is applicable to mobile collaborative learners. We believe that the analysis presented in this paper highlights some of the issues in modelling the context for mobile collaborative learners. We also hope to identify weaknesses and strengths in existing context models and hope to provide some directions for better support for modelling the context of mobile collaborative learners},

  abstract={Systems developed without addressing subjective experience can generate interactions successful in their tasks but counterproductive as experiences. Addressing subjective experience requires creating hypothetical situations with realistic human actors, subjectivity's embodied nature prevents examination in isolation from either person or context. The Contextual Scenario Framework (CSF) assists in the systematic creation of scenarios incorporating subjective experience. It supports structuring, management and reuse of discoveries from domain research, enabling authors to weave contextual information throughout scenario development. This paper extends the CSF in three ways: relating it to structural features of subjective consciousness, formalizing the model for implementation, and increasing linkages between scenarios and field data. A demonstration case starts with a generic event sequence from a Use Case. The scenario written using the CSF intermingles the source sequence with field-research learnings to explore the subjective experiences of two human actors, addressing the question, "What might happen in the real world?".},

  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Current concerns regarding an efficient water resource management have highlighted the necessity of top-down and bottom-up interjurisdictional alliances that aim to collectively improve the status of the watershed and the search for sustainable solutions. Acute problems are triggered by direct (land use change) or indirect (climate change, legislation) human interventions in the natural systems within which we live. Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. Effective watershed management requires information-rich communication among central and local authorities, private industry, citizens, and academia. Effective watershed planning, regulation and management also require timely conveyance of information to agency staff, decision makers, and the public. Customized Decision Support Systems (DSS) are required for this purpose, to provide wide access to workflows to query, visualization, and compare vital information. DSS can use basically the same information for strategic or emergency planning if the access to the data, simulations, and workflow operation can be done in real-time. It is the duty of public and private sectors to determine how to effectively support the decision-making process without neglecting the appropriate amount of evaluation and the inclusion of stakeholders in the process. The paper presents a concept for interjurisdictional collaboration in water resources management, using a DSS platform that integrates the data and information needed to support short- and long-term watershed actions. The focus of the paper is on describing an ontological framework which combines representative actors/stakeholders, hydrologic concepts and relationships with elements of offering an integrated approach to complex water related processes.},

  abstract={Exergames combine physical exercises and games. Thorough knowledge about the physical exercises is crucial in designing efficient exergames. Expert involvement in the design process, in this case with physiotherapists, is an efficient way to gather and retain domain specific knowledge for the design team. However, experts rarely have experience exploring design alternatives in a playful way, which is important when participating on the co-design of serious games like exergames. We explored the question: How can we involve experts to share and professionally explore their domain specific knowledge in a play-centric game design process? We present two co-design exergame workshops with physiotherapists. Based on lessons learned from the first workshop, we explored in the second workshop framing the entire workshop process as a game. We found that gamifying the workshop process into a design game provided a way to change the experts' effective-oriented mindset into a playful mindset. This article demonstrates some lessons learned from this process of creating and using such a method and proposes some directions for future research and applications.},

It adopts an axiom-based deduction ontology fusion strategy, and takes heavy-weighted ontologies into consideration. It can find all the explicit and derived inter-ontology relations, and furthermore it reaches the active upper bounds of implicit equivalent inter-ontology relations searching. This paper also discusses some implementation issues on the basis of TH_RTI, a RTI (Run Time Infrastructure) version developed by National CIMS ERC, Tsinghua University. The proposed approach has great potential to improve the efficiency of ontology-based federated collaboration executions, reduce the work load for adaptive adjustment of ever-existing platforms, and enhance the applicability and flexibility of collaborative product development systems.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) mobile communication technology, companies continue to file for new patents or obtain licenses from patent assignees to secure the right to use LTE-A related intellectual properties (IPs) for product commercialization. There are many standard essential patents (SEPs) complying with LTE-A specifications set by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). LTE-A patent pools are collaborative efforts to gather SEPs from IP owners to reduce the process time of SEP licensing for manufacturers. This research develops the computer supported analysis process for the comparative study of two major LTE-A patent pools (i.e., Sisvel and Via Licensing). The first step is to search the ETSI database for LTE-A SEPs. The second step analyzes the patents in both pools based on IPC classification and LTE-A ontology definition. The main goal of the research is to reveal the patent profiles of LTE-A patent pools for collaborative and collective SEP licensing, which enables LTE-A technology developers and adopters (such as mobile device manufacturers) to fully cooperate in new product development and commercialization efficiently and economically.},

  abstract={Despite of the rapid development of computer science and information technology, human-machine integrated design of complex mechatronic products is still not fully accomplished, partly because of the inharmonious communication among collaborators. Therefore, one challenge in human-machine integration is how to establish an appropriate knowledge management (KM) model to support integration and sharing of heterogeneous product knowledge. Aiming at the diversity of design knowledge, this paper proposes an ontology-based model to reach at an unambiguous and normative representation of the knowledge. Firstly, an ontology-based human-machine integrated design framework is described, then corresponding ontologies and sub-ontologies are established according to different purposes and scopes. Secondly, a similarity calculation-based ontology integration method composed of ontology mapping and ontology merging is introduced. The ontology searching-based knowledge sharing method is then developed. Finally, a case of human-machine integrated design of a large ultra-precision grinding machine is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Riva is a Business Process Architecture (BPA) modelling approach that has been used to model key business processes for specific organizational boundaries based on the brainstorming of Essential Business Entities (EBEs). During its early stages, Riva relies heavily on brainstorming the EBEs from stakeholders. However, it does not provide a systematic process for deriving generalized BPA models from multiple heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, when deriving processes from the identified Riva-EBEs, Riva identifies Case Processes (CPs), Case Management Processes (CMPs), and Case Strategy Processes (CSPs). However, the Riva literature mainly supports modelling the CPs, CMPs, and the relationships between them. It does not focus on modelling the CSPs nor their related relationships. Accordingly, Riva has been semantically-enriched by the srBPA ontology component. But this semantic enrichment was limited to the original aspects of Riva and does not address the raised issues. This paper presents an adaptation to the semantic enrichment of Riva (an adapted srBPA ontology) to include the semantic representation of the CSPs and their related relationships, in addition to supporting the representation of BPA concepts and resolving semantic heterogeneity resulting from electing the EBEs from multiple heterogeneous sources. The proposed adapted ontology has been evaluated by checking its consistency, completeness, and redundancy.},

There is also a growing interest in accounting for human values and norms. This paper takes a universal perspective informed by discourse ethics and it argues that value and norm issues cannot be fully resolved in the design process and that they require the continuous participation of users in use time. On the other hand, the increasing complexity in global contexts necessitates exploiting machine intelligence to adapt the system behavior to the interaction context. This paper comments on two complementary reflective principles for interactive systems (i.e., the meta-adaptation and meta-communication principles) and argues that both principles need to be implemented as system's features to support computer's as well as users' reflections.},

  abstract={The essence of knowledge representation learning is to embed the knowledge graph into a low-dimensional vector space to make knowledge computable and deductible. Semantic indiscriminate knowledge representation models usually focus more on the scalability on real world knowledge graphs. They assume that the vector representations of entities and relations are consistent in any semantic environment. Semantic discriminate knowledge representation models focus more on precision. They assume that the vector representations should depend on the specific semantic environment. However, both the two kinds only consider knowledge embedding in semantic space, ignoring the rich features of network structure contained between triplet entities. The MulSS model proposed in this paper is a joint embedding learning method across network structure space and semantic space. By synchronizing the Deepwalk network representation learning method into the semantic indiscriminate model TransE, MulSS achieves better performance than TransE and some semantic discriminate knowledge representation models on triplet classification task. This shows that it is of great significance to extend knowledge representation learning from the single semantic space to the network structure and semantic joint space.},

This paper considers that this trade-off poses a dilemma and raises the question of how to achieve governance that promotes biotechnological innovation and research while protecting the fundamental rights and values of individuals and groups. The aim of this paper is to explore regulatory instruments in the EU data protection law that can strike a balance between innovation and protection in the governance of human biodata. To this end, it focuses on meta-regulation as a regulatory technique and examines data protection impact assessment (DPIA) as a method for addressing the tension between innovation and protection. Based on doctrinal legal analysis, it argues that while DPIA is a useful instrument to seek a solution in this dilemma, further reflection and clarification are needed to improve the methods of conducting the impact assessment.},

We apply the hierarchical clustering technique on the data instances and use the clusters in the further analysis to reduce the cost of processing a large amount of data. The matching of schema elements is based on the probability distribution of the data instances. The preliminary results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract={The adoption of AI in the health sector has its share of benefits and harms to various stakeholder groups and entities. There are critical risks involved in using AI systems in the health domain; risks that can have severe, irreversible, and life-changing impacts on people’s lives. With the development of innovative AI-based applications in the medical and healthcare sectors, new types of risks emerge. To benefit from novel AI applications in this domain, the risks need to be managed in order to protect the fundamental interests and rights of those affected. This will increase the level to which these systems become ethically acceptable, legally permissible, and socially sustainable. In this paper, we first discuss the necessity of AI risk management in the health domain from the ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. We then present a taxonomy of risks associated with the use of AI systems in the health domain called HART, accessible online at https://w3id.org/hart. HART mirrors the risks of a variety of different real-world incidents caused by use of AI in the health sector. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the taxonomy for different stakeholder groups and further research.},

  abstract={This article aims to improve learning by proposing a process to design a serious game as an environment where the player deduces knowledge through the challenges of the game, using the knowledge to be acquired as a strategy. The proposed process is a combination of the Good Principles of Learning based on video games and the Knowledge Generation Model for Visual Analytics. Taking into account the proposed method, a design will be generated that uses the game mechanics to collect data, measure and evaluate the change in player behavior within the game in relation to the different game states.},

  abstract={Knowledge sharing is an essential factor to build virtual collaboration across organizations. Therefore, from the product design point of view, identifying required product knowledge is a very important thing. This product knowledge is closely related with product requirements and functions. However the type of knowledge and information of product, needed in virtual collaboration, is still not comprehensively explored and understood. The main purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify generic product knowledge and information to support knowledge sharing in a virtual collaboration environment. In this paper we propose a methodology for identification and modeling of product information, based on the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) principle. The FBS principle was then translated into classification of product information. The classification can give a comprehensive view of a product. The flexibility of classification developed in this research makes it easier to be implemented across various different type of product. It also provides a better understanding about the products and its subcomponents. The identification of product information was followed by translation of it into a model. A model of generic product information was successfully built. Further research is planned towards developing a combined graphical and ontological product information model based on FBS principles.},

The proposed runtime infrastructure is designed and constructed on the basis of TH_RTI, a runtime infrastructure version developed by National CIMS ERC, Tsinghua University. The proposed software firmly supports federation collaboration ontology playing its proper role in federation development and execution process. And the same time it can support execution of overlapping federations, which can greatly improve execution efficiency and resource utilization of federated collaborations. The proposed approach has great potential to improve efficiency of ontology-based federated collaboration executions, reduce the work load ever-existing platforms, and enhance the applicability and flexibility of collaborative product development systems.},

  pages={1033-1044},
  abstract={Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning (DL) approaches have resulted in the dynamic generation of trace links that are far more accurate than was previously possible. However, DL-generated links lack clear explanations, and therefore non-experts in the domain can find it difficult to understand the underlying semantics of the link, making it hard for them to evaluate the link's correctness or suitability for a specific software engineering task. In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the correctness of the link.},

  abstract={This paper reviews current publications and the concept of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in future wireless networks. The unpredictable fading of wireless channels has become one of the most significant performance bottlenecks. The IRS consists of many metasurface devices that may be individually adjudicated to add phase changes to signal reflections. It may actively alter the signal propagation parameters in favor of signal reception and achieve the idea of a smart radio environment. In this survey, we first introduce essential concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its configurability. Then, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS’s phase control and the transceivers’ transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., capacity maximization and energy minimization problems; beamforming discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks, and using the deep learning method for discussion in IRS. Finally, we highlight some interesting practical challenges, such as security transmission, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and mm-Wave communication.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={84-91},
  abstract={SaaS CRM tools typically contain a rich repository of conversations between sales agents and prospective customers until the sales deal is won or lost. These conversations can occur over different channels such as email, chat, and voice calls. In such settings, conversation context and product purchase intent are spread across tens of message exchanges. To accurately predict the probability of a deal win, it is important to build classification models that capture such context continuity across a long chain of message exchanges. While past BERT-based work on modeling multi-turn conversations captures context history, they fall short when applied directly to sales negotiations which are not strictly multi-turn in nature, contain long messages, and are often interspersed with irrelevant “noise”. Additionally, extracting and communicating pivotal phrases in a customer message is a crucial undertaking as a part of model explainability. This requires additional attention to augmentation mechanisms keeping in mind the same context continuity. In this paper, we present a BERT-based novel architecture to achieve the above goals of conversation classification and prediction explainability. We train this architecture on a corpus of email exchanges available internally. Our architecture relies on a BERT-based multi-task training regimen trained for two tasks-one learns to predict deal closure from an email chain, and the other learns to extract multiple key-phrases from individual emails. The BERT setup also learns from short-term context to build email representations, which are further enhanced with extracted key-phrases using an attention-over-attention mechanism. Finally, Bi-LSTM layers capture long-term context across all phrase-enhanced emails in the conversation to predict deal closure. Experimental results demonstrate a~14-15% improvement in deal conversion accuracy and~10-12% improvement in Jaccard score for extracted phrases, outperforming our baseline model.},

  abstract={As well as in traditional software engineering, reuse is a key factor for the efficient and efficacious construction and evolution of complex Web applications. Efficaciously integrated in the development process and supported by an appropriate framework, reuse significantly increases development speed, application quality and, by enabling rapid prototyping, improves stakeholder communications. Although reuse aspects in traditional software engineering have been thoroughly investigated, their successful adoption to the Web Engineering domain still remains nontrivial leaving room for dedicated Web-specific solutions. Beyond that, current consolidation activities in the Web Engineering community underline the significance of a unifying solution. To this end, we present a comprehensive ontology-based Web Engineering reuse approach that establishes a common basis for cross-methodology reuse strategies and emphasizes stakeholder collaboration. To unfold the full potential of reuse, it incorporates both planned and spontaneous reuse strategies. We point out the approach’s extensibility and applicability for cross-methodological Web Engineering and demonstrate how it considerably accelerates development speed and improves stakeholder communications.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={38296-38317},
  abstract={Background: Robust and useful tools for exploratory analysis in biosciences are still lagging behind the size and complexity of the biological datasets produced since the completion of the human genome in 2000. A possible reason is that developers are unlikely to understand domain and case-specific requirements of existing research questions. Methods: We formed a design team comprising a visualization expert, a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, bioinformatics domain experts, and the Principal Investigator (PI) as a `facilitator' filling the communication gap between them. We implemented co-design methodology. Results: We identified the need for an interactive visual analytic tool for exploratory analysis of biological data. We describe the process of developing MAHiCGO, a novel tool for the simultaneous visualization of MA Gene Expression data, Hi-C data and Gene Ontology (GO) information in an interactive manner for the exploratory analysis of biological data. Conclusion: The key finding of this research to include a facilitator role in the co-design is useful in the evolving fields of design research and of bioinformatics, merging computational sciences with biosciences. The findings support in understanding new functional roles in the field of design, in particular design of computer applications in highly complex domains such as bioinformatics, and for highly complex tasks such as exploratory tasks. The findings also stress on the key role of visualization to expand user cognitive capabilities, and of co-design for constant engagement of domain experts in the creation process.},

  abstract={During the last decade, cultural heritage has moved toward the encoding of information in semantic format. Ontologies make the description of artworks clearer, unambiguous and often self-explanatory, with advantages in terms of interoperability.

In order to illustrate this approach, we describe a case study in ontologies and visualization for cultural heritage, Labyrinth. In Labyrinth, the user is immersed in a 3D labyrinth where turning points and paths represent a set of cultural artifacts and the semantic relations holding among them.},

Based on the new requirements of collaborative design process, a strategy of CPD based on the modularity thought and multi-agent technology is proposed. Firstly, the model of agent for CPD is constructed. And on the basis of the traditional methods of modularity, an agent-based modular decomposition method is presented. Secondly, the best matching agent is selected to solve the module by counting the integrated similarity degree between the task set of modules and the agent experiences set. And making use of the black-board mechanism the collaborative environment is achieved to support the multi-agent collaborative work. Finally, an agent-based automobile collaborative R&D platform is developed. The rationality and effectiveness of this methodology is proved in an instance of collaborative design of automobile body.},

This paper presents an immersive virtual reality application using a wine farm as a case study. The developed farm marketing application used participatory design and SCRUM methodology to showcase a wine farm and the wine production process. The application provides a virtual walk-through of the vineyards (lookout point), the lodge, the community garden, the conference facilities, as well as the cellar in 3D 360-degree rendering. Current basic 360-degree exploration applications exist but none have incorporated 3D 360-degree exploration as presented in the current research.

  abstract={More and more people are collecting, organizing, and interpreting health data through off-the-shelf products such as Apple's Health Kit. People use these systems to collect steps taken, calories ingested, etc. These ecosystems also support the collection of physiological data. For example, users collect heart rate data during exercise, and even electro dermal activity data to help detect the onset of seizures. Analyzing physiological data, however, and relating it to specific behaviors or events, is challenging. In this paper, we present an 11-week, multi-session, participatory design case study, identify challenges in analyzing physiological and behavior data, and present BEDA, an analytics tool we developed to mitigate the challenges. The two primary data analysis challenges include: (1) interfacing multiple software programs required for capturing and analyzing the different data sources, and (2) extending the limited data analysis functionality within and across these software programs to support a wide range of physiological data analyses. BEDA resolves the fragmented analysis pipeline by integrating closely-related analysis tasks into a common interface. It also addresses the extensibility problem by integrating scripts that apply any custom or publicly-available function written in MATLAB or R. These scripts extend basic analytic capability, provide the analytic bridge between physiological and behavior data, and incorporate machine learning algorithms to highlight behaviors associated with physiological data. BEDA's capabilities mitigated the challenges of signal analysis and fragmented data sources, and motivated behavioral scientists to combine physiological measures with behavioral analysis. Although we developed this tool for a domain-specific case study, the use of the tool can be generalized to analyze any time-based data source or sources.},

Since the graduate programs of computing and engineering mostly provide broader education, the graduates from these programs lack relevant clinical perspectives, necessary to work in- and advance the domain of medical computing. Likewise, the graduates from clinical and medical programs are often missing up-to-date computing skills, essential to comprehend and manage the fast-developing industry of medical computing technology. By implementing the processes of funnelling industrial and clinical aspects, we ensure that the graduates are equipped with relevant knowledge, and become a part of germane networks.

  abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) is a core corporate activity responsible for moving commodities and services from one point to another through a variety of stakeholders. The traditional SCM is based on a centralized approach managed at the central headquarter, and all other sub-offices get instructions from the main office. Some major issues with present SCM systems are security, transactional transparency, traceability, stakeholder involvement, product counterfeiting, additional delays, fraud, and instabilities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data and build trust efficiently and transparently. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments without a third party. To address the present SCM issues, BC technology is a feasible solution. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, in this paper, we present a survey on the adoption of BC in SCM. This paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the literature on BC characteristics, implementations, and business consequences in various SCM. This Blockchain-centered study, in particular, discloses the research state and delineates future research directions by studying and analyzing 97 up-to-date publications highlighting BC’s supply chain uses. Transparency and traceability, information sharing, product anti-counterfeiting, and building trust are the major aspects propelling BC’s implementation in SCM. Further, we analyzed various applications of SCM in which BC can be used as a probable technology to secure all transactions. Then, we have highlighted open issues and research challenges for adopting BC technology in SCM that open the doors for beginners eager to start work in this amazing area.},

However, to date there exists no central concept of what the most useful educational approaches are in RE education in order to best interweave theory with practice. To lay the foundation for this important mission, we conducted a systematic literature review.

  abstract={To assist and protect citizen communities and police officers, robots have been developed for situational responses (e.g., explosive ordinance disposal). However, the robots used by law enforcement are typically expensive, can be difficult to operate, and do not readily facilitate communication between individuals. Recent research by the authors examined how communication impacts trust between robots and humans in the context of law enforcement. Using a mobile communication robot, law enforcement officers (LEOs) reported high levels of trust because the robot provided near face-to-face interaction using screens, microphones, and speakers. This paper seeks to expand upon the previous findings by discussing public perception, privacy, safety, and ethical considerations as they pertain to communication robots utilized in law enforcement. In the following, the authors explain their primary research thrusts and provide their plan for expanded stakeholder involvement for future research.

  abstract={Hybrid Simulation (HS) is the application of two or more simulation techniques (e.g., ABS, DES, SD) in a single M&S study. Distinct from HS, Hybrid Modelling (HM) is defined as the combined application of simulation approaches (including HS) with methods and techniques from the broader OR/MS literature and also across disciplines. In this paper, we expand on the unified conceptual representation and classification of hybrid M&S, which includes both HS (Model Types A-C), hybrid OR/MS models (D, D.1) and cross-disciplinary hybrid models (Type E), and assess their innovation potential. We argue that model types associated with HM (D, D.1, E), with its focus on OR/MS and cross-disciplinary research, are particularly well-placed in driving innovation in the theory and practice of M&S. Application of these innovative HM methodologies will lead to innovation in the application space as new approaches in stakeholder engagement, conceptual modelling, system representation, V&V, experimentation, etc. are identified.},

  abstract={Engineering firms continue to adopt the practice of virtual teams, which face unique challenges and require additional management considerations than co-located teams. While virtual teams offer incentives in terms of flexibility and cost savings, engineering firms should be aware of added challenges that yield low-performing teams or result in failure. These challenges, in essence, are driven by the geographic dispersion of members, core reliance on communication technology, and composition of various cultures. The subject research follows a highly practical approach, providing specific practices for mitigation of the identified challenges. A survey study was conducted to gather data from engineering practitioners at a global professional services firm involved in virtual engineering projects between 2017 and 2018. Research conducted across best practices for virtual teams, coupled with the survey results, yielded a framework of five overarching themes to enable high-performing virtual engineering teams: technology integration, management of virtual resources, project governance controls, stakeholder engagement, and organizational drivers. Resulting practices are presented across the five themes of the framework. The findings should be leveraged by engineering and technology professionals involved in virtual projects, along with leaders and firm executives seeking improved performance of their virtual teams.},

  abstract={Less than 3% of the 145 million blind people living in developing countries are literate. This low literacy rate is partly due to the lack of trained teachers and the challenges associated with learning to write Braille on a traditional slate and stylus. These challenges include writing from right to left, writing mirrored images of letters, and receiving significantly delayed feedback. Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind near Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost Braille writing tutor. We present an iterative and participatory design process resulting in the creation and refinement of a prototype Braille writing tutor system. This system uses a novel input device to capture a student's activity on a slate using a stylus and uses a range of techniques to teach Braille writing skills to both beginner and advanced students. We report on lessons learned from the implementation of this project and from a six-week pilot study at the Mathru school, and outline future directions for improvement.},

We have been combining text-mining and visualization techniques to facilitate big data analysis in human rights research. Taking a user-centered approach, we first surveyed the human rights research literature to understand reported data analysis practices in the field, and then taking a participatory design approach working with oral history researchers to develop a visual analytical tool that facilitates the analysis of collections of audio-video interviews oral history research projects. In this paper we present our current prototype - Clock-based Keyphrase Map (CKM). CKM utilizes Keyphrase technique to identify important topics in the collection and a clock-based visualization to present them in a temporal order. CKM also enables the users to further analyze the collections and share their analysis process with other researchers. We discuss the tool in details including its architecture, the computational and visualization techniques, and the interaction features. Our future plan on evaluation and further development are also discussed in the paper.},

  abstract={Elicitation studies have become a popular method of participatory design. While traditionally used to examine unimodal gesture interactions, elicitation has started being used with other novel interaction modalities. Unfortunately, there has been no work that examines the impact of referent display on elicited interaction proposals. To address that concern this work provides a detailed comparison between two elicitation studies that were similar in design apart from the way that participants were prompted for interaction proposals (i.e., the referents). Based on this comparison the impact of referent display on speech and gesture interaction proposals are each discussed. The interaction proposals between these elicitation studies were not identical. Gesture proposals were the least impacted by referent display, showing high proposal similarity between the two works. Speech proposals were highly biased by text referents with proposals directly mirroring text-based referents an average of 69.36% of the time. In short, the way that referents are presented during elicitation studies can impact the resulting interaction proposals; however, the level of impact found is dependent on the modality of input elicited.},

  abstract={Non-anthropomorphic robots can be cost-effective and efficient choice in certain context in comparison to social or humanoid robots. However, introduction of nonanthropomorphic robots can evoke uncertainty and anxiety due to novelty of technology. The goal of this paper is to explore personality design space for non-anthropomorphic wellness robots in office environment to foster acceptance among users. Through Participatory Design approach, we explored appropriate personalities for a well-being robot, which would detect employees’ sitting posture and suggest small wellness interventions. We addressed the following research questions: (i) How can personalities be designed and integrated to non-anthropomorphic wellness robots to promote users’ acceptance? (ii) How do the users perceive designed personalities of non-anthropomorphic wellness robot in the office context? We conducted one contextual inquiry (n=5) and one co-design workshop (n=15) followed by evaluation (n=5) in IT office environment with office employees. As a contribution to the paper, we present personalities and design implications for non-anthropomorphic wellness robot in the office context. Our contribution will serve as a guideline for designers to explore and expand their knowledge on designing robot personalities for non-anthropomorphic robots in the context.},

  abstract={In the field of human-robot interaction (HRI), assistive robots have been integrated to promote social interactions and physically active lifestyles in the wellness context of eldercare. Despite their potential benefits, the current applications of assistive robots are constrained by limited usage environments and their predefined roles. Our research aims to explore older adults’ perceptions of assistive robots and approaches for delivering motivational physical activities by integrating, Spot, a zoomorphic mobile robot, as an outdoor walking guide. We conducted a participatory design study at a Finnish nursing home, consisting of three phases: the co-design workshop, the conceptual design, and the field study. This qualitative research collected data through observations and interviews. The findings report positive attitudes and natural social interactions among older adults during the outdoor physical activities assisted by the Spot robot. Based on these findings, we present a set of design implications for wellness robots in eldercare, including robot roles and tasks, methods for introducing robot literacy, and approaches to presenting robotic solutions to older adults.},

  abstract={The global challenges posed by the simultaneous de-mographic transitions of urbanisation and ageing have prompted the World Health Organisation to develop the Age-Friendly City (AFC) approach. This approach, however, is overly reliant on spatial solutions to effectively respond to a wicked problem which has no obvious terminating condition, requires continuous adaption as needs, values and contributions change, and is highly dependent on an equitable distribution of resources. To address this, the paper explores the development of a methodology for a socio-technical system (STS) that facilitates the creation of an AFC in a borough of Central London. However, it is concluded that such a methodology cannot yet be operationalised and requires the expansion of STS theory to include a spatial dimension, the development of an effective participatory design methodology, and a focus on contributive justice to ensure meaningful participation.},

  abstract={Law enforcement and domain experts can detect human trafficking (HT) in online escort websites by analyzing suspicious clusters of connected ads. How can we explain clustering results intuitively and interactively, visualizing potential evidence for experts to analyze? We present TrafficVis, the first interface for cluster-level HT detection and labeling. Developed through months of participatory design with domain experts, TrafficVis provides coordinated views in conjunction with carefully chosen backend algorithms to effectively show spatio-temporal and text patterns to a wide variety of anti-HT stakeholders. We build upon state-of-the-art text clustering algorithms by incorporating shared metadata as a signal of connected and possibly suspicious activity, then visualize the results. Domain experts can use TrafficVis to label clusters as HT, or other, suspicious, but non-HT activity such as spam and scam, quickly creating labeled datasets to enable further HT research. Through domain expert feedback and a usage scenario, we demonstrate TRAFFICVIS's efficacy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with repeated high praises for the usability and explainability of our tool, the latter being vital for indicting possible criminals.},

  pages={44-49},
  abstract={Gamification has been widely touted as a useful approach in motivating learners to learn subjects that are perceived as challenging, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This paper reports the process of considering various cultural and social factors in the design of educational games using game design thinking approach. Educational games for STEM subjects were designed and developed through an iteration process that considered the contextual significance of learners' diverse cultural backgrounds. Online and traditional games were used as sources of inspiration, and they were re-designed to fit with learner's interests and context. The findings from 42 learners who played the role as the game designers showed significant impact of the empathy stage in the design loop where cultural elements were shared and integrated into the design. The participatory design approach proves to be very useful in encouraging learners to provide their ideas. Some learners who had limited exposure to computer or video games were still able to combine suitable game mechanics and draw ideas from their surroundings to create their own games. The findings also reveal differing viewpoints of urban and rural learners with regards to use of games of learning. The outcomes from this study provided valuable insights in the formulation of a framework for game design that takes into account learners' diversity.},

  abstract={Inspired by data comics, this paper introduces a novel format for reporting controlled studies in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI). While many studies in HCI follow similar steps in explaining hypotheses, laying out a study design, and reporting results, many of these decisions are buried in blocks of dense scientific text. We propose leveraging data comics as study reports to provide an open and glanceable view of studies by tightly integrating text and images, illustrating design decisions and key insights visually, resulting in visual narratives that can be compelling to non-scientists and researchers alike. Use cases of data comics study reports range from illustrations for non-scientific audiences to graphical abstracts, study summaries, technical talks, textbooks, teaching, blogs, supplementary submission material, and inclusion in scientific articles. This paper provides examples of data comics study reports alongside a graphical repertoire of examples, embedded in a framework of guidelines for creating comics reports which was iterated upon and evaluated through a series of collaborative design sessions.},

  title={Design of PI Controller for a Class of Discrete Cascade Control Systems}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={4},
  pages={2607-2615},
  abstract={This paper mainly studies the modeling, stability analysis and proportional-integral (PI) controller design for a class of discrete-time cascade control systems (CCSs). In the existing CCSs for solving gain of the controller, the controller mostly adopts the proportional (P) controller, but the most commonly used controller in industrial production is PI controller. Based on the actual demand in industry and in order to obtain a better control effect, the design problem of primary and secondary controllers in a class of discrete cascade control is considered, in which the primary controller adopts a PI controller and the secondary controller adopts a P controller. On this basis, the model of cascade control system (CCS) is established. Then, we can create a new Lyapunov functional, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the system is given. Then, the collaborative design method of primary PI controller and secondary P controller is given by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, a simulation example of a main steam temperature with CCS structure is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The PI controller is better than the existing P controller, this method has not only the rapidity of P control, but also the ability of integral control to eliminate steady-state errors. Note to Practitioners—The inspiration of this paper comes from the adjustment of plant controller parameters. The PI controller is the most widely used controller in the existing industrial production, but the adjustment of proportional and integral parameters of the controller is a very troublesome thing. In order to obtain a better controller parameters, a professional engineer may spend a whole day to adjust the parameters. This paper can design the solution of the primary and secondary controller parameters to stabilize the CCS at the same time by LMI technique, which can greatly reduce the work of adjusting the controller parameters. Through simulation, we can know that this method can make the system stable, which shows this method is feasible.},

There is a definite need for many persons to design their space along with an expert and to preview it in order to test its functionality. Many times there is a need for the inhabitants and workers to collaborate in order to co-design their space from distance. Multi-user 3D virtual environments are a powerful form of collaborative telecommunication applications, enabling the users to share a common three dimensional space and interact with each other as well as with the environment surrounding them, in order to collaboratively solve problems or aid learning processes.

Characterized by profit, people, and planet, the supply chain processes of creating values and managing risks are expected to be digitally transformed. Once digitized, datafied, and networked, supply chains can account for substantial progress towards sustainability. Given the lack of clarity on the concepts of resilience and human rights for the supply chain, especially with the recent advancement of social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, the study conducts a scoping review. To identify the size, scope, and themes, it collected 180 articles from the Web of Science bibliographic database. The bibliometric findings reveal the overall conceptual and intellectual structure, and the gaps for further research and development. The concept of resilience can be enriched, for instance, by the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. The enriched notion of resilience can also be expressed in digitized, datafied, and networked forms.},
