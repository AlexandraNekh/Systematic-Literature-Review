  abstract={The paper considers the possibility of using the results of an automated analysis of the communicative practices of city residents in geoinformation social networks, as well as the results of a subjective assessment of the quality of life in the districts of St. Petersburg for the improvement and landscaping of urban areas. The most significant infrastructure facilities that the city residents lack were described, and a subjective assessment of the availability of green spaces in different districts of St. Petersburg was described. Significant correlations of subjective assessments of residents, objective indicators of landscaping and data from their geoinformation social networks were revealed, which allowed to substantiate the objectivity of using information content for the analysis of real ecological infrastructure. The article also describes a data collection model of their geoinformation services, which will be used in the future to specify the problems and resources of various ecological zones of the city.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={74898-74913},
  abstract={The use of serious games for the treatment of people with autism is currently considered a promising approach due to its positive effects on promoting learning through playful and motivating experiences. In recent years, increased research has focused on serious games utilizing Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) technologies, such as large-scale projection-based systems and head-mounted displays. The high level of immersion provided by IVR has been found to benefit learning outcomes, as it reduces environmental distractions and helps individuals focus on learning tasks while also addressing social anxiety. Researchers have conducted significant work in this field over the past decade, yielding promising results. However, the development of these learning interventions comes with methodological challenges and issues, especially in how to conduct the development process and design IVR-based serious games for the learning of people with autism. Based on these premises, this systematic review thoroughly analyzes the literature on developing IVR-based serious games for individuals with autism, discussing inherent shortcomings and reflecting on them. Then, twenty IVR-based serious games for people with autism developed between 2009 and mid-2021 are selected and analyzed, focusing on the people engaged in the development process, the design methodology adopted, and the serious game design framework employed. From this analysis, a set of recommendations are proposed to support anyone interested in developing IVR-based serious games for people with autism. In addition, the gaps left unsolved in the autism literature are highlighted, upon which a research agenda is grounded.},

  abstract={This report is the result of work within the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Extended Reality (XR), a multidiscipline group of industry practitioners, ethicists, academics, researchers, educators, and technology enthusiasts. It has been written to focus on a wide range of ethical issues related to XR and the erosion of anonymity and privacy. This report builds on work outlined in the “Extended Reality” chapter of the IEEE’s seminal ethics-focused publication, Ethically Aligned Design. XR is a term used to broadly refer to a suite of immersive technologies including virtual reality, augmented reality, and spatial computing. The scope of this report is the exploration of ethics-related issues in terms of anonymity and privacy of XR applications; the aim is to initiate expert-driven, multidiscipline analysis of the evolving XR Ethics requirements, with a vision to propose solutions, technologies, and standards in future updates. The set of recommendations within this report will hopefully contribute to industry conceptualization of socio-technological issues, highlight concreted recommendations, and lay the groundwork for future technical-standardization activities.},

  abstract={Background: More and more multinational corporations (MNCs) based in East Asia are adopting international social media to communicate messages on corporate social responsibility (CSR), but little research has investigated their content qualitatively. Literature review: I reviewed the literature related to the convergence and divergence of corporate behaviors under the framework of the institutional theory. Comparative studies on web-based CSR communication (CSRC) were also addressed, and CSR development in China and Korea was described as the research context to develop hypotheses and research questions. Research questions: 1. How do Chinese and Korean CSRCs resemble each other in international social media? 2. What are the differences between Chinese and Korean CSRCs in international social media? Research methodology: I selected six Chinese companies and six Korean firms from the 2019 Forbes 2000 world's-largest-corporations ranking, and analyzed the content of their English-language Facebook accounts using “Leximancer,” a powerful textual analysis software package. Results: Results indicated that the CSR messages of Chinese and Korean firms resembled each other at a macrolevel but differed at a microlevel. In addition, the CSR messages of Chinese companies were more likely to reflect national strategic agendas, while Korean firms placed greater emphasis on short-term events and legal compliance. Conclusions: Chinese and Korean corporations have adopted an approach of “global topics, native framing” in their CSRCs to achieve a balance between internal and external legitimacy.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Alaska's Kenai fisheries are managed for maximum efficiency while ensuring fair allocation across multiple stakeholder groups and long term sustainability of the fishery. Managers must work to meet the fishery's goals while adapting their commercial and subsistence eco-service management practices to meet changing ecological conditions. Pre- and in-season fishery management practices are supported by historical and location-based management knowledge. Unexpected changes to environmental conditions may be outside the adaptive capacity of the management. Furthermore, managers currently lack a tool to test how proposed policy will alter fishery outcomes. We present an agent-based simulation framework designed for the Kenai case-study that incorporates stakeholder harvest and effort data, as well as Oncorhynchus nerka and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmon run-timing dynamics for the last 35 years. The resulting high-fidelity and verified model was used for scenario-based studies to understand how shifting ecological and social drivers effect the seasonal outcomes of fishery dynamics. Scenarios were determined from plausible future changes to system drivers identified during participatory stakeholder meetings and in scientific literature from southeast Alaska. Using our model, we uncovered recent instability in the Kenai fisheries coupled socio-ecological system dynamics, and determined equations that describe the strategy of fishery managers in responding to in-season drivers. Sensitivity of seasonal fishery outcomes to different drivers was quantified via the scenario-based studies. Our results show our agent-based simulation framework to be a capable decision support tool, one that resource managers might use for testing outcomes of proposed policy change in response to environmental change.},

  year={2018},
  volume={6},

  pages={179-202},
  abstract={Information and communication technology (ICT) standards play a crucial role towards harnessing technological developments and shaping the technology landscape. ICT standards development is largely driven by standards developing organizations or standards setting organizations that represent and are informed by the perspectives and interests of the ICT private sector and the public sector. Thus the shaping of the standards is mostly driven by the business, technical, and legal impetus, towards facilitating greater market influence, coordination, integration, interoperability, and legal conformity. The technocentric, business-focused perspective to ICT developments, and corollary to ICT standards development, is distinct from and can be orthogonal to the human-centric perspective that elevates the role and centrality of the human concerns over the technology and business concerns. Notwithstanding the crucial role of business and technology, it remains that at the centre of the 21st century data-driven societies are individuals and end-users who are the primary actants and agents within the technology and data ecosystems. This gives motivation for infusing the human perspectives and values into technology development as well as into ICT standards development. This is more pronounced for cases where the business and technocentric interests are at odds and opposed to the human interests, such as, the need for increased datafication to support Big Data developments versus the need for individuals' privacy preservation. In this research, which is framed through a case study of personal health informatics in the context of sustainable development (i.e., sustainable development goal on “health and wellbeing” – SDG3) indicators monitoring, we have undertaken a survey to investigate the human-centric values and attitudes associated with the collection and use of personal data. From this inquiry, the paper highlights and surfaces: individuals attitudes and perceptions around monitoring of social indicators; key considerations associated with data ownership, privacy and confidentiality of data, as well as sharing of personal data within the data ecosystem. The paper then discusses how these findings could inform and be infused into the development of technology artefacts and standards, towards a realization of more human-centric data-informed societies.},

  abstract={With the development of the times, interior decoration has become a very beloved thing for people. Exquisite interior decoration can make people's mood more joyful. Therefore, researching better design of interior decoration materials is the focus of people's research. However, there are still some problems with interior decoration nowadays, and there is still a slight lack of design accuracy. Therefore, this article studied the design and process analysis of interior decoration materials based on the GA-GRNN (Genetic Algorithm generalized regression neural network) evaluation model. This article tested the accuracy of the GA-GRNN evaluation model for indoor decoration material design through experiments, and found that the maximum error of accuracy was 0.42m, and the minimum error was 0m. From this experimental data, it can be seen that the GA-GRNN evaluation model can play a good role in the design of interior decoration materials.},

While it is true that AR and VR technologies brings tremendous growth and potential, these technologies face a wide range of challenges. The most common challenges and issues among the AR/VR applications as observed in this study are the privacy and security concerns of users where personal and sensitive information can be gathered and collected and are vulnerable to unauthorized intrusion. Affordability, latency, health concerns, perceived usability challenges, and ethical issues are among the other issues that are being addressed in recent research to improve adoption of these technologies. Most of the identified concerns lies upon the responsibility of manufacturers and industry actors, but policymakers should maintain balance and promulgate regulations to allow for the growth and adoption of these technologies. This study highlights several policy recommendations for the technology adoption of augmented and virtual reality.},

  abstract={The prevalence of Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) in northern Madagascar reaches 75 % and often lead to genital pain, contact bleeding, vaginal discharge, irregular menstruation, avoidance of sexual intercourse, and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, due to insufficient access to health care despite being free of charge, and lack of medical expertise on FGS, FGS remains undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. In this paper, we present AINA, an AI-based application for supporting medical professionals in the diagnosis of FGS. The AINA application is developed in a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach. The HCD approach includes an analysis phase in which the target groups, use cases, and environment are considered when eliciting requirements. Subsequently, a final prototype of the AINA application is developed in an iterative design and evaluation process using non-participatory and participatory methods. The design study acts as preliminary work for developing a medical device for use in the rural regions of Africa, i.e., Madagascar.},

  abstract={Semantic extraction is essential for semantic interoperability in multi-enterprise business collaboration environments. Although many studies on semantic extraction have been carried out, few have focused on how to precisely and effectively extract semantics from multiple heterogeneous data schemas. This paper presents a semi-automatic semantic extraction method based on a neutral representation format (NRF) for acquiring semantics from heterogeneous data schemas. As a unified syntax-independent model, NRF removes all the contingencies of heterogeneous data schemas from the original data environment. Conceptual extraction and keyword extraction are used to acquire the semantics from the NRF. Conceptual extraction entails constructing a conceptual model, while keyword extraction seeks to obtain the metadata. An industrial case is given to validate the approach. This method has good extensibility and flexibility. The results show that the method provides simple, accurate, and effective semantic interoperability in multi-enterprise business collaboration environments.},

  abstract={The interaction of society is transforming towards connectivity and digital experiences. This results in big data which cannot be utilized and managed by companies in an efficient way. Despite various applications of the cloud and other advanced technologies, companies cannot distinguish essential information adequately. Consequently, there is a need for data modernization, but there are only partial modernization solutions and no incorporative model. Thus, a literature review was leveraged to isolate 15 related criteria, which are then grouped under 3 main dimensions (i) business, (ii) organizational and cultural, and (iii) technical, which then delivers a generic model suitable to guide and measure the transformation of companies.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the concept of a robot service that interacts with a human operator through speech. Service-oriented architectures and cloud computing are now the dominant computer paradigms. Research on using robots as a service (Robot-as-a-Service. RaaS) is a new trend based on the integration of robots and embedded devices and web and cloud computing. However, while the demand for RaaS utilization within the industry is high, it has not successfully acquired many users. One of the reasons is that the accuracy of the robot's recognition-judgment-action process does not reach a level that users can trust, and the other reason is that it is challenging to learn how to control the robot. Therefore, this study focused on services that allow users to control robots easily within industrial sites. Speech recognition was implemented using RESTful API and Server-Client communication, and a mobile manipulator robot, what we call Little-Helper (LH), is used for implementation. According to the human operators, communicate with the robot by voice speech, increasing collaboration efficiency and productivity of the industry is expected.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={157-168},
  abstract={Designing systems that account for sustainability concerns demands for a better understanding of the impact that digital technology interventions can have on a certain socio-technical context. However, limited studies are available about the elicitation of impact-related information from stakeholders, and strategies are particularly needed to elicit possible longterm effects, including negative ones, that go beyond the planned system goals. This paper reports a case study about the impact of digitalisation in remote mountain areas, in the context of a system for ordinary land management and hydro-geological risk control. The elicitation process was based on interviews and workshops. In the initial phase, past and present impacts were identified. In a second phase, future impacts were forecasted through the discussion of two alternative scenarios: a dystopic, technology-intensive one, and a technology-balanced one. The approach was particularly effective in identifying negative impacts. Among them, we highlight the higher stress due to the excess of connectivity, the partial reduction of decision-making abilities, and the risk of marginalisation for certain types of stakeholders. The study posits that before the elicitation of system goals, requirements engineers need to identify the socio-economic impacts of ICT technologies included in the system, as negative effects need to be properly mitigated. Our study contributes to the literature with: a set of impacts specific to the case, which can apply to similar contexts; an effective approach for impact elicitation; and a list of lessons learned from the experience.},

  abstract={As the Web is used increasingly to share and disseminate information, business analysts and managers are challenged to understand stakeholder relationships. Traditional stakeholder analysis approaches fail to accommodate the rapid Web growth while existing business intelligence tools lack analysis capability. This paper proposes an automatic classification approach to business stakeholder analysis on the Web. Based on the approach, we developed a system called Business Stakeholder Analyzer to perform automatic classification of stakeholder types. Experimental results showed that, compared with humans, the system achieved better within-class accuracies in widespread stakeholder types such as "partner/sponsor/supplier" and "media/reviewer." It was more efficient than human classification. The encouraging findings suggest a promising future of our approach to facilitating knowledge sharing in collaborative commerce.},

  abstract={Construction projects exert a profound and lasting influence on the natural environment. Over the complete lifespan of buildings within the context of smart cities, there exists a dynamic interplay between these structures and the environment. This complexity introduces challenges in decision-making regarding the choice of the most optimal materials and technological solutions, leading to specific implications in subsequent phases of the project. This study adopts an analytical approach, aiming to investigate practical management issues pertaining to the construction, operation, and deconstruction of selected building types. It embraces the principles of the circular economy, aligning this construction model with the overarching concept of smart cities. The document elaborates on the concept of sustainable development, delving into the roles played by various stakeholders in the construction industry towards achieving sustainable development objectives, while also discussing associated costs, benefits, and barriers. Moreover, the text expounds on the principles underpinning the circular economy within the context of smart cities and offers a comprehensive analysis of the shift from a linear construction model to a circular one within the construction sector. Additionally, the document presents findings from an empirical study conducted to gauge the perception of sustainable construction within the Polish market, along with a presentation of its outcomes.},

The dynamic evaluation of the design process is obviously conducive to the optimization of man-machine efficiency. A system design method based on mix reality is proposed, and the system design and method verification are carried out with a large-type passenger plane as the target model. The proposed method focuses on solving the dynamic matching problem of virtual and physical scenes in human in the loop, and realizes the coordinated matching between rigid simulation and flexible human body. At the same time, the problem of dynamic access of general multi-source simulation data is solved, and the coordinated dynamic visualization between numerical data and image data is realized.

  abstract={Aging is a global phenomenon affecting the sustainability of national welfare systems. Care technologies are expected to improve the seniors' quality of life, remove the burden of the care personnel, and, consequently, enhance the welfare systems' sustainability. The effective technological development and integration of care technology has been actively studied and discussed, focusing especially on user involvement. However, few empirical studies have been performed on the required actions of the care technology developers for technology integration. Therefore, we conducted a multiple case study of the care technology developers to clarify the required actions for promoting care technology integration in the care service systems. Through semistructured interviews of six business cases in Japan and a qualitative thematic analysis of the individual ones, we obtained nine required actions for care technology integration that were categorized according to their major stakeholders and business phases. In addition, we carried out a cross-case analysis from the aspects of business types, firm sizes, and product types to examine the differences in the required actions. This article contributes to extending the research focus on care technology development and integration to its dissemination phase and the corresponding actions to offer an effective guidance for the care technology developers.},

  abstract={In this paper, we report on a series of design innovation projects conducted by student teams at the University of Colorado at Denver in collaboration with research scientists at the US Air Force Research Lab. The COVID-19 pandemic has made apparent the risks of disease transmission through multiple vectors in public spaces that could potentially benefit from further protection and safety measures. Utilizing formal ideation and innovation methods from the 4D Design Innovation (DI) process, the teams studied what specific problems to solve, explored potential solution ideas, and developed some early-concept prototypes for feasibility demonstration. Design Innovation (DI) provides both an overall process for product design and also methods for each step in the process. This paper details the correlation between the steps in the DI process and the results produced by the teams. The teams primarily focused on minimizing the risk of disease transmission through reducing the physical touching of common public items; additional solutions relating to contact tracing and social distancing were also explored. Initial functional prototypes were developed and demonstrated for: (a) touchless elevator control systems using voice commands, foot pedals, gestures, and touchless buttons; (b) an automated desk usage hygienic management system; (c) an automated remote video person tracker for monitoring compliance with indoor social distancing and room capacity limits; and (d) a contact tracing app. We discuss the prototyped solutions in detail, and describe promising ways forward for developing these technologies, with the aims of combatting the spread of disease and ensuring overall public health, safety, and security.},

  abstract={Smart learning environments (SLEs) leverage technological developments to enable effective, engaging, and personalized learning. SLEs rely on sensor and advanced interconnectivity capabilities to infer and reason. A natural set of affordances for SLEs are those of multisensory environments (MSEs). MSEs enable humans to make full use of their senses and equip learning systems with new information, methods of information exchange, and intelligent capabilities. In addition to novel forms of interaction, MSEs also offer novel forms of “learner traces” through multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). This article presents the results of a systematic literature review on how multisensory interactions and the respective analytics can support the use and design of SLEs. The findings from the analysis of 33 papers synthesize and clarify the latest advancements in the intersection of interactions and analytics in MSEs, discuss how those advancements can support SLEs' affordances and uses, and pave the way for improving our understanding of how various interaction modalities can support learning and under what conditions.},

  abstract={Automated Teller Machines (ATM) are critical to banking operations due to their convenient and widespread use. Apart from queues reduced in banking halls, bank clients can still access services outside the regular operational hours. However, a rise in ATM fraud cases has led to banks improving ATM security by adding security ATM keypad covers, surveillance cameras, and even ATM security booths, measures that were not there at ATMs' inception. The academia is also replete with literature on various ATM designs to enhance the security of the facility and the user. However, proposed solutions rarely build on existing infrastructure and technologies, making them difficult to implement as they require additional equipment. For IoT-based solutions, testing is relegated to the communication of components without evaluating the practicability of the proposed solution. In an effort to correct these challenges and secure an ATM user, this paper introduces a conceptual design of a secure cardless ATM system that leverages existing technologies and infrastructure with little additional costs for implementation. A workshop was then used to identify improvements for future implementation. Recommendations from stakeholders and lessons learned from the workshop are discussed.},

This paper will summarise existing research and key concepts in the delivery of Societal Value, applying examples from both existing and planned radio astronomy projects such as the Very Large Array (VLA, USA) and Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA, USA), Square Kilometre Array (SKA, South Africa and Australia), Arecibo (NAIC, Puerto Rico), Ghana Radio Telescope Observatory, and Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA, Chile). Such projects are built in rural areas, bringing services, infrastructure, jobs, education, and astrotourism to surrounding communities. Answering these research questions can lead to the development of a societal value framework for construction projects, including metrics and an audit methodology, for use by organisations and governments in practising project assurance.},

  abstract={Citizen engagement in Citizen Science (CS) means an active involvement of individual citizens in scientific research, policy and program development. However, it should be noted that including stakeholders in CS organisation, planning, decision-making, implementation of activities and evaluation requires adequate technological capacity, the understanding of roles and clear communication. The possibility to engage users in data science together with the power of AI algorithms presents no doubt opportunities for crowd sourced data science and collective intelligence to be brought to bear on fundamental challenges facing humanity like poverty, diseases, famines and developmental challenges. The focus of the interdisciplinary multinational consortium CLIMAS (Horizon Europe project) is research on empowerment of citizen scientist, researchers, civil organizations, SMEs, innovators, and policy makers by offering practical insights for co-creation of collective intelligence, aligning values and build trust between stakeholders. The project is based on idea that Climate Assemblies can be a perfect domain for participating in citizen science projects, with an active contribution of citizens by tackling environmental issues. In this sense, citizens participate in the collection of evidence, but also in the co-creation of new knowledge to increase awareness of climate change and ultimately to drive changes in climate policy.},

  abstract={Modern product customization aims at satisfying customers' individual requirements by providing customers various customization approaches. Recently, customers, especially lead users, are proven that they can play an active role in product innovation by using their potential user knowledge and creative skills. However, there is an obvious lack of systematic and deep research on customers' innovation or co-creation in current product customization systems. By customer integration and team collaborative creativity, a conceptual framework for collaborative customer innovation (CCI) is formulated in this paper, which proposes a new customer integrating approach beyond product customization. First, the concept and connotation of CCI are presented by comparing this emergent innovation approach with existing researches. Second, by studying the essential working principle of CCI, technology-driven knowledge spiral collaborative innovation mechanism and an agent-based team working model are formulated and described in detail. To realize customer collaborative innovation, the function structure of the innovation platform of CCI is analyzed and proposed. An innovation platform for household ceramic products is constructed as the application of CCI, and a case study is presented to validate the above principle and working model. The proposed conceptual framework for CCI can be used to build the collaborative customer innovation organization, develop innovation toolkits, and instruct enterprises to realize CCI effectively.},

  pages={112362-112383},
  abstract={The creation of sustainable artificial tropical forests is of utmost importance for addressing critical environmental issues like deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change. This research paper presents an innovative approach that considers ecological, socioeconomic, and technological factors. The proposed approach integrates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that take into account the preferences and opinions of stakeholders. To analyze the various criteria involved, cubic picture fuzzy numbers (CPFNs) are utilized. To ensure fairness in evaluating CPFNs, the study focuses on developing operational laws and aggregation operators that promote neutrality and fairness. Specifically, the paper introduces the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly weighted average (CPFFWA) operator” and the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly ordered weighted averaging (CPFFOWA) operator.” By considering stakeholders and prioritizing their long-term sustainability and resilience, this approach proves to be highly valuable for policymakers, forest managers, and other relevant parties. This research avenue bridges the gap in current literature where limited exploration of fairly aggregation operators in tandem with picture fuzzy sets within tropical forest contexts exists. Ultimately, the research strives to contribute to the practical management of these vital ecosystems, fostering environmental conservation and sustainability through a cross-disciplinary approach amalgamating ecology, fuzzy logic, decision theory, and environmental science.},

  abstract={Demand is growing for markerless augmented reality (AR) experiences, but designers of the real-world spaces that host them still have to rely on inexact, qualitative guidelines on the visual environment to try and facilitate accurate pose tracking. Furthermore, the need for visual texture to support markerless AR is often at odds with human aesthetic preferences, and understanding how to balance these competing requirements is challenging due to the siloed nature of the relevant research areas. To address this, we present an integrated design methodology for AR spaces, that incorporates both tracking and human factors into the design process. On the tracking side, we develop the first VI-SLAM evaluation technique that combines the flexibility and control of virtual environments with real inertial data. We use it to perform systematic, quantitative experiments on the effect of visual texture on pose estimation accuracy; through 2000 trials in 20 environments, we reveal the impact of both texture complexity and edge strength. On the human side, we show how virtual reality (VR) can be used to evaluate user satisfaction with environments, and highlight how this can be tailored to AR research and use cases. Finally, we demonstrate our integrated design methodology with a case study on AR museum design, in which we conduct both VI-SLAM evaluations and a VR-based user study of four different museum environments.},

  abstract={The foundation of a smart and connected community is its advanced digital infrastructure. Kilobits of bandwidth to the home and smart business became available in the 1970s via dial-up. Two decades after that in the 1990s, megabits became available via cable modem. Another two decades introduced gigabit to the home and small business in the 2010s. Gigabit networking to the home and small business has created a gigabit frontier of new applications. Gigabit has changed the game for applications delivered to homes and small businesses in three fundamental ways: increased flow size, reduced response times, and ability to accommodate multiple segregated flows of differential Quality of Experience. Examples of US Ignite gigabit applications and services deployed within the 30 US Ignite Smart Gigabit Communities are discussed. The COVID-19 pandemic adds additional rationale for gigabit networking. Future applications for gigabit applications that may arrive later in the 2020s are discussed. Academics are beginning to experiment with terabit networking which appears to be on-schedule for deployment to homes and small businesses in the 2030s.},

In this paper the author concentrates on housing scenarios which were evaluated by VTT in Finland and by Legrand in France. According to the evaluation results the main challenge with housing systems is co-operation with existing house information systems. The users are not carrying their mobile phones with them at home, so the mobile phone centric system has to be based on the mobile phone connecting to the existing house network. Preventing problems (water leaks, unwanted visitors etc.) is one of the main positive effects that the potential users of a new technology valued. Extensive automation of home system raised fears but also advantages were noticed particularly for certain user groups},

With this regard, patient portals are frequently referenced for enabling patient integration. Existing solutions primarily focus on the access to electronic health records but do not aim for the integration of cross institutional information about the course of treatment itself - known as patient pathway. Thus, this paper proposes a reference architecture for the integration of pathway systems into patient portals. High-level requirements have been captured from both a user's perspective and a theory perspective. Therefore, a large-scale patient survey was conducted within a general design science research approach. They were transformed into appropriate modules and components of a reference architecture. Its applicability is demonstratively shown by the development of a patient portal for Multiple Sclerosis patients.},

  abstract={Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to enhance business processes. Although digital transformation has become significant for the sustainability of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), they are challenged by the barriers to digitalisation due to their limited resources, and the complexity of equivalent commercial solutions. Low-cost digital solutions are often tailored to meet the requirements of SMEs to initiate their digital transformation. However, there is a lack of studies about the cost-effectiveness of acquiring low-cost digital solutions compared to off-the-shelf commercial tools, particularly for SMEs. This study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of low-cost digital solutions for SMEs through a real-world case study performed in a sustainable building components manufacturer and off-site construction SME. We developed a low-cost inventory tracking solution using a so-called `Digital Shoestring' approach, which provides a template for designing digital solutions based on low-cost readily available hardware and software components. The time/effort and cost spent on designing and developing the digital solution were compared with potential off-the-shelf commercial inventory tracking solutions. The results showed that the low-cost inventory tracking solution facilitated the digital transformation of the construction SME in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the inventory tracking solution was tailored based on the user requirements of the SME, thereby making it more suitable for their day-to-day operations.},

  abstract={The vision of the Internet of Production (loP) is focused on optimizing manufacturing processes, with the help of Industry 4.0 technologies (14Ts). However, considering global megatrends such as climate change and the need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is a growing imperative for the manufacturing industry to become more sustainable. This opens the door to transforming the IoP into an Internet of Sustainable Production (loSP). Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel four-step loSP-framework that establishes an Information System (IS) allowing researchers and practitioners to acknowledge and adapt to the interconnected nature of sustainability. Further, to test its applicability, an inter- and cross-disciplinary perspective is adopted to illustrate case-related challenges, opportunities, and pathways - revealed by the proposed framework - in the example of a digital economy for sustainability data, strategic design of global production networks, human-robot collaboration, digital photonic production, and the textile industry. Together, the framework demonstrates the usefulness of generating holistic information on the interconnected nature of sustainability derived from process-specific and contextualized data, while simultaneously assessing the framework's utilization for sustainability, as well as the sustainability of its use.},

  abstract={Companies have been increasingly opting to utilize project teams to contend with highly turbulent and dynamic conditions while under current uncertainty markets, stakeholders have tremendous influences on the performance of R&D projects. For example, as a key internal stakeholder, the top manager’s decisions including budget, personnel et al. could be vital for a R&D project team. The different interests among different internal and external stakeholders’ make the problem more complex. In this paper, we utilize the neural network algorithm to simulate the decisions from the top manager. With the data from non-industrial robotic R&D project teams in Japan, a neural network model of the top manager is constructed. Afterwards we design role-play card games to reconstruct the R&D processes of project teams. Two types of card, stakeholder card and technology card, are randomly allocated to the participants. Participants then decide their R&D strategies and the strategies are evaluated by the neural network model.

  abstract={Many organizations still face challenges leveraging data science in production and need strategic planning for organization-wide data science efforts and assets. Data Science Roadmapping (DSR) customizes the widely used Technology Roadmapping to facilitate such planning in organizations, aligning market, business, data, technology, and organization perspectives. This paper employs the action research method to customize and apply DSR in an oil and gas company. The approach mostly met the expectations regarding objectives and outcomes, the first step toward generalizability. The case study provides researchers and practitioners insights into roadmapping customization, remote and agile roadmap development process, and strategic planning for technology adoption in a large organization. Lastly, we identify the future research directions using the recent roadmapping literature.},

  abstract={Cancer prevalence, particularly among older individuals, imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems. However, care for older cancer patients is often insufficient and fails to address their specific needs. The LifeChamps H2020 EU project aims to develop a patient-centered digital platform to improve monitoring, anticipation, and support for complications that can deteriorate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older cancer survivors. By facilitating comprehensive clinical assessments and new integrated care models, it addresses the challenges and gaps in clinical practice, promoting patient-centered care through remote digital monitoring tools that collect HRQoL data not typically captured in routine clinical practice.},

  abstract={The large increase in computer network usage, and the huge amount of sensitive data being stored and transferred through them, has escalated the attacks and invasions on these networks. Intrusion detection systems help in detecting these attacks, but the large amount of false positives has decreased their usability. Different methods have been proposed to reduce the amount of these false positives, which consist of different classification methods. Aggregation of similar alerts is a method proposed to reduce false positives and the large number of alerts, but the problem is assigning similar alerts the same classification parameters. Rules have been created which correlate alerts based on three parameters, but the alerts should be labeled with these parameters. Labeling these alerts, is a time consuming task, because deep knowledge on each alert is required to correctly identify the parameters. This time consuming job has been done on 13000 Emerging Threats Snort signatures, and has been used as a knowledge base to label other alerts. In this paper a method has been proposed to label similar signatures automatically. This method uses word extraction from signatures to identify the words which can specify these labels automatically. To test the method around 1000 signatures, which have been classified manually, were classified by this method and the precision and recall has been computed. The results show that a large number of signatures can be classified using this method.},

  abstract={This research introduces the interactive process design of an Ice Breaking Stage. The Ice Breaking Stage serves as the starting point for participants in cross-disciplinary teams to engage in an Empathy game. The purpose of this stage is to allow team members from different disciplines to understand each other's personality traits. Thoughts, and perspectives through interactive activities and collaborative tasks. Based on the literature review, a conceptualized interactive process can be designed using visualizations, problem prompts, role-playing, and scenario simulations. The steps involved in the Ice Breaking Stage design include role review, initial sharing, system assistance, sharing created scenarios, simulating role-playing, and sharing solutions. All are aimed at guiding participants into a simulated role-playing scenario. Through user testing and preliminary research analysis, this study explores the digital-assisted interactive design method of the Ice Breaking Stage, focusing on sustainable development. The method utilizes genetic algorithms to generate virtual creatures with different body parts, enhancing knowledge sharing and the introductory process among team members. The research outcomes include the generation of virtual dynamic creatures using square and spherical shapes, with observed smooth dynamic operations. However, the combination of square-shaped creatures showed inconsistency, occasional movement pauses, and collision issues. On the other hand, the combination of spherical creatures visually presented smoother results. Additionally, user interface and derivative designs to generate virtual dynamic creatures can assist users in creating different contextual combinations. This approach is feasible. Future directions for exploration may include considering selection patterns and expanding the combination models of creatures and body parts. Adjusting variations in geometric shapes, size controls, and interface visual displays.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={352-357},
  abstract={In response to globalization and increased competition, individual professionals in a single field often cannot provide comprehensive solutions. Collaboration among professionals from different disciplines is required to find more effective solutions. This study aims to develop a system called AIGC (AI Generated Content) to facilitate idea convergence in interdisciplinary teams. The system aims to address the collaboration challenges between engineering and design fields and facilitate consensus through the introduction of images and visual elements. To achieve this goal, qualitative research methods were employed, including contextual interviews, the KJ method, brainstorming, personas, and user journey mapping, among others. These methods were chosen because they provide in-depth understanding of communication and collaboration patterns among participants and offer valuable insights. The selection of participants was based on their experience and expertise in interdisciplinary projects. Students from design and engineering fields were chosen as research participants to ensure diversity and representativeness. During the execution of the study, the research team collected data through contextual interviews and related qualitative research methods. The steps involved in contextual interviews included selecting appropriate scenarios, designing relevant guided questions, and conducting face-to-face interviews. Through these methods, we gained deep insights into participants' communication patterns, thought processes, and collaboration needs. The results of this study demonstrate that the AIGC system, which facilitates interdisciplinary idea convergence, effectively promotes consensus among participants. This is achieved through interactive processes such as selecting images, describing images, and engaging in interactive design. The application of the system is significant in addressing collaboration challenges between the engineering and design fields and holds potential value in enhancing teamwork and creative output.},

  abstract={Currently, risk assessment is more of an art than a science. In this paper, we demonstrate how a previously proposed theoretical risk assessment framework that focuses on making risk assessment more scientific can be implemented and applied to cloud networks. Our work offers a practical risk assessment implementation for cloud networks where disparate network owners can directly measure network risks in an objective, uniform and repeatable manner across networks by allowing the network owners to collaboratively agree on risk metrics and continuously monitor their cloud networks with the same tool, which employs these agreed upon metrics. The end result is a science-based risk metric (SBRM) based on the global impact of the vulnerabilities in the network. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this SBRM by: (1) imposing real vulnerabilities on realistic cloud networks built from real hardware (multi-core 3 Ghz Xeon Deterlab servers), (2) demonstrating the operational use of our risk assessment implementation to measure risk across several emulated cloud networks, and (3) describing our approach.},

  abstract={Figures within biomedical articles present essential evidence of the relevance of a publication in a curation workflow. In particular, visual cues of the image modality or experimental methods can help expert curators identify relevant papers from an increasing number of publications. Automating the identification of these content-bearing images can thus be helpful in computer-assisted curation. However, the paucity of labeled datasets and the specialized training required to label such images hinder the development of such tools. To address this problem, we present the design of ANIMO, a labeling system that integrates extraction and segmentation tools to ease the annotation burden. We first introduce two taxonomies of image modalities and experimental methods, derived in collaboration with curators. On the back-end of the system, we process batches of documents and create a labeling task per document. At the front-end, expert curators can access these tasks through a web interface and access the article of interest. We describe the evaluation of this system by a group of biocurators, and the human factor lessons learned from this interdisciplinary experience.},

RE activities are central to software development and its success. Advances in automation have been explored in requirements engineering activities and processes in the industry. However, the application of automated support is still limited in practice. In this study, we examine automated RE support in agile development through a qualitative analysis using industry experts. We have found that the application of automated RE support tools is primarily in the experimental stage, largely due to the limited practical implementation in industry settings. The current focus has been on research experiments, with relatively fewer instances of real-world industry application. Although experts are optimistic about its huge potential to reduce development efforts and costs if automation is harnessed. Therefore, we anticipate that these findings will be beneficial for practitioners responsible for developing RE tools for agile development, as well as for the researchers.},

However, AAC devices do not support nonverbal communication, which allows people to take turns, regulate conversation dynamics, and express intentions. Nonverbal communication requires motion, which is often challenging for AAC users to produce due to motor constraints. In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as “sidekicks,” might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers’ goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing. We show how these parameters manifest in appearance and behavior and how they can guide future designs for augmented nonverbal communication.},

In recent times, social media has emerged as a compelling communication platform with its remarkable contribution to providing a haven for its users to express their freedom of speech. However, academic literature still lacks empirical research that show how companies in India are performing through social media communication. Among all the available social media platforms, Twitter is popular globally and most dominant for communication and impact. Also, since Twitter is widely used by all layers of society, from the most influential people and the most powerful organizations to the common person, and the tweets contain massive data. In this paper, the authors have used sentiment analysis for evaluating the communication of the Indian companies of Indian. The study is based on a sample of 9,000 plus Tweets during a month. Using the cloud based and sentiment analysis the authors have analyzed the communication of these companies.},

  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) providing an environment to connect all the things from the world to internet. It interconnects smart things and provides advanced building management systems, smart city services, participatory sensing applications which improve every day's life. IoT hold wide range of physical objects embedded with tags, sensors, devices that had not been involved with internet and allow them to interact to provide IoT applications. The adoption of IoT is ubiquitous but it also arises the major concerns about “Privacy”. Privacy includes the secretion of personal information as well as therapy of data. This paper accommodates systematic literature review of privacy threats and challenges along with the techniques used to deal and address them which emerged in the research literature. I observed that very rare models consented to eliminate privacy aspects. I also analyzed that the focus of the multiple solution providers was user-centric point of view. Not one of the existing surveys analyze the privacy of IoT in terms of organized analysis of the privacy fundamentals and approaches. There is need to work on it.},

  abstract={Systems often inspire the development of new models to manage size and complexity challenges in system development. Engineers should be aware of overlap in the models used for systems engineering of systems as it would be inefficient to reiterate overlapping tasks. The objective of this article is to identify consistencies between two models that appear to have overlapping tasks: Goal-Function Trees (GFTs) and value models. Both models are perceived to represent information about the system and stakeholder preferences, but have historically used differing processes and language. An analysis of the functional use and terminology for the two models reveals consistencies. The two models are compared in this article using content analysis of systems engineering academic literature. It is seen that physics-based system representation and stakeholder preference incorporation are often common to both models. A coffee maker is used to illustrate the potential consistencies and overlapping tasks between the models. Extending this simple example, the applicability of the models to space systems is discussed. The findings of this article can be used by systems engineers to improve their efficiency when applying both GFTs and value models.},

This International Standard provides a common vocabulary applicable to all systems and software engineering work falling within the scope of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, Systems and software engineering, and the IEEE Computer Society Systems and Software Engineering Standards Committee (IEEE-CS S2ESC).The scope of each concept defined has been chosen to provide a definition that is suitable for general application. In those circumstances where a restricted application is concerned, a more specific definition might be needed.Terms have been excluded if they were considered to be parochial to one group or organization; company proprietary or trademarked; multi-word terms whose meaning could be inferred from the definitions of the component words; terms whose meaning in the information technology (IT) field could be directly inferred from their common English dictionary meaning.},

  abstract={Mobile eHealth applications have become very popular, not just using mobile phones but also wearables, mobile AR/VR, and increasingly "smart houses" and "smart care" sensing and interaction facilities. However, a large majority of these solutions, despite early promise, suffer from a range of challenges including effort to develop, deploy and maintain; lack of end-user acceptance; integration with other health systems; diffculty in tailoring to divergent users; lack of adequate feedback to developers; lack of sustainable adoption; and ultimately lack of success. In this MobileSoft vision paper, we characterise these key issues from a Software Engineering perspective and present and discuss some approaches to mitigating them, building on our and others prior work.},

  abstract={Evidences across industries including telecommunication, retail and trading, suggests many benefits are to be gained from automation. To obtain these benefits in the field of healthcare, there have been vast amount of studies conducted on utilization of technological capabilities during the past few decades. From medical information systems to Telemedicine to ubiquitous computing, smart and connected health applications are designed to have a positive impact on current and future health care practices. While there have been a lot of successful innovations in these applications, there have also been a lot of failure. Study of these applications highlights the importance of user involvements from the very early stage of new product development. This paper utilizes the categories identified in Smart and Connected Health (SCH) terminology recognized by National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct a holistic study of different technological applications developed for healthcare to identify major barriers inhibiting their diffusion. The User Centered Design (UCD) methodologies proven valuable in industrial contexts are reviewed to highlight their characteristics and capabilities to facilitate user involvement. It references cases where they have been valuable toolkits to address barriers recognized. Finally, the study categorizes the major barriers captured throughout the study and recommends best user centered design(s) approaches to be deployed for superior front-end management of healthcare solution innovation.},

  abstract={Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems have been widely used to support teamwork in various fields such as design, education, research projects, etc. However, there is a great deal of knowledge generated directly or indirectly in the process of collaboration which is not well utilized and usually ignored instead of being reused and shared to help improve work efficiency. To bridge the gap between knowledge generation and utilization through CSCW, in this paper, we propose a knowledge mining based collaborative framework and first apply it to manufacturing value chains to achieve better work efficiency and reduce repetitive work in collaboration. Overall, this paper introduces the following novel insights and innovations: (1) we argue that there is a gap between the generated knowledge and the utilization of it during cooperative work; (2) a novel collaborative framework with knowledge mining approaches is proposed to bridge the gap; (3) a prototype system is further built and first applied to the manufacturing value chains. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to deal with knowledge reusing in CSCW of manufacturing value chains.},
