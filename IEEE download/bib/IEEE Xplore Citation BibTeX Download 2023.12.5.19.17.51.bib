  abstract={Building upon the perspective of integrating knowledge management, ontology engineering and sustainable product technologies, the paper argues that formalization of sustainable design knowledge in ontology and semantic knowledge markup would allow efficient and effective semantic knowledge sharing in sustainable product design. Towards this end, two mechanisms are proposed: for ontology modeling to formalize design knowledge and for ontology implementation in sustainable design systems to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing across multidisciplinary teams and applications. A use scenario is demonstrated in the paper to validate these mechanisms.},

With the help of domain ontology the model is augmented many friendly interactive functions. It is made up of many interactive units. Each of them has consanguineous connections with the domain ontology. Through the relationships of the model and ontology concepts, according to the property connections of each ontology concept, the model achieves the additional functions.

  abstract={The Corona Virus (COVID 19) pandemic is quickly becoming the world's most deadly disease. The spreading rate is higher and the early detection helps in faster recovery. The existence of COVID 19 in individuals shall be detected using molecular analysis or through radiographs of lungs. As time and test kit are limited RT- PCR is not suitable to test all. The RT- PCR being a time-consuming process, diagnosis using chest radiographs needs no transportation as the modern X-ray systems are digitized. Deep learning takes an edge over other techniques as it deduces the features automatically and performs massively parallel computations. Multiple feature maps will help in accurate prediction. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a Computer Aided Deep Learning System identify and localize COVID-19 virus from other viruses and pneumonia. It helps to detect COVID-19 within a short period of time thereby improving the lifetime of the individuals. SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA benchmark datasets are used to examine the proposed system. Recall, Precision, Accuracy-rate, and F-Measure are the metrics used to prove the integrity of the system.},

  abstract={New inventions and changes in technology and methodologies affect design activity frequently resulting in unpredictable effects on the final design solution, hence on the real outcome - unsatisfactory buildings. To avoid these consequences, it is necessary to store and exploit ever-growing knowledge and experiences that allow these problems to be overcome. An innovative `Abstraction Layer' overlying existing application programs has been introduced to model a Reasoner that verifies the coherence of design solutions. This one has been developed by means of an entity class based on ontologies at semantic level, not data. This paper explains how the Reasoner prototype is linked with usual CAAD and BIM tools in order to demonstrate the insight. This research is mainly related with architectural and construction design - but can also be applied to many sectors.},

  abstract={Requirements are a key factor in determining the success or failure of the system development process. Requirements engineering is a creative problem-solving process whose primary purpose is to enable researchers and practitioners to apply appropriate theories, models, techniques and tools to understand and support the requirements processes more effectively. However, there is a multitude of ways to conduct the requirements engineering process and the quality of the requirements can be greatly influenced by the approaches employed. While consensus exists that no one approach works in all situations, how do practitioners and researchers select the most relevant and appropriate approach(es)? In order to understand this, we argue that a community-based effort is required to organise the plethora of requirements engineering approaches into an ontology. Such a structure would provide an opportunity to identify gaps and to improve the interfaces between approaches. Crowdsourcing the development and validation of such an ontology would facilitate its application across different system types and application domains.},

  abstract={The ultimate ambient intelligent care room environment would be able to sense the needs and preferences of the patients and nurses and adapt itself accordingly. This implies an emerging demand for the integration and exploitation of heterogeneous information available from different technologies. Nowadays, the nurse is responsible for orchestrating all these technologies, which slows down the adoption rate. In this paper, a context-aware, ambient aware and pervasive framework is proposed that tackles this integration problem by using an ontology. Rules, defined on top of this ontology, implement algorithms to optimize and automate care tasks. To increase the acceptance of the new technology, a user-driven development process is used which involves the stakeholders in every step of the design of the ontology and algorithms. To make the framework adaptable to future needs, a self-learning component is introduced that detects trends in the execution of the Rules and adapts the system accordingly.},

  abstract={One of the most critical decision points in collaborative product development is final design concept selection. This crucial stage is considered as a complicated multi-criteria decision-making problem which affects not only the subsequent design stages but the whole product lifecycle and supply chain. In fact, in addition to the fact that it is a knowledge intensive based phase, the information manipulated at this stage is mainly subjective and imprecise. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new fuzzy-ontology based approach to handle the vagueness and subjectivity in design concept evaluation and to support the decision making process at this phase. A case study is given to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.},

The ontology is employed to represent the concepts and design instances of the embedded system as well. A knowledge system is developed to configure the software and hardware components of the embedded system.

  abstract={To realize a simultaneous design of a product and its optimized supply chain, effective integration among design collaborators is a must. With the emergence of ontologies as a new modeling paradigm in industry during the last decade, efficient integration and semantic interoperability among all the inter-actors of the extended enterprise have become attainable. In fact, in addition to their great expressiveness, ontologies can afford many reasoning capabilities. In this paper, a reference ontology, general enough to represent both the product and supply chain data and specific enough to support the decision making process in the simultaneous design phase, has been proposed and implemented. In addition, we have exploited its potentialities through the proposition of a new integrating approach based on the dynamic interaction between ontology and mathematical models of optimization, in order to support interoperability and the optimization process within the simultaneous design of the product and its related supply chain.},

Starting with the Ecology of Resources model of learning, we identify "filters" that limit the adoption of new and hybrid learning processes in formal contexts. The related "boundary" issues of the Theory of Learning for the Mobile Age, are then discussed from a Learner-Generated Contexts Research Group perspective. This enables us to demonstrate that the Open Context Model of Learning could provide a framework by which a co-creation model of learning might enable learning processes, which bridge these traditional learning boundaries. We conclude by arguing that by using an Organizational Architecture of Participation we can identify system processes by which institutions can recognize and mainstream hybrid learning processes and in so doing become "adaptive".},

  abstract={Aiming at the problem that the convolutional neural network commonly used in PCB defect detection is difficult to deploy in embedded devices with limited resources, an FPGA embedded system is designed to realize the hardware deployment of YOLOv3 neural network for PCB defect detection. The system is mainly designed from two aspects. The deep learning processing unit DPU is designed on the hardware side to quickly process the convolution calculation part of the neural network and configure the system software for it. At the algorithm side, the model is compressed by using a quantization method to reduce the computational complexity of the model and generate a DPU deployable model. The experimental results show that the designed system can still maintain the accuracy of 0.789 in PCB defect detection. At the same time, the convolution calculation throughput of 2.44TOPS and the detection speed of 97.59ms per frame delay are realized under low power consumption, which is suitable for industrial PCB defect detection.},

First, we present our knowledge acquisition method aimed at the representation of all the knowledge on the reasoning process formalized with the help of the conformity-checking ontology. Based on this method, we then develop a reasoning model on the checking of the conformity of a construction project against technical norms by matching of a representation of a construction project to representations of conformity queries. In order to enrich our model with tacit expert knowledge guiding the checking process, we develop special (semi)formal expert rules based on semantic annotations of conformity queries that schedule the matching operations of the checking process and, thus, make it more effective. Finally, to validate our model, we present the C3R system and discuss its further development to integrate the context knowledge related to non-formalised construction practices.},

  abstract={Researching is a process whereby a large amount of new and unstructured knowledge is created and accumulated. In this context, the capture of complex knowledge about detailed work and decision-making issues throughout a research project is very challenging for modern researchers. Knowledge graph technology can help machines better understand complicated relationships between entities, has great potential for helping researchers with organizing and automating such kinds of repetitive works, and even uncovering and providing new insights into related topics.This paper introduces a way to construct a research management platform by providing a profiling and query system visualized as a knowledge graph. With the scope of this platform being restricted to the research field, typical ontologies are proposed on different levels. For better and more meaningful visualization, specific modifications and improvements to the traditional knowledge graph structure are discussed. A prototype system that is under construction is then described based on the above work, with the extensive applications discussed.},

  abstract={Concern orientation gives us methodological tools for managing the system complexity. Separation of concerns in the aspect oriented software development (AOSD) allows architects to structure and developers to better manage complex systems by mapping the whole system in a multi-concern space and focusing one problem at a time. Certainly, there is a lot of confusion in AOSD about what a concern is. In this context, we defined as more precisely as possible the concern concept in information engineering. From our point of view, a concern is a care of one or more stakeholders involved in the construction or evolution of an information system in its natural environment. In order to make accurate the meaning of the concern concept, in this paper we introduce CONO (CONcerns Ontology), an ontology of the concern concept, which formally describes its meaning as we gave in our definition. Each concern might be described by its high-level specification that is a description formed by the problem specification of the concern and the roles of the stakeholders, which have that concern. The concepts from the high-level specifications constitute the stakeholders' vocabulary and can be used in the construction of an ontology of the new information system.},

  abstract={Through Life Capability Management (TLCM) is a complex evolving domain that requires a new approach to better understand the different viewpoints, models and practices within various enterprises to support a future conceptual model development. This research applied Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to identify the activities necessary to transform an existing aerospace and defence business model to one that would support TLCM. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts and stakeholders across a range of different relevant functions and organisations to identify the activities required to support conceptual model development. A bottom-up approach was used to provide a TLCM ontology and a top-down approach was proposed to develop the root definitions derived from the experts' perception of TLCM. The benefits and drawbacks of using SSM including the human-activity system and mapping the activities onto a TLCM cube (architectural) model are discussed.},

  abstract={The paper addresses system modelling and engineering in cooperative distributed environments. Multi-agent systems, ontologies and web technologies are used for the support and management of resources in a distributed virtual environment. Distributed design involves dispersed heterogeneous teams of people who have to establish and maintain an efficient cooperation process in order to reach global 'optimal' solutions to various problems. Key needs addressed by the introduced multi-agent system refer to inter operation among distributed resources and knowledge sharing, reuse and integration. An ontology library creates a common shared understanding of the domain for inter operating agents. The proposed system employs agents for information storage and retrieval, for enhancing collaboration within a distributed design environment and for providing a suitable interface to the user. The agents offer content-related support to the user by committing to the same library of ontologies. The proposed multi-agent design information management system aims to facilitate the optimization of the solution space of the collective dispersed design team.},

  abstract={In software engineering, one of the process improvement methods is through empirical studies. We compare several empirical studies on ontology engineering to discuss potential empirical works on our domain of interest, namely the learning process improvement. Subsequently, we conduct an assessment on novice modelers to determine the effects of ontology on subjects' learning process. The p-values indicate that there is a significant difference between the group that is provided with ontology (ontology group) and the group that is not (control group). Furthermore, the mean scores for comprehensiveness and confidence in the ontology group are slightly higher than in the control group. We conclude that the use of ontology may positively contribute to the learning process especially with the learners involved in the ontology engineering process.},

In the first place, a collaborative service framework aiding design resources reuse is established to help encapsulate reusable resources. Meanwhile, to realize interoperability between function and data of heterogeneous resources, shared ontology and private ontology are separately built for different design disciplines and tool resources within the disciplines. Then, collaborative service planning is divided into different stages. And generating algorithm serving planning program is proposed to obtain feasible program collection of service composition. Finally, taking design of aero engine compressor as an example, the effectiveness of collaborative service planning algorithm is verified by providing an atomic service ontology instance.},

Responses were automatically classified into 10 different categories, which were derived from a codebook created for the content analysis of the responses. Results show that most responses were classified in the category Local Government Unit (LGU) accountability. The classifier achieved a 93.3% mean accuracy with ten-fold cross validation. This analysis shows that the created classifier module can successfully decode responses and can be further improved by applying multi-label classification. However, the classifier achieved 63.8% agreement with the manual coding, and a revision of the code book may be deemed necessary as a future work. The application of pre-processors such as spelling checkers can also be considered.},

  abstract={A number of developed countries employ ontology in e-government projects. On the other hand, E-government is gaining more and more acceptance in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. However, little work is done in building knowledge base ontologies guaranteeing the integration, maintainability, interoperability and sustainability of applications. In this paper, we present a case study of constructing ontology in support of e-government initiatives for development projects monitoring in a SSA country. Case studies of development projects conducted in different SSA countries as well as related published works in various fields including project management, project monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building are reviewed and the features of the ontology are extracted. The resulting ontology aims at: providing developers of potential e-government applications for development projects monitoring in Sub Saharan Africa and the developing world in large with key concepts and activities of the domain, facilitating communication amongst all the role players involved in development projects implementation by providing a common and shared representation of concepts and activities of the domain, and serving as a knowledge base system to the monitoring and evaluation activities of development projects; thereby, strengthening efficiency, effective and sustainable implementation of development projects in Sub Saharan Africa. Further, the study aims at sensitizing and serving as a practical case study of building ontology in support of e-government adoption processes in Sub Saharan Africa.},

Our research community's understanding of the work processes and practices of intelligence analysts is not deep enough to adequately address their needs. Without a better understanding of the analysts and their problems, we cannot build visual analytics systems that integrate well with their work processes and truly provide benefit to them. In order to close this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal, observational field study of intelligence analysts in training within the intelligence program at Mercyhurst College. We observed three teams of analysts, each working on an intelligence problem for a ten-week period. Based upon study findings, we describe and characterize processes and methods of intelligence analysis that we observed, make clarifications regarding the processes and practices, and suggest design implications for visual analytics systems for intelligence analysis.},

  abstract={Storyline visualizations are an effective means to present the evolution of plots and reveal the scenic interactions among characters. However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.},

Most applications with collaboration concepts reported in the literature focus on enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-making processes in objective and well-structured workflows. However, relatively few previous studies have investigated the applications of collaboration schemes to problems with subjective and unstructured nature. In this paper, we explore a new intelligent collaboration scheme for fashion design which, by nature, relies heavily on human judgment and creativity. Techniques such as multicriteria decision making, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network (ANN) models are employed. Industrial data sets are used for the analysis. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed scheme exhibits significant improvement over the traditional method in terms of the time-cost effectiveness, and a company interview with design professionals has confirmed its effectiveness and significance.},

  abstract={Concerns about the impact unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will have on society is growing, making the consideration of ethics in UAV design urgent. Privacy, safety, and security are widely discussed, but engineers have few tools to address these and other ethical issues in their designs. This paper contributes by helping to bridge the gap between ethical theory and design practice. To do so, the concept of capability caution in UAV design is introduced. Capability caution in UAV design is the need for setting well-reasoned limits to the technology's capabilities during the design phase, both to limit risks of misuse, but also to enhance performance within the specified application. Five capability caution design principles are developed which should be considered: 1. context of use 2. privacy 3. jobs and human skills 4. safety, security, and misuse, and 5. the future. A Danish healthcare UAV that has been designed using the capability caution design principles is presented to illustrate the approach.},

  abstract={This paper describes a research project that investigated the feasibility of using contextual reasoning to supervise the collaborative work of knowledge workers. In complex projects that require contributions from various experts but whose interaction may be limited to a web-based collaborative tool, proper management of the project is essential to ensure that the project objectives are met. This is typically the job of a project manager. We assert that having situational awareness is likewise essential to managing a project, and we utilize Context-based Reasoning (CxBR) as the tool of choice for implementing situational awareness in an agent that assists project managers. We use rocket design and manufacture as the domain to evaluate our approach. We make use of public domain rocket design software developed by NASA as a guide to the domain. The paper describes the investigation and the related works involved in collaborative design project, as embodied by designing and building a small rocket.},

  abstract={Recent research has focused on the use of ontologies to promote the sharing of knowledge. Ontologies are becoming increasingly important because they provide the critical semantic foundation for the rapidly expanding field of knowledge. They are very useful for knowledge reuse, knowledge sharing, and enterprise modeling. A design ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a design domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base. It can help the collaborative design team by providing accurate design information and guidelines. This research develops a methodology called domain knowledge acquisition process (DKAP) for creating an ontology of product and process design using IDEF5 and generates a consistency matrix for checking the accuracy of captured information. DKAP is a step-by-step methodology, which captures the product & process design knowledge, stores this knowledge in a reusable format, and shares this knowledge across enterprises. DKAP addresses three critical aspects of a design ontology. It explores the availability of similar domain ontologies for reuse, checks the accuracy & consistency of captured knowledge, and allows the sharing of the captured knowledge.},

Aiming at addressing this issue, through design, we developed a digital-analogue model playground to help them understand and cope with the socially difficult situations experienced when they go to a physical playground to interact with peers. Based on therapists and parents' insights, we created the model playground with built in collaborative protocols providing immediate feedback to the children in terms of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Our design artefact was evaluated in a rehabilitation clinic for autistic children and demonstrates promising potential for digital-analogue devices as useful resources training peer social interaction. Our findings document that digital-analogue design devices can facilitate the development of social skills and norms through peer learning activities amongst children with autism.},

This paper has been written with motivation to present various ideas of experts and professionals from an academic environment that represent different scientific fields of work such as telecommunications, control engineering, traffic engineering, information and communication technologies, etc. The authors believe that using the case of the University of Žilina (UNIZA) the multidisciplinary and synergic character of the topic may be emphasized sufficiently. Therefore a special content form of the paper has been used, based on the “question-answer” pattern. Traditionally prepared papers usually follow one of two possible lines: integration dimension - from research mono-thematically oriented on one technology only up to the fully integrated approach, or socio-technical dimension- from solution of purely technical problems up to the socio-technical perspectives and position of a human in the whole chain. This paper aims to raise a set of key questions representing the most urgent problems of today's smart city agenda and answers to them.},

  pages={362-368},
  abstract={A critical issue during human-agent and human-robot interaction is eliciting an intentional stance in the human interactor, whereas the human perceives the agent as a fully "intelligent" being with full agency towards their own intentions and desires. Eliciting such a stance, however, has proven elusive, despite work in cognitive science, robotics, and human-computer interaction over the past half-century. Here, we argue for a paradigm shift in our approach to this problem, based on a synthesis of recent evidence from social robotics and digital avatars. In short, in order to trigger an intentional stance in humans, perhaps our artificial agents need to adopt one about themselves.},

  abstract={Digital business transformation (DBT) is a significant trend in all industries, and affects all businesses, large and small. Companies that resist digitalisation and systemic transformation risk losing market share or even completely going out of business. Effective communication, both internal and external, and collaboration are vital for transformation success. This paper investigates executives’ perceptions of the disruptions leading to the need for DBT, whether such a transformation is considered a challenge or even a crisis by company executives, and the communication strategies that are implemented for DBT in various pipe extrusion companies in Germany. This research adopts a qualitative approach and semi-structured interviews were used in our research to gather data from experts in the companies. The research found that most companies in the pipe extrusion industry in Germany acknowledge and can articulate disruptions, both current and future. However, they but do not regard digital transformation of their business as a crisis and most companies have not prepared strategies for effectively communicating their response to digital transformation challenges.},

  year={2023},
  volume={19},
  number={7},
  pages={8362-8373},
  abstract={Nowadays, more data are represented and stored by a graph structure, and subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in a variety of scientific machine learning and industrial applications, such as remote sensing image registration, industrial inspection, etc. Due to the nondeterministic polynominal hard (NP-hard) problem of subgraph matching, the explosive growth of graph data, the disadvantages of high energy consumption, and the high overhead of CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, computing subgraph matching is becoming more and more challenging. To alleviate this problem, we propose a phased hybrid algorithm to accelerate the enumeration task of subgraph matching, called PH-CF, based on the CPU-field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) heterogeneous platform. This approach can make full use of the pipeline and data flow mechanism, low power consumption, and configurable characteristics of FPGA. First, the matching order of query vertices automatically selects GraphQL (GQL) or RI methods according to the sparsity of the data (query) graph. Second, a candidate vertex auxiliary data structure set partitioning method is designed to effectively realize the load balance of multiple computing units at the FPGA and CPU host sides. Third, FPGA's pipeline and data flow mechanism is used to accelerate the enumeration phase of subgraph matching. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the performance of the PH-CF outperforms the state-of-the-arts. PH-CF can obtain the average performance improvement of up to $16.07\times$, $38.61\times$, and $11.46\times$ over CFL, CECI, and DP-iso, respectively. Moreover, our approach has good stability and robustness on various datasets.},

  abstract={To solve the problem that the single robot task execution capability is not enough to meet the whole handling task demand under complex conditions, the hybrid path planning models such as multi-robot path planning and formation cooperative control considering obstacle avoidance are studied. Firstly, for the robot global path finding problem, on the basis of the construction for a robot working environment model based on the geometric map model building method, an improved particle swarm algorithm-based global path planning model is proposed to solve the problems of low robot path planning solution efficiency and easy to fall into local optimal solutions. Secondly, for the multi-robot cooperative formation control and obstacle avoidance and inter-robot collision avoidance problems, a multi-robot formation local path planning model based on the improved artificial potential field method is constructed, a simulated annealing algorithm is introduced to optimize the traditional artificial potential field method, and a multi-robot formation control strategy, robot obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance methods are designed in combination with the pilot-following method to improve the robot formation path exploration The proposed method can improve the path exploration capability and handling efficiency of robot formation. Finally, the global path planning model of the robot based on the improved particle swarm algorithm is simulated and analyzed using Matlab 7.0 to verify the outstanding performance of the model in pathfinding capability. Then the local path planning model of multi-robot formation based on the improved artificial potential field is simulated and analyzed to verify the improved algorithm has good path planning as well as obstacle avoidance performance. The hybrid path planning model is applied to a real case and simulated, and the results show that the improved algorithm improves the exploration capability of the robot formation, effectively avoids obstacles, and verifies its reliability and superiority in the hybrid path planning process.},

  abstract={With the increasing complexity of urban transportation system, serious traffic congestion brings inconvenience to travel. It is also very difficult to predict and control traffic congestion. Therefore, this paper takes urban traffic condition and traffic congestion as the research object, and conducts in-depth research on traffic condition prediction model and traffic congestion control method. Firstly, a traffic state prediction method based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) optimized radial basis function (RBF) and long and short term memory network (LSTM)/ support vector machine (SVM) feature fusion model was proposed for urban traffic state prediction. Experiments were carried out based on the regional traffic data of Shenyang Station, and compared with other algorithms, which verified the superiority of the feature fusion model based on IPSO-RBF and LSTM/SVM in this paper. Secondly, aiming at the problem of urban traffic congestion, a congestion Section control method based on traffic allocation is proposed. Through VISSIM simulation and comparison with other traffic control schemes, the superiority of the congestion Section optimization method proposed in this paper is verified.},

  pages={1625-1632},
  abstract={Socially-assistive robots (SARs) hold significant potential to transform the management of chronic healthcare conditions (e.g. diabetes, Alzheimer’s, dementia) outside the clinic walls. However doing so entails embedding such autonomous robots into people’s daily lives and home living environments, which are deeply shaped by the cultural and geographic locations within which they are situated. That begs the question whether we can design autonomous interactive behaviors between SARs and humans based on universal machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models of robotic sensor data that would work across such diverse environments? To investigate this, we conducted a long-term user study with 26 participants across two diverse locations (United States and South Korea) with SARs deployed in each user’s home for several weeks. We collected robotic sensor data every second of every day, combined with sophisticated ecological momentary assessment (EMA) sampling techniques, to generate a large-scale dataset of over 270 million data points representing 173 hours of randomly-sampled naturalistic interaction data between the human and SAR. Models built on that data were capable of achieving nearly 84% accuracy for detecting specific interaction modalities (AUC 0.885) when trained/tested on the same location, though suffered significant performance drops when applied to a different location. Further analysis and participant interviews showed that was likely due to differences in home living environments in the US and Korea. The results suggest that our ability to create adaptable behaviors for robotic pets may be dependent on the human-robot interaction (HRI) data available for modeling.},

The key technologies, standards, and laws of intelligent remote sensing satellites are also experiencing a series of new challenges.

The aim of these intelligent remote sensing satellites is to provide real-time, accurate, and personalized remote sensing information services. This article reviews the current developments in new-generation intelligent remote sensing satellite systems, with a focus on intelligent remote sensing satellite platforms, imaging payloads, onboard processing systems, and other key technological chains. The technological breakthroughs and current defects of intelligence-oriented designs are also analyzed. Intelligent remote sensing satellites collect personalized remote sensing data and information, with real-time data features and information interaction between remote sensing satellites or between satellites and the ground. Such developments will expand the use of remote sensing applications beyond government departments and industrial users to a massive number of individual users.

  abstract={Care costs of People with Dementia (PwDs) bear a tremendous burden on healthcare systems around the world. Smart Homes (SHs), as an instance of the ambient assisted living technology, can help reduce these expenses. However, only few of the existing studies in the literature discuss how SHs should be designed by considering the unique requirements of PwDs. Most of the studies view dementia care as a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific needs of PwDs. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems to PwDs as well as other stakeholders in the sector of dementia care. The present research reports on the requirements elicitation, design and evaluation of a dedicated SH prototype for PwDs. In contrast to most of the existing SH systems proposed for PwDs, this work presents a tailored prototype that is based on a user-centred design methodology. The preliminary evaluation by a sample of stakeholders shows the suitability of the proposed methodology and consequently the resulting prototype for reducing care difficulties as well as its potential of deployment in the real-world environment.},

  abstract={Research has shown that over half of those with MCI will develop dementia within 5 years. In 2017, approximately 50 million people have dementia in the world. Moreover, dementia is now the 7th leading cause of death. Now almost 600 thousand people aged 65 or over are MCI in Taiwan. The ratio of people aged 65 years or over in Taiwan will reach 20% by 2025. According to the results of several studies, 3-19% of adults over the age of 65 meet the criteria for MCI. The majority of care for PWCI is provided by family carers. Using assistive technologies (AT) to help PWCI live independently can reduce the costs of care for PWCI. AT can support communication, monitor and reminders to meet the requirements of socialization, safety and cognition for PWCI, respectively. In this research, we propose an intelligent cognition assistant (iCA) to improve living qualities for PWCI using modern assistive technologies. The system has three major functions: companion, cognitive rehabilitation and evaluation, and daily activities assistant. A friendly and intelligent dialog interface, digital cognitive exercises, multidimensional cognitive evaluation and activities monitors are provided to achieve these goals.},

  abstract={The last five years has seen an exponential increase in interest around the notion of a digital twin. Multiple systematic reviews have established a base set of findings which are now broadly taken as assumptions in the field. The findings have outlined frameworks, integration patterns, distinctions between product and process oriented digital twins, simulation and the leveraging of artificial intelligence to support prediction and optimisation. As the use cases of digital twins have evolved from a predominance in manufacturing and into the sociotechnical domain to support the social world, a gap emerges between the social requirements and the technical machinery of digital twins. This gap is significant and worthy of exploration as it presents important challenges for digital twin research including use of sociotechnical design methods, problems arising from a so-called abstraction gap and various epistemological concerns. This paper proposes an analytical route to ameliorating the sociotechnical gap which is discussed within a future notion of an Environment Digital Twin.},

  abstract={While scholars involved in studying the ethics and politics flowing from digital information and communication systems have sought to impact the design and deployment of digital technologies, the fast pace and iterative tempo of technical development in these contexts, and the lack of structured engagement with sociotechnical questions, have been major barriers to ensuring values are considered explicitly in the R&D process. Here I introduce Apologos, a lightweight design methodology informed by the author's experience of the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and social sciences over a five-year period. Apologos, which is inspired by “design apologetics”, is intended as an initial mechanism to introduce technologists to the process of considering how human values impact the digital design process.},

  year={2012},

  pages={36-44},
  abstract={Designing complex and reasonable 3D environments for modern 3D games is one of the time consuming challenges faced by present video game industry. We have critically reviewed the existing approaches to automate the design of 3D environments. It was identified that current 3D environment generation techniques being specific to one or few types of environments and the lack of customizable frameworks which are common to many types of environments as the main issues to be addressed. According to literature, surprisingly complex and interesting global behaviours can arise in multi agent systems as a result of simple rules that are followed by number of simple agents operate in an environment. We hypothesize that this emergent behaviour of multi agent systems can be used to design 3D game environments with emergence properties that were not visible in initial constituents. The proposed solution provides a multi agent based approach to develop a framework which is common to design many types of 3D game environments. Each 3D model in a 3D game environment is associated with an agent with simple rules and this system allows users to introduce new 3D models and associate them with agent types. The main input for the proposed system is a parameterized description of an imaginary 3D environment. Output of the system is a 3D game environment with self organized 3D models positioned and oriented in most suitable places. The proposed approach has been evaluated by implementing a prototype and comparing the proposed approach with traditional 3D game environment design approaches.},

  pages={000159-000164},
  abstract={Developing a (Consumer) Robotics Product is not easy. Most companies, at least in the domain of industrial robotics, tend to rely on a Technology Push-based methodology. They develope a product as good as they can, trying to include their newest technological breakthroughs. When the product is finished, they advertise and sell it based on its feature set and competitive advantage. Unfortunately, this sometimes doesn't really take into account the desires and needs of (esp.) new markets. Hence, we applied a Market Pull-based approach: Use Case Driven Requirements Engineering (UCD-RE), starting with the analysis of Megatrends to understand future market developments. So far, no earlier evidence of such an approach for the development of a robotics product could be found in literature. As commonly agreed, Megatrends will affect our lives both professionally and in private, bringing huge business opportunities for companies - but only in the long run as their effects are relatively limited in the beginning. Yet, their effects will finally even break down encrusted structures and will make outdated business models obsolete. Therefore, new market entries or established companies that want a strategic reorientation have to focus firstly on the megatrends as they must understand the impact of the changes induced will have on customers. The company then must define which requirements and competencies are needed as well as which conditions have to be fulfilled to provide these customers with solutions resp. products and services. In our paper we outline the following approach: Firstly, we identified the most relevant Megatrends affecting the Consumer Robotics domain, then we derived a Use Case(s) and finally we outlined the overview of the necessary conditions and requirements to ensure a success story.},

  abstract={The objective of a virtual assistant is to use web-based data sources, user-generated content, and knowledge from knowledge libraries. An Intelligent virtual assistant's main purpose is to deliver solutions to users' questions. It is possible to do it in a business setting, like on a company website with a chat interface. Virtual assistant is very helpful especially for elder as well as for people with cognitive disability such as Alzheimer's disease. For someone with physical limitations, a virtual assistant can be very useful. Seniors with poor vision or limited mobility, for example, one can operate the device simply by speaking into it. New techniques of caring for the elderly that include advanced information and communication technology are desperately required. As a percentage of the total population, the world's senior population is rapidly growing, but the fraction of the working population who will create the resources to assist the aged is declining. Voice searches have a number of advantages for elders as well as for cognitive disability such as speed. In fact, voice searches are much faster than written searches. A survey has been carried out in this work in which some questions have been asked from elderly people and people with abnormality or disability. The questions were based on Virtual Assistant. The aim of this task was to evaluate how many people use these assistants in their everyday life. Based on this survey it has been concluded that the prevalence of Virtual Assistants is growing in our day to day lives.},

  pages={2182-2198},
  abstract={As an important source of inspiration, the great number of patent documents provides designers with valuable knowledge of design rationale (DR), including issues, intent, pros and cons of the solutions. Researchers have carried out a number of data analysis studies based on patent information, which is now a new discipline called Patinformatics, including the analysis of patent information from a macro perspective and the identification and extraction of patent knowledge from a micro perspective. If DR knowledge could be extracted automatically from the patent documents and provided to designers as a source of inspiration, it would greatly promote innovative design, and at the same time promote the reuse of patent documents and the wide application of DR theory, which can be like killing three birds with one stone. To address this issue, this study proposes an improved lexical-syntactic pattern method for DR centric patent knowledge extraction, including DR Vector Space model (DRVS), DRV Trigger Word (DRV-TW), Design Rationale Vector (DRV), DR credibility (DRC) and others, and DRV based knowledge extraction algorithms. Knowledge extraction experiments were conducted on 1491 patent documents to verify the feasibility and performance of the method. In addition, two other sets of comparative experiments were conducted using the FastText and BERT machine learning methods, and the results further confirmed the reliability of the proposed method for low-resource corpus.},

  abstract={Software Project Management (SPM) is considered the key driver for the success or failure of software projects. Project failure is caused by various factors, the most important of which is poor SPM. Thus, we investigated the needs of practitioners by focusing on Project Management Q&A communities. More precisely, we targeted Stack Exchange to identify the primary needs of software project managers. More than 5000 SPM questions were analyzed from the conceptual model given by the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK. For pre-training of the Machine Learning classifiers, we implemented Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Doc2Vec text embedding and compared their performance. Our results showed that BERT outperforms Doc2Vec for pre-training in almost all scenarios. Schedule management, followed by resource management, are the main PMBOK knowledge areas of concern for project managers. Among the process groups, the emphasis of the questions is on planning. We compared the findings with the learning and training status quo in 11 top Canadian universities. We analyzed 46 SPM-related courses and found that the rank correlation of PMBOK knowledge areas is 0.23 between the key content of the analyzed courses and the focus of Q&A’s knowledge areas analyzed from Stack Exchange.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={115603-115623},
  abstract={The COVID-19 crisis has attracted attention worldwide to supply chain disruptions and resilience. Several supply chain risk management approaches have been revisited or reapplied in the literature; however, collaborative resource sharing is less researched. This study aimed to investigate the current academic state of the art and advances in using collaborative resource sharing as a reactive method to facilitate supply chain recovery in the presence of disruptive events. More specifically we considered the role of different collaborative resource-sharing strategies that organizations can adopt to support supply chain functionalities during times of disruption. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2000 to 2022. In order to analyze the literature, we adopted a combination of text-mining, automatic and manual categorization of selected articles, and exploratory analyses such as cluster analysis and relational indicators. We also consider the machine learning classification algorithm i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering for the categorization of clusters. The findings show that, for disruptive risks, collaborative sharing of labour and material resources is effective for the recovery of supply chains. More so, labour resources tend to contribute more to the recovery of supply chains through the physical and mental recreation of recovery activities and experiences. Whilst information resources and a mix of information and material resources are highly important in reducing the impact of COVID-19 disruptive supply chain risk. In conclusion, collaborating on the three resources, namely labour, material, and information resources can be an effective post-disruption recovery strategy for supply chains.},

  abstract={The study of microstructure of materials is of great significance in the field of materials science. The interdisciplinary cooperation of materials science and computer science makes it more accurate and efficient to explore the relationship between material microstructure and material properties. Machine learning has potential in exploring the relationship between microstructure and properties of materials. This paper proposes adding the morphology features of grains into the construction of grain knowledge graph to enrich the grain information in the graph. First, an autoencoder extracts the grain morphology features and adds them to the grain knowledge graph. Then, the graph convolutional network is used to extract the features of the graph, and the fully connected network is used to predict the properties of the material. Experiments are performed on actual EBSD scanning data. The experimental results show that the proposed method has noticeable improvement over the competing methods.},

  abstract={Many studies have attested to the efficacy of integrating innovative methods of teaching computing and engineering, especially for introductory students and at the K-12 level. As an example, robots have been successfully used to teach a wide range of subjects, from introductory programming to artificial intelligence. As a discipline, wearable computing is seen to be practical, yet futuristic and exciting, and it captures the attention and interest of people who might not otherwise be drawn to technology. Recent developments in this field have also raised the possibility of moving wearable computing construction within the reach of hobbyists and novices. However, there still exist substantial obstacles toward the adoption of wearable computing into education. This paper presents a framework with the objective of facilitating the integration of wearable computing into outreach and introductory computer science and engineering education. We also present a comprehensive evaluation of our platform, including a comparison with the current practice of sewing-based wearable computing.},

  abstract={The ubiquitous presence of software in the products we use, together with Artificial Intelligence in these products, has led to an increasing need for consumer trust. Consumers often lose faith in products, and the lack of Trust propagates to the companies behind them. This is even more so in mission-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and clinical support systems. This paper follows grounded theory principles to elicit knowledge related to Trust, Ethics, and Transparency. We approach these qualities as Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), aiming to build catalogs to subsidize the construction of Socially Responsible Software. The corpus we have used was built on a selected collection of literature on Corporate Social Responsibility, with an emphasis on Business Ethics. Our challenge is how to encode the social perspective knowledge, mainly through the view of Corporate Social Responsibility, on how organizations or institutions achieve trustworthiness. Since our ground perspective is that of NFRs, results are presented by a catalogue of Trust as a Non-Functional Requirement, represented as a Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG). The SIG language helps software engineers in understanding alternatives they have to improve Trust in software products.},

  abstract={In order to confront the challenge of creating robotics with a social impact, this paper speculates on how to allow anybody anywhere hands-on opportunity to make contextualized solutions. Inspired by embodied artificial intelligence and modular robotics, we present the building block approach as a way to achieve user-driven innovation of high tech solutions with a social impact. Modularity invites to physical manipulation and reconfiguration, and in the process of physical manipulation, the user starts understanding and developing the functionality. Through immediate action in the interaction, the user is not only learning about the abstract thinking that the system may represent, but at the same time, the user is able to try the system in new, innovative configurations. Hence, the system becomes a true engine for innovation allowing the user to creatively invent, build and test new developments as the exploration is happening. As instantiations of this building block approach and its social impact, we briefly review the development and use of modular robotic devices for education, health improvements, and business in Africa. We briefly outline the modular building blocks for education, modular interactive tiles for rehabilitation in Tanzania and for soccer tournaments in Africa, Asia and Europe.},

In this paper, an innovative simulation framework for the simulation of tendon-driven robots is presented. It consists of a generic physics simulator capable of utilizing CAD robot models and a set of additional tools for simulation control, data acquisition and system investigation. The framework software architecture has been designed using component-based development principles to facilitate the framework extension and customization. Furthermore, for inter-component communication, the operating-system and programming language independent Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [1] has been used which simplifies the integration of the framework into existing software environments.},

Employing the Lyapunov function method and the subsequence technique, the sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the  $pth$  moments (ES- $pth$ ) of the system are established. Generally, even if all the Markovian jump subsystems (MJSSs) are not ES- $pth$  in the absence of impulses, impulses can still be used to achieve the ES- $pth$  of the system in a specially designed interval, that is, when the impulses and Markovian jump signals meet the corresponding conditions. On the contrary, when all MJSSs are stable without impulses, as long as the impulses parameters and Markovian jump signals are relatively balanced, the system can still maintain the property of ES- $pth$ .

  abstract={Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers’ disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers’ disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.

  abstract={Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a widely adopted agile methodology for software development that emphasizes the behavior of an application as a series of test cases, using the keywords, which include “Given,” “When,” and “Then.” It involves writing requirements in a structured and testable format that can be evaluated to ensure compliance with the expected behavior. Although a significant amount of research has been conducted to examine the impact of using BDD on software development process yet rare work is observed to synthesize these studies and identify areas for future exploration. This study presents a review of the state-of-the-art BDD by synthesizing the recent advancements in its uses and applications. It aims to systematically investigate the impact of BDD on software development process as well as on product quality by aiding to bridge the communication gap between the stakeholders. The results reveal that BDD is an effective technique to clarify requirements during the software development process as it helps minimizing the intrinsic ambiguities. This work proposes a taxonomy based on the role and applications of BDD in various contexts. It suggests a framework for applying BDD in software development and defines a workflow for its application in software development. Finally, this work highlights some pertinent future directions for the use of BDD in software development.},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={3},
  pages={1867-1881},
  abstract={To resolve the distortion resulting from the mismatch between the interval partition and the watermark distribution in the reversible watermarking based on difference expansion, an investigation is made to difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning. It is found that the conventional floating number-based methods with uniform interval partitioning are not fully considering different watermark distributions, and the embedding distortion can be optimized. Thus, a reversible watermarking based on difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning is put forward for 2D engineering graphics. Each interval is adaptively partitioned into $2^{s}$2s sub-intervals, and the watermark is embedded via transforming the positions of the vertices to its corresponding sub-intervals. The watermark extraction is accomplished by acquiring the indices of the sub-intervals of the watermarked vertices, and the graphics recovery is achieved by moving the watermarked vertices to the reverse direction. Moreover, a new polar coordinate system is built to be invariant to overall geometric transformation and vertices rearrangement. Experimental results and analysis indicate that it maintains good authentication ability and semi-fragility. Furthermore, its imperceptibility is significantly improved compared with the existing watermarking schemes under the same experimental conditions.},

  pages={10576-10587},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has entered a stage of rapid development and increasing deployment. Meanwhile, these low-power devices typically cannot support complex security mechanisms and, thus, are highly susceptible to malware. This article proposes ADRIoT, an anomaly detection framework for IoT networks, which leverages edge computing to uncover potential threats. An edge is empowered with an anomaly detection module, which consists of a traffic capturer, a traffic preprocessor, and a collection of anomaly detectors dedicated to each type of device. Each detector is constructed by an LSTM autoencoder in an unsupervised manner that requires no labeled attack data and is able to handle emerging zero-day attacks. When a device connects to the edge, the edge will fetch the corresponding detector from the cloud and execute it locally. Another problem is the resource constraint of a single edge device like a home router hinders the deployment of such a detection module. To mitigate this problem, we design a multiedge collaborative mechanism that integrates the resource of multiple edges in a local network to increase the overall load capacity. The evaluation demonstrates that ADRIoT can detect various IoT-based attacks effectively and efficiently, showing that ADRIoT can feasibly help build a more secure IoT environment.},

  year={2023},
  volume={29},

  pages={331-341},
  abstract={Glyph-based visualization achieves an impressive graphic design when associated with comprehensive visual metaphors, which help audiences effectively grasp the conveyed information through revealing data semantics. However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.},

  abstract={When fully implemented, sixth generation (6G) wireless systems will constitute intelligent wireless networks that enable not only ubiquitous communication but also high-accuracy localization services. They will be the driving force behind this transformation by introducing a new set of characteristics and service capabilities in which location will coexist with communication while sharing available resources. To that purpose, this survey investigates the envisioned applications and use cases of localization in future 6G wireless systems, while analyzing the impact of the major technology enablers. Afterwards, system models for millimeter wave, terahertz and visible light positioning that take into account both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS channels are presented, while localization key performance indicators are revisited alongside mathematical definitions. Moreover, a detailed review of the state of the art conventional and learning-based localization techniques is conducted. Furthermore, the localization problem is formulated, the wireless system design is considered and the optimization of both is investigated. Finally, insights that arise from the presented analysis are summarized and used to highlight the most important future directions for localization in 6G wireless systems.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is on the verge of a major paradigm shift. In the IoT system of the future, IoFT, the “cloud” will be substituted by the “crowd” where model training is brought to the edge, allowing IoT devices to collaboratively extract knowledge and build smart analytics/models while keeping their personal data stored locally. This paradigm shift was set into motion by the tremendous increase in computational power on IoT devices and the recent advances in decentralized and privacy-preserving model training, coined as federated learning (FL). This article provides a vision for IoFT and a systematic overview of current efforts towards realizing this vision. Specifically, we first introduce the defining characteristics of IoFT and discuss FL data-driven approaches, opportunities, and challenges that allow decentralized inference within three dimensions: (i) a global model that maximizes utility across all IoT devices, (ii) a personalized model that borrows strengths across all devices yet retains its own model, (iii) a meta-learning model that quickly adapts to new devices or learning tasks. We end by describing the vision and challenges of IoFT in reshaping different industries through the lens of domain experts. Those industries include manufacturing, transportation, energy, healthcare, quality & reliability, business, and computing.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={70110-70131},
  abstract={A secured platform is a critical component of digital governance, as it helps to ensure the privacy, security, and reliability of the electronic platforms and systems used to manage and deliver public services. Interoperability and data exchange are essential for digital governance, as they enable different government agencies and departments to share data, information, and resources seamlessly, regardless of the platforms and technologies they use. In this paper, we build a secure platform to enhance the trustworthiness of digital governance interoperability and data exchange using blockchain and deep learning-based frameworks. Initially, an optimal blockchain leveraging approach is designed using the bonobo optimization algorithm to authenticate data generated from smart city environments. Furthermore, we introduce the integration of a lightweight Feistel structure with optimal operations to enhance privacy preservation. This integration provides two levels of security and ensures interoperability and double-secured data exchange in digital governance systems. In addition, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to detect and prevent intrusions such as fraud/corruption in the smart city data. This approach enhances transparency and accountability in accessing the data and shows its predominance over other cutting-edge techniques on two benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework in real-time scenarios has been demonstrated through two case studies. Overall, our proposed framework provides a trustworthy platform for digital governance, interoperability, and data exchange, addressing the challenges of privacy, security, and reliability in managing and delivering public services.},

  title={Ontology-based exchange of product data semantics}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={2},
  number={3},
  pages={213-225},
  abstract={An increasing trend toward product development in a collaborative environment has resulted in the use of various software tools to enhance the product design. This requires a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across different application domains. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to enable such semantic interoperability. A standards-based approach is used to develop a Product Semantic Representation Language (PSRL). Formal description logic (DAML+OIL) is used to encode the PSRL. Mathematical logic and corresponding reasoning is used to determine semantic equivalences between an application ontology and the PSRL. The semantic equivalence matrix enables resolution of ambiguities created due to differences in syntaxes and meanings associated with terminologies in different application domains. Successful semantic interoperability will form the basis of seamless communication and thereby enable better integration of product development systems. Note to Practitioners-Semantic interoperability of product information refers to automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data, among information resources throughout the product development. This research is motivated by the problems in enabling such semantic interoperability. First, product information is formalized into an explicit, extensible, and comprehensive product semantics representation language (PSRL). The PSRL is open and based on standard W3C constructs. Next, in order to enable semantic translation, the paper describes a procedure to semi-automatically determine mappings between exactly equivalent concepts across representations of the interacting applications. The paper demonstrates that this approach to translation is feasible, but it has not yet been implemented commercially. Current limitations and the directions for further research are discussed. Future research addresses the determination of semantic similarities (not exact equivalences) between the interacting information resources.},

  year={2021},
  volume={18},

  pages={1441-1455},
  abstract={The proliferation of various mobile devices equipped with cameras results in an exponential growth of the amount of images. Recent advances in the deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made CNN feature extraction become an effective way to process these images. However, it is still a challenging task to deploy the CNN model on the mobile sensors, which are typically resource-constrained in terms of the storage space, the computing capacity, and the battery life. Although cloud computing has become a popular solution, data security and response latency are always the key issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework for privacy-preserving CNN feature extraction for mobile sensing based on edge computing. To get the most out of the benefits of CNN with limited physical resources on the mobile sensors, we design a series of secure interaction protocols and utilize two edge servers to collaboratively perform the CNN feature extraction. The proposed scheme allows us to significantly reduce the latency and the overhead of the end devices while preserving privacy. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of our scheme.},

  title={xViTCOS: Explainable Vision Transformer Based COVID-19 Screening Using Radiography}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Objective: Since its outbreak, the rapid spread of COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the globe has pushed the health care system in many countries to the verge of collapse. Therefore, it is imperative to correctly identify COVID-19 positive patients and isolate them as soon as possible to contain the spread of the disease and reduce the ongoing burden on the healthcare system. The primary COVID-19 screening test, RT-PCR although accurate and reliable, has a long turn-around time. In the recent past, several researchers have demonstrated the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods on chest radiography (such as X-ray and CT) for COVID-19 detection. However, existing CNN based DL methods fail to capture the global context due to their inherent image-specific inductive bias. Methods: Motivated by this, in this work, we propose the use of vision transformers (instead of convolutional networks) for COVID-19 screening using the X-ray and CT images. We employ a multi-stage transfer learning technique to address the issue of data scarcity. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by our transformer networks are explainable. Results: We demonstrate that our method not only quantitatively outperforms the recent benchmarks but also focuses on meaningful regions in the images for detection (as confirmed by Radiologists), aiding not only in accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 but also in localization of the infected area. The code for our implementation can be found here - https://github.com/arnabkmondal/xViTCOS. Conclusion: The proposed method will help in timely identification of COVID-19 and efficient utilization of limited resources.},
