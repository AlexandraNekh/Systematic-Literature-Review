  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has long been recognised. However, the realisation of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavoured to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SMEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SMEs in Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporationpsilas (BSCIC) 70 industrial estates is still in its infancy. One of the factors that have been identified as impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SMEs is access to, and confidence on ICT. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded enterprise growth and bank modernization project and explores the opportunities and potentials of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SMEs in Bangladesh.},

  pages={237-241},
  abstract={Servitization concerns the process of manufacturers shifting from a focus on producing and selling tangible goods to service-based business models. Factors that drive adoption of servitization are financial, strategic (competitive advantage) and marketing. However, uptake is slow and active efforts are being made to transfer knowledge about servitization to the manufacturing sector. This paper presents early results from the first test of a serious computer game which has the goal of educating managers about what advanced services are and how they fit in supply chains. Results suggest the role-play scenario tested is appropriate for an audience of largely non-expert gamers, and that the approach has the potential to instruct users about the role of services in the supply chain.},

  abstract={Over 1 billion people suffer from the effects of water scarcity with the majority being poor residents of developing countries. Desalting seawater is an excellent potential solution but reverse osmosis (R/O) desalination systems require a connection to a strong electrical grid. However, because developing countries typically lack sufficient electrical grid capacity and cannot afford the capital or time required to build and deploy traditional R/O systems, Resolute Marine has developed an innovative solution to this problem — a wave-driven desalination system (called Wave2O™) that can be deployed quickly, operate completely “off-grid” and supply large quantities of fresh water at competitive cost. A location for a pilot-scale Wave2O™ plant in Cape Verde has been secured and the site assessment studies, e.g. bathymetric surveys, wave energy assessment, and water quality assessment, started in Q2 2017 financed by the African Development Bank through a $1.0M SEFA (Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa) grant. During his presentation at the IHTC, Bill Staby will provide details of the Wave2O™ system and of the Cape Verde pilot project.},

  abstract={Software plays a critical role in our daily lives, providing automated support for various tasks in various domains. Behind many of the decisions that modern software makes is a data-driven infrastructure that attempts to create equitable, unbiased decisions. However, numerous examples exist of data-driven software perpetuating societal inequities and further marginalizing populations. How do we attend to software fairness? What are the best approaches for software engineers to be more conscious of the harmful impacts on the most vulnerable within our communities? Prior work recommends new tools to resolve the unfair and biased outcomes; however, the issue of biased inequitable software technology is an interdisciplinary problem that we can no longer solely depend on technical solutions. Instead, we need to incorporate interdisciplinary methods to help address the inequity of software technology. This position paper introduces reflexivity from the social science literature to motivate and encourage software engineers to integrate reflexive practices throughout the entirety of the software engineering process.},

  abstract={Almost every industry is facing a real risk of disruption from cutting-edge technologies. New technologies drive the Digital Transformation (DT), which induces significant changes in the business landscape. This reality forces companies to change and adapt their business models to remain competitive. While transforming digitally, companies also face the challenge of complying with sustainability aspects. There is a growing understanding by politicians, managers, investors, and scholars that it is not enough for companies to be concerned with short-term profits because natural disasters, social unrest, and economic inequality can affect long-term prosperity. This paper explores publications related to sustainable business models (SBM) and digital transformation (DT) to uncover common ground between the underlying concepts of sustainability and digitalization. A science mapping approach is applied to review Scopus indexed articles and conference papers related to SBM and DT. This paper aims to reveal the size, growth path, and geographic distribution of the knowledge base and trends in the common SBM and DT literature. It is the first attempt of a bibliometric review for this merged research field and shall guide practical implications and future research possibilities.},

The existing analysis and calculation of the leakage magnetic field and electromagnetic force generally use the finite element integration method to solve the dynamic modeling of the short circuit of the transformer. Secondly, the transformer short-circuit monitoring scheme based on the principle of transformer internal electromagnetic and winding vibration is described: low-voltage pulse method, short-circuit impedance method and frequency response method, and some emerging schemes derived from these three methods, which have high accuracy but are mostly offline monitoring. Finally, the concept of transformer online monitoring based on digital twin (DT) technology is proposed. The DT modeling and monitoring prediction of transformer are carried out by four core technologies of data acquisition, data management, model construction and DT platform constructed with IoT as the carrier of human-computer interaction.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={118660-118675},
  abstract={Crop insurance serves as a crucial risk mitigation strategy for farmers facing uncertainties stemming from unpredictable weather conditions and vulnerabilities within the agricultural production process. Unfortunately, the prevailing traditional methods of crop insurance are laden with complexities, high costs, and, more critically, a lack of trust, which has deterred farmers from safeguarding their crops. Addressing these challenges, we present an innovative blockchain-based crop index insurance solution aimed at delivering multiple benefits. Our solution leverages blockchain technology to ensure unprecedented transparency throughout the insurance ecosystem. Every transaction and data exchange among farmers, insurers, and weather data providers is recorded on an immutable ledger, fostering trust, accountability, and confidence among all stakeholders. Moreover, blockchain’s inherent immutability and the use of smart contracts mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities in the crop insurance domain. Claims are processed autonomously, significantly reducing the possibility of fraudulent claims and enhancing the integrity of the system. One of the primary concerns of farmers, delayed claim settlements, is addressed by our solution. Smart contracts enable automated and prompt claim processing, ensuring that farmers receive timely payouts. Furthermore, our solution substantially reduces costs by eliminating intermediaries and streamlining administrative processes. This affordability democratizes crop insurance, making it accessible to a broader spectrum of farmers, including those in low-income countries. Our comprehensive approach integrates advanced algorithms for secure information sharing and interaction among stakeholders. We have rigorously tested the smart contract code under diverse scenarios using the Remix IDE, with the code’s availability on GitHub as a reference. Security vulnerabilities have been meticulously assessed and addressed. Thus, our paper presents an effective, low-cost, and trustworthy solution utilizing blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate timely crop insurance for farmers. By enhancing transparency, reducing fraud, expediting claim processing, and increasing affordability, our solution aims to revolutionize crop insurance, making it more accessible and reliable for farmers worldwide.},

  abstract={The adoption of charging vehicles in Rajshahi has emerged as a significant step towards reducing air pollution and promoting a healthy, green city. However, the current centralized licensing system poses challenges such as time-consuming processes and the potential for fraudulent activities. To address these issues, this paper proposes the implementation of a secure and decentralized smart licensing system for charging vehicles in Rajshahi City Corporation, leveraging the smart capabilities of blockchain technology. By utilizing Hyperledger Fabric, the implementation generates blockchain based smart contracts that automate and streamline the licensing process smartly and efficiently. This approach ensures the immutability, transparency, and integrity of license records, minimizing the risk of fraud and enhancing overall efficiency. Additionally, the system incorporates the use of QR codes and an inquiry system to enhance the credibility of paper-based licenses. Compared to other digital licenses, this blockchain-based method significantly reduces risks and contributes to the development of a greener and more sustainable Rajshahi city environment. Furthermore, the introduction of a sustainable business policy, utilizing the G2C model, facilitates revenue generation and distribution fairly and equitably for all stakeholders involved in the charging vehicle ecosystem. This implementation not only offers cost benefits and efficiency improvements for drivers but also promotes a sustainable and environmentally friendly city.},

  number={},
  pages={109-116},
  abstract={Circular manufacturing represents a transformative approach to production and consumption, emphasizing resource conservation, waste reduction, and the creation of sustainable, closed-loop systems. It is clearly a competitive advantage and a market opportunity for manufacturers. However, implementing circular strategies and closed loop systems requires seamless flow and sharing of data across different stages of the product lifecycle from design to production, and End of Life. Therefore, disparate systems, incompatible data structures, and data silos present a challenge for the integration and harmonization of data from different sources for circular manufacturing. Additionally, the lack of system interoperability limits the ability to gain a holistic view of the circular manufacturing process, hindering effective decision-making and optimization. This research paper aims to investigate the nature of data sharing for circular manufacturing, focusing on the strategies employed and the pivotal role of sharing data between stakeholders within these strategies, from a product lifecycle perspective. A literature review is performed on the use of data from each lifecycle stage of the product for closed loop manufacturing, as well as the participation of the stakeholders within the circular manufacturing practices. The outcome of the review is a discussion on the collaboration opportunities available for manufacturing companies, focused on exchanging and sharing data, that will support the implementation of circular manufacturing. This work presents the role of each actor along the product lifecycle in supporting circular manufacturing activities data provider (passive engagement), data receiver, or implementer of circular activities (active engagement).},

  abstract={Recent work has recognized the importance of developing and deploying software systems that reflect human values and has explored different approaches for eliciting these values from stakeholders. However, prior studies have also shown that it can be challenging for stakeholders to specify a diverse set of product-related human values. In this paper we therefore explore the use of ChatGPT for generating user stories that describe candidate human values. These generated stories provide inspiration to stakeholder discussions and enrich the human-created user stories. We engineer a series of ChatGPT prompts to retrieve a list of common stakeholders and candidate features for a targeted product, and then, for each pairwise combination of role and feature, and for each individual Schwartz value, we issue an additional prompt to generate a candidate user story reflecting that value. We present the candidate user-stories to stakeholders and, as part of a creative requirements engineering session, we ask them to assess and prioritize the generated user-stories, and then use them as inspiration for discussing and specifying their own product-related human values. Through conducting a series of focus groups we compare the human-values created by stakeholders with and without the benefit of the ChatGPT examples. Results are evaluated with respect to coverage of values, clarity of expression, internal completeness, and through feedback from our participants. Results from our analysis show that the ChatGPT-generated user stories are able to provide creativity triggers that help stakeholders to specify human values for a product.},

  abstract={In the modern world, the concept of the green supply chain is applied to introduce sustainable development and integrate it into production and operational management. Green standards and principles have sparked the interest of managers and professionals in selecting innovative practices for suppliers and organizations. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices (reverse logistics, eco-design, green purchasing, internal environmental management, investment recovery, cooperation with customers, and green manufacturing) on the organizational performance of the Sri Lankan hotel industry. The empirical evidence verifies that adopting GSCM practices has a substantial positive impact on overall organizational performance. The study provided valuable insights into the types of GSCM practices that firms should adopt to enhance organizational performance. Moreover, this current study contributed to advancing the comprehension of the impact of GSCM practices on organizational performance. This review has the potential limitation of focusing only on the hotel industry within the service sector.},

  abstract={The Strategic Management literature has been for a long time bringing the issue of Complexity to its agenda and pointing to the need for organizations to develop their Adaptive Capacity. However, the design of a management model for the strategic management of established organizations, so as to replace the traditional strategic management model - the one associated with strategic planning and the follow up and correction framework - still needs to be the object of systematic Research & Development efforts in the field of Management Science and Engineering. This paper presents an approach in the context of such a Design Science Development effort, where the first redesign process, carried out in partnership with the organization where the practices are to be implemented (i.e. a core-design), is described, and its results analyzed. It presents a real-world solution for how the traditional model of strategic management can be overcome dialectically - when the initial design proposition is preserved, denied and exceeded at the same time, by the adoption of new management practices within and complementary to the standard model as adopted by the organization.},

  abstract={Water supply system is an infrastructure for collection, storage, transmission, and distribution of water to homes, factories, irrigation of agricultural fields, etc. Water holds an important factor in growth of the city. Earlier, lakes and rivers are the major source of water supply to the cities and villages. The rivers followed their own path throughout the city and provided water to some specific areas. Due to this the new areas which were being developed would not have direct connection to the new areas, the people would have to look for other alternatives or use the water available from the underground water beds, by building wells. Water connection to different regions is setup in an organized manner. Even though everything is organized, but there are certain drawbacks such as improper detection in the leakage of pipe lines and failure in the proper use of technology to setup and organize.In this paper, an attempt has been made to rectify these problems by applying the concept of binary search tree. Also, we have discussed about how pipelines can be setup underground in a smooth manner and using IOT devices to detect leakages or breakages in the pipelines, so that the water is not wasted.},

  abstract={Many organisations are engaged in Enterprise architecture (EA) practice to align business and technology requirements as they transition towards a desirable future state. Previous conceptual studies indicate that leveraging enablers and overcoming blockers within EA practice lead to improved business-IT alignment, resulting in improved services. However, there is a limited body of literature that offers empirical validation of each enabler and blocker in practice identified. Therefore, this study aims to investigate key EA practice enablers and blockers to achieving business-IT alignment experienced by architects. Based on the interviews with 19 architects from 13 organisations, our study revealed five key enablers, as well as five critical blockers relating to business strategy, organisational structures, business and IT relationship, data and information use, and technology. Our study findings offer important implications for research and practice in business improvement endeavours.},

  abstract={Identifying anomalies in millions of stars in real time is a great challenge. In this paper, we develop a matched filtering based algorithm to detect a typical anomaly, microlensing. The algorithm can detect short timescale microlensing events with high accuracy at their early stage with a very low false-positive rate. Furthermore, a GPU accelerated scalable computational framework, which can enable real time follow-up observation, is designed. This framework efficiently divides the algorithm between CPU and GPU, accelerating large scale light curve processing to meet low latency requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed method can process 200,000 stars (the maximum number of stars processed by a single GWAC telescope) in approximately 3.34 seconds with current commodity hardware while achieving an accuracy of 92% and an average detection occurring approximately 14% before the peak of the anomaly with zero false alarm. Working together with the proposed sharding mechanism, the framework is positioned to be extendable to multiple GPUs to improve the performance further for the higher data throughput requirements of next-generation telescopes.},

  abstract={The aim of technical education is to design a career-based curriculum that imparts a set of skills to students and enable them to contribute to a nation's economic progress. With their multifarious uses, information systems (IS) lie at the heart of modern economies. IS curricula offer several tracks for students to pursue career paths based on their interests and opportunities. To offer students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they glean from classroom instructions on real-world problems, capstone projects are essential elements in most, if not all, IS programs. As IS programs increasingly offer a wider range of career paths for students, the design and delivery of such capstone projects present a set of unique challenges. In this paper, we examine the set of challenges and share our experience from designing and delivering a career track-based capstone course for the first time at a large university. Feedback from students and faculty supervisors indicates that the course was able to meet its learning objectives to a notable extent and offered important pointers to future improvements in the course design.},

  abstract={Humanitarian response often addresses the basic human needs which include safe, sanitary, hazard free environment. From the war torn countries to remote communities, untreated household waste water creates living conditions directly affecting human welfare. We present an IoT enabled, semi-industrial, mobile waste water treatment solution targeted for communities in remote sub-Arctic regions without a centralized sewer system or a waste water treatment facility. The open-source hardware and software platforms were implemented on an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to operate a household water reuse system. The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few.},

  pages={213-218},
  abstract={Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing agriculture as we must produce food to feed a growing global population. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the world population is expected to be 9.2 billion by 2050, and consequently the food demand will be increased by 70%. To cope with these increasing demands, the food production also needs to increase by at least 50–70 % to its current capacity by 2050. Improving production efficiency on farms and minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an ongoing and active research area. The article is a work-in-progress presentation of our ongoing efforts in the direction of building an all-encompassing framework towards less GHG intensive climate-neutral farming practices. The dairy sector within agriculture is being used for validation and experimentation, with cows as the centrepiece, and the farmers as the stakeholders that will be the ultimate actors for sustainable environmental impact from the improved farming practices in place. The work also focuses on measuring the behavioural changes of farmer(s) for adoption of technology. The envisioned end goal is to build an overarching toolkit and framework for effective knowledge sharing. The article starts with a brief contextual introduction, followed by key considerations, challenges and identified research questions that need to be addressed and evaluated at a wider level in the research community to build the desired framework at a global scale.},

  abstract={Introduction: While usability/user experience (UX) has a long and intertwined history with technical and professional communication (TPC), it is unknown how usability/UX is reflected within TPC research and how that reflection has shifted over time. Literature review: Prior studies on the role of usability/UX in TPC have found that usability/UX appears infrequently in TPC research and curriculum requirements. However, usability/UX remains a routinely referenced core identity of TPC. Research questions: 1. To what degree is usability/UX studied in TPC scholarly journals? 2. When TPC researchers study usability/UX, what are they studying? Methodology: A database of TPC-based usability/UX articles was collected through a defined search method. Articles were coded for primary or secondary emphasis on usability/UX, contribution to TPC, object of analysis, method of data collection, and major takeaway. Results: Less than 8% of the total publications in the field are tied to usability/UX, though the percentage has increased in the most recent timeframe (2020–2022). Publications are shifting from research that expands usability/UX knowledge to research that uses usability/UX to explain TPC phenomena. In addition, the object of analysis has shifted to process-centric analysis, design thinking has become an increasing component of TPC usability/UX research, and over a quarter of the research on usability/UX provided did not provide enough methodological description to enable replicability. Conclusion: Although usability/UX has been consistently published in the TPC research journals, the amount of research suggests that usability/UX is not core to TPC's field identity.},

  abstract={Algorithmic composition methods must prove themselves within real-world musical contexts to more firmly solidify their adoption in musical practice. The present project is an automatic composing program trained on a corpus of songs from musical theater to create novel material, directly generating a scored lead sheet of vocal melody and chords. The program can also produce output based upon phonetic analysis of user-provided lyrics. The chance to undertake the research arose from a television documentary funded by Sky Arts that considered the question of whether current-generation, computationally creative methods could devise a new work of musical theater (the research described here provides but one strand within that project). Allied with the documentary, the resultant musical had a two-week West End run in London and was itself broadcast in full. Evaluation of the project included both design feedback from a musical theater composer team, and critical feedback from audiences and media coverage. The research challenges of the real-world context are discussed, with respect to the compromises necessary to get such a project to the stage.},

  abstract={The opinion that technology can dispiace a person to a different environment without any physical movement and create the illusion of interaction with the artificial environment is not new. Engineers and scientists have been dedicating their efforts to its progressive development over the last sixty years. However, most of the technological advances have been made in the last twenty years, At present, virtual reality is completely applied in different fields, such as robotics telemedicine, or cinematography. Following on from this success, the question arises of whether we have plan to apply it to industrial design and manufacturing processes. Rapid evolution of this technology applied to CAD/CAM over the last twenty years, together with the lack of recent reviews on it, have been the basic motivations to develop this study.},

M. Kotsiopoulos (main advisor), and assistant professors D. Papalexopoulos and S. Zafiropoulos (advisory committee). A transformation in the notion of virtual space is observed: from its conception as an autonomous reality to the merged reality of physical-digital. The conception of virtual space as cyberspace is crucial as it augmented the experience of physical space offering a new potential. A new syntax of space emerges from digital space. Focussing on specific studies of form generating mechanisms in digital space, it is presented that they have strong relations with Chomsky's theory of generative grammar and with Hillier's approach for the genotypic form of space. In the context of an augmented syntax of digital space through generative processes, it is shown that the notion of virtual is the filter between the field of possibility of the digital and the actuality of physical space},

  pages={1142-1158},
  abstract={The substantial growth of Internet-of-Things technology and the ubiquity of smartphone devices has increased the public and industry focus on speech emotion recognition (SER) technologies. Yet, conceptual, technical, and societal challenges restrict the wide adoption of these technologies in various domains, including, healthcare, and education. These challenges are amplified when automated emotion recognition systems are called to function “in-the-wild” due to the inherent complexity and subjectivity of human emotion, the difficulty of obtaining reliable labels at high temporal resolution, and the diverse contextual and environmental factors that confound the expression of emotion in real life. In addition, societal and ethical challenges hamper the wide acceptance and adoption of these technologies, with the public raising questions about user privacy, fairness, and explainability. This article briefly reviews the history of affective speech processing, provides an overview of current state-of-the-art approaches to SER, and discusses algorithmic approaches to render these technologies accessible to all, maximizing their benefits and leading to responsible human-centered computing applications.},

  abstract={Civic technologies are aimed at supporting citizens to participate in democratic processes. Civic robots - social robots that are designed to support people in civic participation - have potential to lower the barriers of participation especially for youth who face obstacles in participating through formal channels. We conducted an exploratory study with adolescents to investigate their perceptions of possible roles for civic robots. In the study, we asked participants of a youth event ($\mathrm{n}=24$, age range 14–21) to ideate civic participation related purposes and concepts for social robots. The findings suggest that scenarios in which a robot serves as social facilitator or provides decision support for civic activities seem promising. In addition, civic robots could indirectly increase participation ability by providing emotional or social support.},

  abstract={People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) often have a sedentary lifestyle that can lead to long-term issues like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and depression. Few games and apps promoting physical activity for people with IDs exist, and they do not have a focus on the motivational aspect. This paper aims to find how to develop software that can motivate people with IDs to do physical activity outdoors. For this purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not attract much of the users' attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities.},

  abstract={This study explores the safety challenges associated with the use of dynamic Systems-of-Systems, specifically dynamic Smart Ecosystem (dSES), in natural disaster management, with a focus on flood management. dSES is a complex network of multiple System of Systems (SoS) that interact dynamically to achieve a goal that none of the individual SoS can accomplish alone. Despite the potential benefits of dSES in natural disaster management, their dynamic behavior also poses significant safety challenges due to dynamic interactions that may appear normal but can lead to hazardous situations. Through theoretical analysis of an example of flood management, this paper addresses these challenges and emphasizes the importance of understanding system characteristics to ensure safety. Moreover, it highlights the significance of conducting a thorough assessment of the entire system at various hierarchical levels, taking into account the interdependencies within and among levels, encompassing intra-level, inter-level, and operational aspects, along with technical, organizational, and socio-technical safety complexities.},

  abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) promises to enhance everyday objects with computing, but rarely enables directly authoring or composing that behavior. Lightweight IoT approaches attach identifiers (e.g., RFID tags) to objects to enable networked services. Typically these tags are passive, and so, depend on activity recognition and predefined context. This limits interaction to invoking predetermined behavior. Instead, this work presents The IoT Codex: a lightweight approach to customizing everyday objects with IoT by enabling interactive attachable IDs (aIDs) to compose software-supported behavior in situ. This work contributes 1) paper engineering techniques to construct aIDs that embody state, and 2) a tangible, end user programming (EUP) language for customizing IoT within symbolic and idiosyncratic contexts. Here, we provide preliminary validation of our approach with an empirically informed design space, sample applications, and a small co-design workshop. In doing so, we offer preliminary evidence for tangible, end user programming to enable meaningful control over IoT services.},

A multi-agent-based network manufacturing ASP (Application Service Provider) platform has so many advantages on resources, efficiency and cost, so it is an important way to promote the informationization of small and medium-sized enterprises. A detailed working flowchart model based on MAS (Multi-Agent System) theory is established in the paper. The resource management subsystem of the network manufacturing ASP system is based on multi-agent. Agents have been divided and formally described and the internal structure, the behavior method, the active flow, the communication language as well as the management pattern of the agent has been studied. Each agent can communicate and collaborate with the others, so that the system exhibits certain intelligence in resource choice and decision-making.

  abstract={Coordination refers to agents that coordinate their own behavior in an environment of finite resources to conform to individual benefits or group goals. Dependent agents use effective information connections for coordinating and adjusting resource distribution, thereby reaching agreements between dependent agents. However, during the process of coordination, an effective method of assessment is necessary for information linkage. This research proposes an effective method for assessing the design of the coordination of autonomous agents, which can be applied to urban outdoor space design based on the developed "good place" model base. The purpose of this research is to assess the coordination effectiveness of coordination agents during the interaction process of the design model via numerical analysis. This project adopts autonomous coordination agents to simulate the design goal, constructs a coordination model, and defines the coordination collections of agent groups, and regards the conflicts in the coordination process as the coordination problems of agents in each group.},

  abstract={As a means of making elections more accessible and more convenient for voters, the use of online voting systems has grown in recent years. However, maintaining these systems' accuracy and security remains a significant obstacle. A face-and-email OTP-based voting system based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methodology is proposed in this study to address these issues. Facial recognition and email OTP verification are used to verify a voter's identity and capture their face for the system. A CNN model that has been trained on a database of faces belonging to registered voters is used to perform the facial recognition process. After their identification has been confirmed, the voter may utilize the technology to cast their ballot. An additional layer of security and protection against potential fraud or hacking is provided by the combination of email OTP verification and facial recognition. In addition, the privacy and accuracy of the voting process are guaranteed by making use of a secure database and a user-friendly interface. The legal and ethical ramifications of incorporating facial recognition technology into a voting system, including privacy concerns and the possibility of algorithmic bias, must be taken into account during system design and implementation. A face-and-email OTP-based voting system based on CNN methodology provides an effective and secure option for online voting while preserving voter privacy and accuracy.},

  abstract={Increasing usage of mechatronics systems into different applications such as manufacturing system, home appliances with IoT, digital twin and many more, demands an efficient product development method for mechatronics products. As agile product development is known for its efficiency and flexibility in the software industry, research to implement the same approach in the mechatronics industry was more than a necessity. This research unveils the views on the mechatronics product development methods with the help of semi-structured interviews and survey. It explains the use of agile methods as per the need of the industry and in the context of mechatronics product development. Many important aspects have been surfaced such as important phases of mechatronics product development for use of agile method along with involvement of different stakeholders, its benefits, pain points while using agile method and a need of incorporating virtual prototyping into the process. With these results, conceptualization of a hybrid approach could proceed in the right direction.},

  abstract={In this concept paper, we advocate for a paradigm shift in computational modeling. Advanced modeling should conceive new computational languages and models to describe real-life phenomena and solve real-life problems. Moreover, it should also be used to create "negotiated realities". A negotiated reality is an operating environment that situates within the reality-virtuality continuum. To model an environment, both the modeler and the users of the model are required: (i) to use a formal language for describing and explaining the functions and behaviors of a phenomenon and its environment, and (ii) to use the power of information technologies to search and experiment with new environments that would best address the problem at hand. We suggest an integrative formal language that includes an unbounded set of formal sublanguages to support the modeling of cognitive and reasoning situations, and an agent-based carrier sublanguage to offer the infrastructure required to support interactions in the virtual environment.},

  abstract={The sharing economy, which is based on the exchange, sale, donation or rental of products and services among strangers, raises questions about the security, privacy and motivations of users regarding interpersonal trust and platforms. In this context, this study aims to analyze the scientific production about the thematic trust in the sharing economy through bibliometric techniques. For this purpose, a search of the Scopus platform was carried out, which initially resulted in 145 publications, in later phases these studies were selected and analyzed with the aid of software. The bibliometric analysis allowed us to explore the literature about trust in the sharing economy between the years 2013 to 2018. The findings were categorized into annual publication of articles, origin and quantity of publications, methodological nature, instruments and techniques of data collection, association between authors by affiliation countries, occurrence of keywords and referenced authors to conceptualize the sharing economy. By considering the sharing economy a recent and changing subject, this mapping elucidates the advancement of publications and identifies the current research scenario. For future studies, it is suggested to analyze the various platforms based on topics such as familiarity, perceived risk, security, privacy and interaction and design in the digital platforms of the sharing economy.},

  abstract={During the last decades, the construction sector has had lower productivity rates than other industries. This low productivity has been the starting point for implementing new methodologies to generate added value in construction. One of the most relevant movements has been that of digital transformation. However, technologies alone will not generate a competitive advantage for organizations; such implementations must be carried out together with changes in the organizational structure. In this way, the main objective of this research is to analyze the theoretical relationship between digital transformation and organizational structures. These links could significantly impact improving the products and services provided by the construction sector. The main results show that the organizational climate, the exchange of information, and the integrated organizational innovation are the main result variables for improving products and services in the sector. Finally, an implementation framework of digital transformation and the organizational structure seems to improve organizational results.},

  abstract={Improving the performance of processors is one of the main tasks of high-performance processor design. It is an effective way to improve the processor's performance through high-speed inter-chip interconnection, which utilizes multiple chips to build one unified computing system with higher performance. The existing multi-chip interconnection technologies, such as CCIX, CXL and NVLink, are faced with the problems of not open protocol, high hardware overhead and difficulty to reuse with existing high-speed peripherals. Considering the limitation of current multi-chip interconnection, we adopt the network centered idea to design FT_Link open architecture, which realizes the interconnection of multiple chips in a low-cost way and enables requests to access other chip spaces transparently. FT_Link system is built on common logic layer and physical layer of the existing high-speed peripherals, making it flexible and versatile. Tests and synthesis results show that FT_ Link technology has the feature of high throughput and low latency with very small hardware overhead. Its performance bottleneck depends on the FIFO depth of the high-speed peripheral logical layer which it adopts.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Building energy optimization offers an impactful and readily addressable opportunity for reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings. Owners/operators of commercial properties (building operators) have recognized this opportunity and invested significantly in both energy management devices (such as sensors and controllers) and systems (such as Building Management Systems, BMS) to be master-controllers for these installed devices. Recent studies have revealed that an additional 10% energy savings opportunity would become available if building operators can sustain optimal BMS configurations. Unfortunately, at least three significant challenges limit ongoing BMS configuration optimization. First, most BMSs have vendor-specific interfaces that require custom, one-off integrations for remote access. Second, a lack of consistency in how building configurations and performance data is represented from one BMS to another, makes it hard to aggregate performance trends. Third, BMSs often support single users, i.e., building operators, impeding the ability to support for multi-stakeholder applications such as for personalizing occupant experiences and planning disaster evacuations. We propose a hybrid cloud/on-premise model that reuses existing BMS implementations but incorporates the benefits of new cloud technologies. Our model employs a cloud-based “middle layer” infrastructure (which we call GeoBMS) that connects on-premise BMSs to scalable building management applications. The hybrid model addresses each of the identified BMS limitations: remote inaccessibility through virtualization; inconsistent data representation through unified cloud data models; and lack of multi-stakeholder access through global authentication. GeoBMS offers published APIs for applications to access virtualized infrastructure capabilities. We present a proof-of-concept application (which we call EnergyOptimize) that uses GeoBMS to monitor energy performance and optimize building configurations. We illustrate the application using a museum case-example.},

This paper presents a comparative analysis of policy, legislation and practice related to e-participation globally, and with a specific emphasis on South Africa. Our analysis reveals three distinctive features of the current e-participation governance landscape, all of which are broadly centred on a rights-based approach. Firstly, e-participation is a complement to in-person participation and should be targeted at the inclusion of people that are not normally involved in decision-making. Second, e-participation should be embedded within a wider digital rights framework which recognises possible inequities and harms resulting from the use of technology. Finally, public officials need to develop capabilities and processes for engaging with civic-led policy deliberations that take place outside of their direct control.},

  pages={23-32},
  abstract={The growing population of cognitively impaired individuals calls for the emergence of a research area dedicated to developing computing systems that address their needs. The nature of this research area requires to bridge the many disciplines needed to develop human-centered, assistive computing systems. Such bridging may seem unattainable considering the conceptual and practical gaps between the related disciplines and the challenges of propagating human-related concerns throughout the many stages of the development process of assistive technologies. As a consequence, existing assistive technologies lack a proper needs analysis; their development is often driven by technology concerns, resulting in ill-designed and stereotype-biased systems; and, most of them are not tested for their effectiveness in assisting users. In this paper, we propose a systematic exploration of this vast challenge. First, we define Assistive Computing as a research area and propose key principles to drive its study. Then, we introduce a tool-based methodology dedicated to developing assistive computing support, integrating a range of disciplines from human-related sciences to computer science. This methodology is purposefully pragmatic in that it leverages, aggregates and revisits numerous research results, concretizing it with a range of examples. More generally, our goal is i) to provide a framework to conduct research in the area of Assistive Computing and ii) to identify the necessary bridges between disciplines to account for all the dimensions of such systems.},

Through a collaborative project aiming at a prototype VR gathering place for Indigenous communities, we investigate the needs and concerns of community members and propose a framework consisting of a new information system model and its design process. We refer to this framework as Indigenous Technology Empowerment Model (ITEM), which is implemented using a hierarchical community involvement approach and elements we call Participatory Action Unit (PAU). Our prototype development follows this framework, and a qualitative analysis of community participation shows the initial success of our approach in empowering the communities to play an active role in the design process and identify the important technical features to be worked on. Our research also identifies proper community training as an essential component of a community-based design process.},

  abstract={As the use and impact of autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) become pervasive, we need to establish societal and policy guidelines in order for such systems to remain human-centric, serving humanity’s values and ethical principles. These systems must be developed and should operate in a way that is beneficial to people and the environment, beyond simply reaching functional goals and addressing technical problems. This approach will foster the heightened level of trust between people and technology that is needed for its fruitful use in our daily lives.},

  abstract={The objective of this paper is to report on the development of prototype models for use in raising public awareness of changes in rural areas, focusing on green spaces, and testing responses to scenarios of change. Specifically, the focus is on the design of appropriate types and speeds of movement of features. This modelling is done using the Maya and ArcGIS software packages together in a novel combination of spatial and visualisation tools. The experiment results show evidence that different types of animation with interactive communication will influence participation and decision making in land use planning.},

  abstract={As non-functional properties of composite software services involve a good deal of uncertainty, we consider them as shared goals for an agent team. An architect is focused on choosing each service and its provider, while the consultant will suggest, when help is possible, an alternative so that the likelihood of success is maximized. We employ a structure called”Belief Recipe Tree” for supporting this kind of decisions and build the necessary beliefs starting from a set of prior experiences the consultant has had with different provider and/or abstract plans. This approach is shown to provide a higher flexibility due to the fact that beliefs are revised after each experience.},

  abstract={As an advanced manufacturing form, collaborative manufacturing meets the needs of efficient production. With the development of production technology and increasingly complex market demand, manufacturing enterprises need to make more flexible production plans and resource utilization programs to cope with this change. We build a new smart fuzzy system and use it in the distributed manufacturing network of an enterprise to enhance the collaborative manufacturing capability within the network to help manufacturing enterprises create more economic benefits with limited production resources. This smart fuzzy system combines the arithmetical intuitionistic fuzzy generalized λ-Shapley Choquet (AIFGSCgλ) operator to consider the relationship between index factors, firstly, a multi-objective robust optimization model is constructed by the manufacturing enterprise according to its own equipment requirements and solved by the NSGA-II-MOPSO algorithm. Secondly, combined with the AIFGSCgλ operator to select the optimal equipment transfer scheme and achieve dynamic equipment resource allocation combined with practical cases to illustrate that this new smart fuzzy system will help manufacturing enterprises to make better use of existing manufacturing resources and reduce unnecessary capacity waste. It helps enterprises to establish equipment transfer plan and production planning plan more quickly and easily; it verifies the practicality and effectiveness of this new smart fuzzy system applied in manufacturing enterprises.},

  abstract={This paper designs and implements a dedicated microprocessor architecture based on the RISC-V (the fifth-generation Reduced Instruction Set Computing) with only 20 instructions for arbitrary-point FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm. Moreover, the corresponding SoC (System-on-Chip) is also built for the expansibility and reconfigurability. The methodology of software and hardware co-verification is applied to validate the correctness of the systematic functions by comparing the simulation results between MATLAB, Visual Studio 2019 and VIVADO 2019.1. Finally, the Xilinx Artix-7 (XC7A100TFGG484-2) FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform is used for implementation and prototyping of the proposed hardware system, which totally uses 1897 LUTs (Look-Up Tables), 361 FFs (Flip-Flops) and 25 BRAMs (Block Random Access Memory) and consumes 2.016W at 100MHz. The experimental results show that the presented system can realize the FFT algorithm at any point by reconfiguring the parameters of software and expanding the capacity of the memory, and it is suitable for the embedded applications due to the small area and low power consumption.},
