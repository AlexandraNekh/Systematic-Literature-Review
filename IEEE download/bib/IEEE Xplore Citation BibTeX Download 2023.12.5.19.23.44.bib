  abstract={Successful, enjoyable group interactions are important in public and personal contexts, especially for teenagers whose peer groups are important for self-identity and self-esteem. Social robots seemingly have the potential to positively shape group interactions, but it seems difficult to effect such impact by designing robot behaviors solely based on related (human interaction) literature. In this article, we take a user-centered approach to explore how teenagers envisage a social robot "group assistant". We engaged 16 teenagers in focus groups, interviews, and robot testing to capture their views and reflections about robots for groups. Over the course of a two-week summer school, participants co-designed the action space for such a robot and experienced working with/wizarding it for 10+ hours. This experience further altered and deepened their insights into using robots as group assistants. We report results regarding teenagers’ views on the applicability and use of a robot group assistant, how these expectations evolved throughout the study, and their repeat interactions with the robot. Our results indicate that each group moves on a spectrum of need for the robot, reflected in use of the robot more (or less) for ice-breaking, turn-taking, and fun-making as the situation demanded.},

  abstract={Many museums have begun to pay attention to the application of the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique for protecting and displaying the cultural heritage. This is because it can demonstrate the 3D shape of the relics with high precision and from multiple angles. However, a survey in China indicated that most museums only use this technique as an auxiliary display, and have not fully utilize interactive techniques to exert the benefits of digital 3D simulation. Based on the theory of narratology, this study proposed a narrative conceptual framework with 12 elements by analyzing the narratological features of 3D reconstructed cultural relics, and used this narratological framework to plan and complete a 3D interactive design. Thus narratology was used as a design thinking of interactive design, changing the technology-oriented thinking habitually used in digital design. And the narrative mode of 3D interaction was also enriched through this study.},

  pages={69-78},
  abstract={Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is an essential hardware component in SDN-enabled switches, which supports fast lookup speed and flexible matching patterns. However, TCAM’s limited storage capacity has long been a scalability challenge to enforce fine-grained forwarding policies in SDN. Based on the observation of traffic locality, the rule-caching mechanism employs a combination of TCAM and Random Access Memory (RAM) to maintain the forwarding rules of large and small flows, respectively. However, previous works cannot identify large flows timely and accurately, and suffer from high computational complexity when addressing rule dependencies in TCAM. Worse still, TCAM only caches the forwarding rules of large flows but ignores the latency requirements of small flows. Small flows encounter cache-miss in TCAM and then will be diverted to RAM, where they have to experience slow lookup processes. To jointly optimize the performance of both high-throughput large flows and latency-sensitive small flows, we propose a hybrid rule-caching framework, H-Cache, to scale traffic-aware forwarding policies in SDN. H-Cache identifies large flows through a collaboration of learning-based and threshold-based methods to achieve early detection and high accuracy, and proposes a time-efficient greedy heuristic to address rule dependencies. For small flows, H-Cache establishes default paths in TCAM to speed up their lookup processes, and also reduces their TCAM occupancy through label switching and region partitioning. Experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that H-Cache increases TCAM utilization by an average of 11% and reduces the average completion time of small flows by almost 70%.},

  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to increase the productivity of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in developing countries has long been recognized. However, the realization of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavored to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SOEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SOEs listed under Privatization Commission is still in its infancy. It also identifies some significant barriers which are impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SOEs, and confidence on ICT of the SOEs in Bangladesh. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project and explores the opportunities and barriers of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SOEs in Bangladesh.},

  pages={243-250},
  abstract={Risk management could be seen as one of the important knowledge areas in the project management field that affects all the other areas in the project and also affect the success of the project as whole. In the recent years, Information Technology (IT) projects have become more complex as a result of the technological changes and the demand of having easy and flexible products, so it is important to give more focus to how the IT projects are managed. This research study aimed to study the link between implementing the project risk management activities and the success of the IT project in IT and Telecommunication sectors in Egypt. The success of the IT projects was measured using four dimensions: project time management (schedule), project cost management, project scope management and project quality management. The risk management activities contain the following: plan risk management, identify risks, perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk response, implement risk response, monitor risk. In order to achieve the objectives of this research, questionnaire was developed as a main instrument to collect the primary data. The questionnaire consisted of the following parts: the first part relates to background information; the second part relates to the project risk management and the third section relates to the project success. This study targeted the employees of IT project in Egypt, and 103 questionnaires were distributed to the study sample, and then SPSS was used to analyze the collected data. The results of this research showed that there is a positive impact for performing risk management activities on the IT project success and illustrate that implementing the risk management activities affect in a positive way the project success, and risk management should be considered as a one of the key activities that should be implemented in IT project and also should be considered as a one of the key factors that contribute to the IT project success.},

  abstract={Project implementation failures are often seen due to sustainable development problems. Developing countries suffer in terms of successful development projects due to a lack of transparency, poor information communication management, and many more that lead to poor project management. Blockchain applications aim to develop ecosystems that satisfy the high-security requirements of the users in enterprises such as finance, supply chain, and insurance which are more complex than the project management domain. This research reviewed several blockchain-based applications to fill this gap and identify the potential areas of blockchain systems in the project management field. Therefore, this paper first reviews the state-of-the-art blockchain use cases in project management to investigate the current status of blockchain applications in the domain of project management. Then presents an architecture based on the review results to guide researchers and developers in designing blockchain-based applications which are unique for the project management domain. The review reveals that blockchain technology has a wide range of unique functionalities and capabilities that contribute management of projects. This systematic review unveils the directions to new blockchain research in the domain of project management.},

  pages={72070-72087},
  abstract={Serious Games are games that aid in the process of training or learning content and skills. Numerous studies have reported the positive impact of serious games on the learning process for individuals with autism. However, many of these games do not utilize techniques known to be effective when teaching this specific audience, such as those based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers. Additionally, the GDD model provides characteristics that enable quantitative analysis of learning outcomes.},

  abstract={While efficient email triage is a well-known problem, the currently used email filtering solutions are still rudimentary and machine centric. Most filtering solutions work best if humans add machine interpretable keywords to the subject line of emails. More natural filtering options, such as project membership lists or content-based filtering, are very time consuming to set up and maintain. Especially in research ecosystems, significant fluctuation in team members, organisations and projects themselves is common. Research projects are also usually managed in an ad-hoc manner, making static filtering rules a sub-optimal solution. In this paper we therefore introduce the Mind Mesh paradigm, a novel human-friendly information management approach. Based on a self-describing graph structure, organisational structures, projects, and collaborations are modelled. Leveraging this information, the system can automate and support administrative processes such as email filtering, based on an understanding of the project structures. It relieves users of the necessity to maintain machine interpretable rules by hand and adapts to new situations by itself.},

  abstract={To meet stakeholder non-technical background, requirements are often presented by analysts in terms of scenarios. While translating requirements into scenarios, details and over-specifications (called Ahab's Legs) need to be added to make requirements concrete and understandable to stakeholders. Despite the expected benefits that they should convey, Ahab's Legs could disturb the requirement validation session. They can, in fact, distract the attention of stakeholders. Valuable discussion time may be wasted when focusing on irrelevant details rather than on the actually relevant ones. In the present paper, we address the Ahab's Leg dilemma and its potential impact on requirement validation sessions. We discuss how to measure the distraction due to Ahab's Legs and what are the possible approaches an analyst can adopt to limit it. Moreover, we present the design of a controlled experiment devoted to measure the impact of Ahab's Legs on requirement validation sessions. In particular, the experiment is meant to (1) estimate the magnitude of the distracting effect, and to (2) assess one of the most promising way to alleviate their negative effect, i.e. by making stakeholder aware of the Ahab's Legs before the validation session.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={592-597},
  abstract={Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction that occurs from exposure to an allergen. There has been an upward trend in the rates of hospitalization and Emergency Department (ED) visits related to anaphylaxis across the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Although fatal anaphylaxis is not a common occurrence, delays in treatment are nearly always associated with fatalities. Therefore, time is one of the leading variables related to successful outcomes associated with anaphylaxis treatment during prehospital care. Perhaps even more importantly, prehospital care faces a shortage of certified professionals. Some programs offer accelerated timelines to credential students faster than usual to make up for demand. In rural portions of the United States, paramedics and EMTs are leaving the field at alarming rates, causing significant changes in staffing and workload. The changes we are currently facing in the healthcare industry result in an unprecedented need for efficient, effective, and low-cost training solutions to prepare healthcare professionals and train community members to provide support before the arrival of EMS personnel. Emerging technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) have been identified as a potential way to train timely care. Still, they have not been fully evaluated from a human performance perspective. This work aims to clearly identify how VR can enhance training through a review of the extant literature. By mapping areas where 3D user interfaces (3DUIs) could be leveraged for training for encounters with a patient suffering from anaphylaxis, this paper demonstrates the practical use of VR/AR for training anaphylaxis response in community-based care settings.},

  abstract={This study investigates and critically assesses the reported pedagogical strategies for teaching sustainability in business schools and looks into Modern Responsible Management Education (MRME) evolving as a central part of business education curricula, mainly supported by digital teaching tools and virtual reality. The study utilizes the ‘‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses’’ (PRISMA) framework to answer the following two research questions: (1) What are the state-of-the-art practices in business schools in terms of sustainability? (2) What digital tools are most commonly used to support sustainability-related learning concepts? Data was curated from the Web of Science Core Collection databases from the last five years. The initial search keywords included ‘‘Sustainability’’ + ‘‘Business Education’’ +$\prime\prime Technolog \mathrm{y}$” and yielded 1,477 scholarly works. However, after the PRISMA technique was employed, 286 scholarly sources were identified as eligible for the scope of the study. The findings highlight three main critical points: (1) gamitication techniques can enhance student learning outcomes in sustainability and, in particular, critical thinking; (2) e-platforms and other digital tools can support students’ sustainabilityrelated skills development while emphasizing the importance of sustainability; and (3) e-platforms and virtual pedagogical tools can generate a collaborative and integrated learning environment leading to community-centric mindset. Furthermore, the literature indicated that sustainability-related courses raised awareness of various socio-economic factions and changes in industrial structures toward environmentally friendly organizations and led to betterjob prospects.},

  abstract={In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating m-Health technology into the occupational therapists' established recovery processes. Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.},

We hold a series of interviews with environmental scientists involved in developing and deploying computer based environmental models about the approach taken in engineering models, and describe a case study in deploying an environmental model (WRF: Weather Research & Forecasting) on a cloud architecture. From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment. Together, we propose they will allow scientists to concentrate on fundamental science rather than specifics of the underlying computing.},

  abstract={Exploiting inter-iteration data-level parallelism (DLP) is the important focus of many loop accelerators. Target at this, we propose a loop parallelization acceleration framework LoopPara, which follows a hardware/software coordinated pipeline: 1) an offline parallelism analysis is used to extract and encode application behavioral semantic of loop instructions as configuration. 2) a specialized loop accelerator loads the configuration for hardware mapping and guide the loop parallelism execution. Unlike traditional loop accelerators, LoopPara does not need instruction set architecture (ISA) extension, compiler modification, and software kernel replacement, which has better platform portability and can be easily integrated with general- propose processors with any ISA. Experiments show that, when coupling to an in-order RISC-V Rocket core, the LoopPara achieves 2.31x-5.42x (4. 17x on average) speedups, which out- performs other high-performance out-of-order BOOM cores.},

  abstract={Extreme weather events, such as windstorms, hurricanes, and heat waves, exert a significant impact on global natural catastrophes and pose substantial challenges for weather forecasting systems. To enhance the accuracy and preparedness for extreme weather events, this study explores the potential of using expert crowdsourcing in storm forecasting research through the application of stigmergic collaboration. We present the development and implementation of an expert Crowdsourcing for Semantic Annotation of Atmospheric Phenomena (eCSAAP) system, designed to leverage the collective knowledge and experience of meteorological experts. Through a participatory co-creation process, we iteratively developed a web-based annotation tool capable of capturing multi-faceted insights from weather data and generating visualizations for expert crowdsourcing campaigns. In this context, this article investigates the intrinsic coordination among experts engaged in crowdsourcing tasks focused on the semantic annotation of extreme weather events. The study brings insights about the behavior of expert crowds by considering the cognitive biases and highlighting the impact of existing annotations on the quality of data gathered from the crowd and the collective knowledge generated. The insights regarding the crowdsourcing dynamics, particularly stigmergy, offer a promising starting point for utilizing stigmergic collaboration as an effective coordination mechanism for weather experts in crowdsourcing platforms but also in other domains requiring expertise-driven collective intelligence.},

  abstract={Deep learning's widespread adoption in various fields has made distributed training across multiple computing nodes essential. However, frequent communication between nodes can significantly slow down training speed, creating a bottleneck in distributed training. To address this issue, researchers are focusing on communication optimization algorithms for distributed deep learning systems. In this paper, we propose a standard that systematically classifies all communication optimization algorithms based on mathematical modeling, which is not achieved by existing surveys in the field. We categorize existing works into four categories based on the optimization strategies of communication: communication masking, communication compression, communication frequency reduction, and hybrid optimization. Finally, we discuss potential future challenges and research directions in the field of communication optimization algorithms for distributed deep learning systems.},

  volume={},

  abstract={Today, with the rapid development of science and technology and information technology, virtual reality technology has become increasingly mature and popular, and is increasingly applied to the field of information multimedia display. Based on Web3D technology virtual reality display design, taking furniture display as an example, this paper analyzes the current 3D modeling virtual display, panoramic virtual display and other technologies using literature analysis and case analysis, and carries out application-oriented research based on the characteristics of virtual furniture display. The development of 3D modeling parametric design in furniture design has completely changed the way designers and manufacturers manufacture furniture. By using advanced software, designers can now create accurate and detailed 3D models for their designs, enabling them to visualize and improve their ideas before actual production. A key advantage of 3D modeling is that it allows designers to try different materials, colors, textures and finishes. They can also test various configurations, sizes and proportions until the desired results are achieved. This method saves the time and money of the physical prototype and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the final product. Another advantage is that parametric design allows more accuracy in designing complex geometry, which is difficult to achieve manually. Taking the furniture exhibition hall and the sofa in the model library as examples, this paper verifies the feasibility of the furniture display design based on panoramic technology and three-dimensional modeling technology. This study involves the production, dissemination, sales and other aspects of furniture products, provides a design fulcrum for the development of furniture display under the new economic conditions, and has very important practical significance for the healthy and sustainable development of the furniture industry.},

  abstract={Aiming at the demand characteristic of some arts and crafts whose styles change fast and life cycle is short, the relation between the product characteristic and the Kanzei knowledge of customer toward product was analyzed, and the model of Kanzei-driving product design knowledge base was constructed to support rapid product design. In the model, object-oriented method was used to construct product models. SML (tabular layouts of article characteristics) technology was utilized to express the general product features(style feature, function feature, geometrical feature, material feature, colour feature, technical feature and so on), and main model and SML-based standard design elements base were created to be chosen and variated in the design process. The Kanzei measure metrics of design elements was established, and Kanzei measures of every design elements and product model (combinations mode of the elements) were evaluated according to the aesthetic principle. With HOQ (house of quality), the customers’ requirements were converted to the Kanzei requirement for product model and the design elements. The similarity algorithm of characteristics vector space model was used search the optimized product model and standard design elements from the design knowledge base to form the concept sketch and main model of products, so that the final designs of products could be rapidly completed by designers. The application in a jewelry company indicated that the method reduced average cycle of jewelry development, and improved the efficiency of product design.},

  abstract={When the new generation of designers face more complex design issues, the form of design starts to shift, with the user centered concept continuously being accentuated and applied for problem-solving. The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users. It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={This paper describes the development of Sahabat Vaksin, a web and mobile platform that aims to support willingness and timeliness in vaccinations in the community through delivery of relevant verifiable information. It is also aimed to help health workers and people of influence in the community increase their competence and confidence in countering anti vaccine narratives. Sahabat Vaksin was developed particularly for Indonesia to help mitigate the effects of anti vaccination narratives in the community. This sentiment has recently been aggravated by misinformation spread through social media and the internet. Most recently, vaccine rejections based on religious misconceptions on the permissibility of certain vaccines has been a key factor. This highlights the need to approach the issue through multiple lenses, going beyond the medical and scientific approaches. Sahabat Vaksin counters anti vaccine narratives through three main stakeholders. First, we equip midwives with adaptive counter messages that will help them deliver information to counter anti-vaccination arguments, touching on both health based as well as religious based counter-arguments, second we provide mothers with short, easy to understand information on vaccination, as well as customized, timely messages based on pregnancy stage or child age and perception towards vaccination, and (iii) we engage local religious leaders and actors to develop and spread their narrative in supporting timely vaccination, including equipping them with appropriate medical and technical knowledge to complement their religious knowledge.},

  abstract={Nonverbal vocalizations from non- and minimally speaking individuals who speak fewer than 20 words (mv* individuals) convey important communicative and affective information. While nonverbal vocalizations that occur amidst typical speech and infant vocalizations have been studied extensively in the literature, there is limited prior work on vocalizations by mv* individuals. Our work is among the first studies of the communicative and affective information expressed in nonverbal vocalizations by mv* children and adults. We collected labeled vocalizations in real-world settings with eight mv* communicators, with communicative and affective labels provided in-the-moment by a close family member. Using evaluation strategies suitable for messy, real-world data, we show that nonverbal vocalizations can be classified by function (with 4- and 5-way classifications) with F1 scores above chance for all participants. We analyze labeling and data collection practices for each participating family, and discuss the classification results in the context of our novel real-world data collection protocol. The presented work includes results from the largest classification experiments with nonverbal vocalizations from mv* communicators to date.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={82-87},
  abstract={Small and medium-sized businesses or known as SMEs are essential contributors in the software industry. Software Requirement Engineering (SRE) process is an essential part of the software development life cycle. With the advent of technology, the software has become necessary component of business, especially with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Due to this many challenges faced by IT SMEs in adoption of SRE for successful completion of projects. There have been many factors affecting the progress of SMEs among which few are reported in this SLR. A total of 40 studies are found which are relevant to the research questions and published between 2010 and 2023. The research highlights that SMEs face significant challenges when implementing effective SRE processes due to a lack of resources, experience, and tools. However, the studies propose various solutions to address these challenges, including Agile methodologies, communication enhancement, collaboration among stakeholders, and tools to support SRE processes. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the human elements of SRE, such as team dynamics, training, and motivation, and suggests that SMEs should establish specialized SRE processes that fit their requirements and resources. The article concludes that more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of SRE practices in SMEs and to provide guidelines and frameworks for improving SRE processes in this significant segment of the software industry. Overall, the research provides helpful insights into the current state of SRE practices in SMEs and highlights the potential for enhancing SRE procedures in this sector.},

  abstract={Product design is a knowledge-intensive process. In this paper Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and CAD are combined by template to realize intelligent design. Knowledge Templates (KT) are also established to develop general parts library. This KT is very suitable for general parts library development, because it can easily provide the product information, control parts size or model shape, and regulate the topology structure of an assembly. An applied case is proposed by taking hanger frame design of the supercritical boiler as an example to validate the general parts library. The KT for hanger design contains all the information of the general part manual. It can also be easily loaded into the totality design of hanger frame. This method meets the needs of constant revision of hanger frame and the design cycle is shortened greatly.},

  pages={4772-4778},
  abstract={In this article, an intelligent multifield collaborative optimization method of a through silicon via (TSV) array with performance constraints is proposed. The multiphysical field-coupled cosimulation of the TSV array is carried out using COMSOL and ANSYS, and the effects of design parameters (radius, oxide thickness, pitch, offset angle, and height) on the performance (electrical, thermal, stress, and area) of the TSV array are analyzed. The mapping relationship between the design and performance parameters is established by a neural network. A collaborative optimization strategy with performance constraints is proposed, and the design parameters are optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. According to the optimized design parameters, the simulation results of the finite-element method (FEM) are basically consistent with the predicted performance. The maximum deviation between simulation verification and optimization results is 3.04%, and the proposed method reduces the search time by 99.52% and computation time by 83.86% compared to traditional methods, respectively.},

  abstract={The rise in the incidence of global pandemics and climate catastrophes demonstrates that the demand for healthcare services is stretched beyond what services can be effectively provided. Even with increased healthcare spending in recent years in the United States and worldwide, access to healthcare resources has declined for many. To improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare solutions to meet this increasing demand and increase patient self-efficacy, connected healthcare solutions, including hospital-at-home, are being introduced. Many limitations exist for hospital-at-home models, including policy gaps, technological gaps, and issues patients face specific to their health outcomes. To overcome these limitations, a transdisciplinary framework for hospital-at-home is presented in this white paper. Barriers to the implementation of this framework are discussed, including healthcare worker burnout and the impact on the social determinants of health. Potential extensions to the transdisciplinary framework beyond hospital-at-home are also presented.},

Amongst others, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and knowledge retention across the project present important success factors in DS projects. Some of the DS process models feature documentation artifacts for this purpose but not comprehensively for the complete DS lifecycle. Accordingly, in this research, existing documentation deliverables for DS are identified and examined by means of a literature review.

  year={2023},

  abstract={One of the major criticisms of Artificial Intelligence is its lack of explainability. A claim is made by many critics that without knowing how an AI may derive a result or come to a given conclusion, it is impossible to trust in its outcomes. This problem is especially concerning when AI-based systems and applications fail to perform their tasks successfully. In this Special Issue Editorial, we focus on two main areas, explainable AI (XAI) and accuracy, and how both dimensions are critical to building trustworthy systems. We review prominent XAI design themes, leading to a reframing of the design and development effort that highlights the significance of the human, thereby demonstrating the importance of human-centered AI (HCAI). The HCAI approach advocates for a range of deliberate design-related decisions, such as those pertaining to multi-stakeholder engagement and the dissolving of disciplinary boundaries. This enables the consideration and integration of deep interdisciplinary knowledge, as evidenced in our example of social cognitive approaches to AI design. This Editorial then presents a discussion on ways forward, underscoring the value of a balanced approach to assessing the opportunities, risks and responsibilities associated with AI design. We conclude by presenting papers in the Special Issue and their contribution, pointing to future research endeavors.},

  abstract={While humans share many physical characteristics, they are not replicas of one another in appearance. Despite their uniqueness, common features mean that comparisons can be made. The ability to identify someone by face has been one of the most fundamental ways that humans have connected with each other as distinct persons [1]. Recognizing someone is in fact a form of human visual information processing [2]. Long before mirrors were available in the ancient world (circa 5th century BCE the Greeks used hand mirrors for grooming [3]), descriptions of one’s face were always determined by another’s gaze or at best one’s own description of their reflection in clean water illuminated by sunlight. Some even gained nicknames through the identification of distinct features on their forehead, nose, eyes, eyebrows, ears, and cheeks, for example, or through some clear markings, such as freckles or a birthmark. These were all the usual ways of remembering individuals; not as a means of discrimination but simply for the purposes of identification. In villages that did not exceed 250 households, it was possible to know of, and remember everyone [4], especially given that relations possessed similar and familial features.},

  abstract={French political and social scientist, Ellul [1, pp. 52–60] explained that in prehistoric times, invention was a necessity, a movement to ensure humans could survive the elements. By the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, he noticed an obvious shift in the reason for invention: from necessity to that of the special interest of the state. By the 19th century again, the reason for invention changed to that of the special interest of the bourgeoisie who could see the profits that could be generated by the deliberate development of a technique. Since about the 1600s people have invested their money in stock in order to receive dividends; this practice became particularly attractive in the 20th century.},

  abstract={Sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications and networks will continue to move to higher frequency and wider bandwidth, with much higher data rate and spectral efficiency. Given the heterogeneity and densification of Internet of Things (IoT), 6G wireless network may need to be extended to modern random access (RA) for IoT applications, which can be achieved via smart protocol design and advanced signal processing and communications technologies. The modern RA techniques, such as massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO), OFDMA, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), sparse signal processing, or new orthogonal design techniques provide good candidacy for 6G-enabled IoT. In 6G, grant-free transmission should be designed for distributed IoT applications. IoT applications are often involved in self-organizing decision making. 6G-enabled IoT will take advantage of the recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. It will generate new knowledge and understanding and accelerate discovery and innovation in IoT. Each of these efforts is designed to amplify the intrinsically multidisciplinary nature of the emerging field of IoT. The 6G-enabled IoT will establish theoretical, technical, and ethical frameworks that will be applied to tackle many challenges in IoT, advancing technology for humanity.},

  abstract={Communication systems deployed in harsh environments, such as high-speed trains, subways, deserts, trenches, forests, and underground mines, should be specially constructed to withstand extreme conditions such as high or low temperatures, corrosive humidity, extreme weather, or excessive dust and dirt. Such applications require specially designed wireless communication, fiber-optic communications, satellite communication, or signal processing techniques that can perform under extreme conditions and meet the QoS, security, and reliability requirements. Quite often, communications in harsh environments have an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high Doppler shift, and long latency, and often consume more power and energy. Bandwidth limitation in harsh environments requires spectrum efficient communications. The current state of art technologies such as massive MIMO, advanced modulation and channel coding, artificial intelligence, and signal processing provide different venues to explore this challenging area.},

  abstract={The future generation of smart cities is a very timely and attractive topic for the research community worldwide. The evolution of this generation is oriented toward providing innovative services and policymaking to guarantee the well-being of citizens. Research on smart cities is maturing and the question of securing the well-being of cities’ inhabitants is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Considering the challenges and opportunities cities/urban spaces generate, today the imperative is to examine how targeted research and cutting-edge innovation can be effectively communicated to all stakeholders. Thus, synergies emerging at the researchinnovation- policymaking nexus can be exploited and city dwellers’ well-being can be enhanced. Pervasive computing, big data analytics, crowdsourcing, and other timely technologies, including user behavior, brand popularity, recommender systems, and social media analytics, bear the promise and potential that viable solutions to key problems and challenges specific to the future generation of smart cities will be found. The objective of this Special Section in IEEE ACCESS is to examine this promise and potential from a variety of complementary interdisciplinary perspectives, including computing/ ICT, political economy, public policy, innovation, and entrepreneurship.},

  pages={2071-2078},
  abstract={Briefing: With the rapid development of information technologies such as digital twin, extended reality, and blockchain, the hype around “metaverse” is increasing at astronomical speed. However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.},

  abstract={The papers in this special section tackle technological development for the social good. THE slogan for IEEE is "Advancing Technology for Humanity".Implied within that slogan is the purpose of technology is for social good. Thus, this special issue falls within the spirit of the IEEE. The United Nations has been supporting social good with various goals, initially the millennium goals which evolved to the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The SDGs represent 17 major goals covering the three major dimensions of sustainability—environmental, social, and economic goals. The linkages between the SDGs and Industry 4.0 technologies— the latest classification of production technologies— have shown some SDG benefits from these technologies. The importance of social issues and social good is not lost on recent works on technology management. Yet, although the SDGs are about a decade old—they are only just appearing in the technology management and related topics literature. },

Concise definitions describe the term as relating to academic research that directly and or indirectly guides policymaking processes, by enabling evidence-based decision-making and or improving understanding of a given subject area or areas [1]. Underlying this and all definitions of research impact is the fundamental assumption that the outcome(s) of university research will serve the “public good” [2, p. 1368].},

  abstract={Welcome to the WICSA, QoSA, and CBSE 2016 conferences. While we had separate calls for papers, separate chairs and review processes for each conference, we had a unified, stronger community with a joint program committee. Even though the proceedings separate the papers in distinct chapters for each conference, there is a single conference program designed jointly by the program chairs of the three conferences. More precisely, papers accepted separately by the WICSA 2016, QoSA 2016, and CBSE 2016 conferences will be presented together in shared sessions. Hence, this year’s event is a great opportunity to bring together the researchers from the WICSA, QoSA and CBSE conference series. This year, WICSA, QoSA and CBSE calls for papers have attracted 149 submissions in total. Papers submitted to either WICSA, QoSA or CBSE were evaluated separately for each conference. After a careful evaluation by at least three reviewers and a following discussion period, 30 papers were accepted from WICSA, 12 from QoSA and 14 from CBSE. During the technical sessions, conference attendees will have the opportunity to listen to 56 presentations in 18 shared sessions. Some of these sessions will be working sessions with time slots dedicated to extended open discussions. In their calls for papers WICSA, QoSA, and CBSE addressed key concerns of software architectures across the system life cycle, such as designing for longevity, designing for reliability, and designing for flexibility. When we allocated the accepted papers to presentations sessions, it became evident that these concerns were shared by the three conferences. Hence the sessions were assembled to focus on these concerns.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators. It should be especially informative for oversight and governance organizations providing auditing and performance evaluations.},
