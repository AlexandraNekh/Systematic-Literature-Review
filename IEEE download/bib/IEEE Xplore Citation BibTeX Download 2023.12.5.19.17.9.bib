  abstract={The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has gained widespread attention due to the rapid advancement of Industry 4.0, technologies such as IoT, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. DT is a virtual replica of a physical object or system that enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization of its performance. This work proposes a DT system, based on automated DT creation and flexible communication across platforms to realize tool independence and to allow interchangeability of the included web-deployment and simulation environments. We apply the approach to the gearbox assembly process in an industrial use case, using the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as a common digital asset definition both for a simulation environment and a robot control program. The proposed approach addresses the challenges in representing real plants and enterprise processes in a DT by managing heterogeneous data sources, data types, data inconsistencies, and ensuring real-time capability for safety-critical applications.},

  abstract={Humanity now finds itself faced with a range of highly complex problems - such as climate change, the spread of disease, international security, scientific collaborations, product development, and so on - that call upon us to bring together large numbers of experts and stakeholders to deliberate collectively on a global scale. Collocated meetings can however be impractically expensive, severely limit the concurrency and thus breadth of interaction, and are prone to serious dysfunctions such as polarization and hidden profiles. Social media such as email, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and web forums provide unprecedented opportunities for interacting on a massive scale, but have yet to realize their potential for helping people deliberate effectively, typically generating poorly-organized, unsystematic and highly redundant contributions of widely varying quality. Large-scale argumentation systems represent a promising approach for addressing these challenges, by virtue of providing a simple systematic structure that radically reduces redundancy and encourages clarity. This paper will address this important question, discussing (1) the strengths and limitations of current deliberation technologies, and (2) how large-scale argumentation can help address these limitations.},

  abstract={Ontology is adopted as a standard for knowledge representation and sharing in collaborative design on the semantic Web. Fuzzy ontology is an extension of domain ontology for solving the uncertainty problems. To represent formally the fuzzy knowledge more effectively, this paper proposes a series of fuzzy ontology models that consists of fuzzy domain ontology, using intuitionistic fuzzy set, and fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies, considering semantic relationships between fuzzy concepts, including set relation, order relation and equivalence relation. The fuzzy ontology introduces the fuzzy concepts as values of properties and extends the ordinary relationships to fuzzy relationships and intuitionistic fuzzy relationships. The application, which uses fuzzy ontology to model knowledge of intelligent transportation, shows that these models can overcome the localization of other fuzzy ontology models, and this research facilitates the fuzzy knowledge sharing and reuse on the semantic Web.},

  abstract={Conflict resolution is one of the most challenging tasks in collaborative engineering design. In our previous research, a web-based intelligent collaborative system was developed to address this challenge based on intelligent computational argumentation. However, two important issues were not resolved in that system: priority of participants and self-conflicting arguments. In this paper, we develop two methods for incorporating priorities of participants into the computational argumentation network: 1) weighted summation and 2) re-assessment of strengths of arguments based on priority of owners of the argument using fuzzy logic inference. In addition, we develop a method for detection of self-conflicting arguments. Incorporation of priority of participants and detection of self-conflicting arguments have strengthen the capability of managing intelligent argumentation network for the web-based collaborative engineering design system developed in our previous research.},

  abstract={On-line collaborative learning is a mature research field that benefits from collaborative activities which can increase learning efficacy. However, collaborative learning approaches are still not beneficial in every e-learning experience because they require people's presence and collaboration is many times difficult to achieve. It is remarkable that collaborative learning resources still suffer from endemic problems, such as the lack of authentic interactivity, user empowerment, social identity and challenge, thus having a negative effect in learner motivation and engagement. To overcome these and other limitations and deficiencies, we propose a new type of learning object named Complex Collaborative Learning Objects to support the virtualization of collaborative sessions with the aim to leverage the knowledge elicited during live sessions of collaborative learning, which are augmented with author-generated information, in order to produce interactive and attractive resources to be played by learners. In order to improve social engagement, during the CC-LO execution, a VCS is animated so learners can observe how avatars discuss and collaborate, how discussion threads grow and how knowledge is been constructed, refined and consolidated. Furthermore, learners can interact with the CC-LO to modify some parameters observing the consequences and assessing their understanding. The research reported in this paper is currently undertaken within a FP7 European project called ALICE.},

  abstract={Intelligent networks with the associated user-interaction modalities (human-centric mechanisms) should be helping humans in their everyday activities by actively promoting human control, safety, ethics, and well-being. With intelligent networks' growing role, from facilitators in support of humans' lives and well-being to the future role as systems “designing relations between humans and the world”, their design will determine to a greater extent the character of the way humans' live their lives. At the same time, the rapid evolution of intelligent network technologies has ever more profound implications for humans and societies, and has triggered visions and initiatives to re-align the Next-Generation networks with what works for humans and humanity first. However, there is a mismatch between higher-level design intentions and reality in the context of human-centric intelligent network infrastructure, which calls for a shift and re-alignment of how human-centred theory is translated into technical configurations and practise. This P.h.D project outline investigates how future technology roadmaps can intertwine human-centric theory with the inner mechanics of IoT system technologies. In future research phases, innovation scenarios and breakthroughs are explored to direct the recommended technical specifications toward what is desirable for humanity's well-being that genuinely enhances human empowerment, with greater degrees of inclusivity, meaningful human control, and involvement. Finally, a recommendation for how to technically translate the humanity-centred network infrastructure in practise, will be investigated.},

  abstract={Semantic interoperability among heterogeneous information sources continues to pose enormous challenges to the collaborative design and other communities. In this paper a two-level ontology framework to resolving semantic conflicts in data exchange process is proposed. The top-level ontology defines generic application domain mediation concepts while task-level ontologies represent domain-related understanding. They are connected by semantic mappings, which provide top-level ontology as a mediator by translating the local schema to a common data model. A semi-automatic procedure that assists users to discover plausible semantic relationships between two types of ontology is introduced. Finally, we give an example from a product design scenario, which XML and RDF are chosen as standard syntax and semantic representing language respectively relying on the description and reasoning capabilities.},

  year={2021},
  volume={30},
  number={},
  pages={7143-7155},
  abstract={Facial action units (AUs) analysis plays an important role in facial expression recognition (FER). Existing deep spectral convolutional networks (DSCNs) have made encouraging performance for FER based on a set of facial local regions and a predefined graph structure. However, these regions do not have close relationships to AUs, and DSCNs cannot model the dynamic spatial dependencies of these regions for estimating different facial expressions. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel double dynamic relationships graph convolutional network (DDRGCN) to learn the strength of the edges in the facial graph by a trainable weighted adjacency matrix. We construct facial graph data by 20 regions of interest (ROIs) guided by different facial AUs. Furthermore, we devise an efficient graph convolutional network in which the inherent dependencies of vertices in the facial graph can be learned automatically during network training. Notably, the proposed model only has 110K parameters and 0.48MB model size, which is significantly less than most existing methods. Experiments on four widely-used FER datasets demonstrate that the proposed dynamic relationships graph network achieves superior results compared to existing light-weight networks, not just in terms of accuracy but also model size and speed.},

  abstract={This paper presents AppealNet, a novel edge/cloud collaborative architecture that runs deep learning (DL) tasks more efficiently than state-of-the-art solutions. For a given input, AppealNet accurately predicts on-the-fly whether it can be successfully processed by the DL model deployed on the resource-constrained edge device, and if not, appeals to the more powerful DL model deployed at the cloud. This is achieved by employing a two-head neural network architecture that explicitly takes inference difficulty into consideration and optimizes the tradeoff between accuracy and computation/communication cost of the edge/cloud collaborative architecture. Experimental results on several image classification datasets show up to more than 40% energy savings compared to existing techniques without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract={This study explores the feasibility of allocating finite resources beyond fifth generation networks for extended reality applications through the implementation of enhanced security measures via offloading analysis (RLIS). The quantification of resources is facilitated through the utilization of parameters, namely energy, capacity, and power, which are equipped with proximity constraints. These constraints are then integrated with activation functions in both multilayer perceptron and long short term memory models. Furthermore, the system model has been developed using vision-based computing, which involves managing data queues in terms of waiting periods to minimize congestion for data transmission with limited resources. The major significance of the proposed method is to utilize allocated spectrums for future generation networks by allocating necessary resources and therefore high usage of resources by all users can be avoided. In addition the advantage of the proposed method is secure the networks that operate beyond 5G where more number of users will try to share the allocated resources that needs to be provided with high security conditions.},

  abstract={As the demand for machine learning, edge computing, and the Internet of Things technology increases, computing efficiency and energy consumption has become an important basis for computing choices. Although the graphics processing unit(GPU) has a high degree of parallel computing capability, its energy consumption is large, and the data transmission is limited by the system bus bandwidth. Therefore, our laboratory previously proposed the Brain Memory Architecture prototype architecture, which integrates FPGA and memory as a computing architecture, which has the advantages of high-efficiency, and low-power computing and does not require data exchange through the system bus. Based on this prototype architecture, this paper constructs the Brain Memory Architecture HW/SW Co-Design Platform (BMCD platform) to provide a good user interface so that users can easily build a hardware and software collaborative design computing environment. Through the library provided by the platform to establish the data transmission and calculation between acceleration hardware and memory to solve the bandwidth limitation of the traditional system bus. In this platform, the AXI4-stream interconnect core is provided as a standard interface for data handshaking with acceleration hardware, which reduces user design complexity and maintains the scalability of connection with other computing IP cores. In platform evaluation, design and adaptive CNN algorithm for hardware and software design platform, provide data quantization methods to reduce data bits to reduce the required data bandwidth and storage space and propose a dynamic adjustment algorithm for integer and decimal ratios to correct the accuracy and design problems that may be caused by data quantization. With this adaptive CNN algorithm architecture and BMCD platform to construct a rapid data transmission. This paper finally analyzes the comparison of the weight transmission time of different CNN models with the CPU and the GPU. The method proposed in this paper can reach about 20 times faster than the CPU and about 10 times faster than the GPU.},

A total of 60 experienced nurses participated in an iterative design of an interactive graphical interface for remote behavior monitoring. Results of the study indicate that usability of the system improves over multiple iterations of participatory design. In addition, the resulting interface is useful for identifying behavior patterns that are indicative of chronic health conditions and unexpected health events.

  year={2020},
  volume={50},

  pages={434-443},
  abstract={Choosing adequate gestures for touchless interfaces is a challenging task that has a direct impact on human-computer interaction. Such gestures are commonly determined by the designer, ad-hoc, rule-based, or agreement-based methods. Previous approaches to assess agreement grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this article, we propose a generalized framework that inherently incorporates the gesture descriptors into the agreement analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, we represent gestures using binary description vectors and allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as soft agreement rate (SAR) to measure the level of agreement and provide a mathematical justification for this metric. Furthermore, we perform computational experiments to study the behavior of SAR and demonstrate that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our method is evaluated and tested through a guessability study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR is 2.64 times higher than the previous metrics. Finally, we show that our approach complements the existing agreement techniques by generating an artificial lexicon based on the most agreed properties.},

  abstract={As human beings, we have the inherent bias towards our likes and dislikes. These likes and dislikes are influenced by our psychographic attributes, morals, values, beliefs and societal networks in both circles of influence and circles of concern. We continuously consume products, services as well as produce products and services for others to consume. Due to our inherent bias of likes and dislikes, we unintentionally or intentionally end up liking products and/or services that are personalized for us, or somehow unintentionally match our likes. This personalization makes our lives easier and more comfortable as it may save time, and/or enable us to achieve desired experiences. This personalization is influenced by the data gathered about us directly or indirectly. The richer the data is about us, the more personalized products and services we receive, thereby saving us time and money whilst meeting our desired goals for experience or exchange of value for the offers we are wanting. We remain forever concerned about the direct or accidental use of our data that can fall into the hands of nefarious users of the dark web, or criminals who can cause us all kinds of harm using the data we shared. Herein lies the paradox of personalization and privacy. To solve this paradox, we acknowledge that there has to be a trade-off between data privacy and personalization, and an optimized match on trust, value etc. between the data owners (data subjects) and data buyers. In this paper, we propose approaches to handle these trade-offs in an optimized way with the acceptance threshold determined by a methodology to optimize the match between trust and value perceptions specific to an individual, and in context of the trust we place on the data controller, processor or buyer entity with which we share and entrust our data for the exchange of value provided.},

  abstract={This paper argues for a future research agenda that re-orients the design of internet-of-things applications, in particular within the Smart City context, with the aim to counter the prevailing technological opportunism that drives innovation in this field. I discuss why participation of stakeholders in the design of such technology is essential, but also needs to evolve to recognise its political dimension. Possible pathways for such a re-politicising of participation in design are discussed with concepts of Agonistic Design, Critical Design and Design in Use. Alongside these methodological concerns, I argue, it is necessary to also rethink our underlying theoretical understanding of the relationship between humans and technology. To reflect the intimate entanglement, I propose to look at post-humanist theories and new materialism. The goal of this position paper is to provoke discussion and critical reflection.},

  abstract={This paper explores human-building interaction as an active factor in the early stages of the design process. Current design methods allow a range of highly sophisticated tools to measure and analyze quantitative design parameters such as structural, thermal, lighting performance and more. However, interpreting human preferences and occupant behaviour as metrics to inform early design stages remains largely unexplored. Game engines’ are examined for their capacity to steer the design process and embed performance data. Furthermore, the virtual environments they enable are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively as tools for engaging with user preferences. The resultant metrics are then exported into architectural design software to be used as tools by the designer. Finally, the present context in which game engines are applied in architectural design is examined. The paper proposes a framework that enables non-designers to participate in a data-driven, performance-aware participatory environment actively is created and ready for data collection. Components of the platform include direct and indirect user feedback that enable designers to understand user preferences and quantify its qualitative features. Finally, a case study is presented using the developed platform to design high-performance facade panels.},

  abstract={Wikipedia has been built to gather encyclopedic knowledge using a collaborative social process that has proved its effectiveness. However, the workload required for raising the quality and increasing the coverage of Wikipedia is exhausting the community. Based on several participatory design sessions with active Wikipedia contributors (a.k.a. Wikipedians), we have collected a set of measures related to Wikipedia activity that, if available and visualized effectively, could spare a lot of monitoring time to these Wikipedians, allowing them to focus on quality and coverage of Wikipedia instead of spending their time navigating heavily to track vandals and copyright infringements. However, most of these measures cannot be computed on the fly using the available Wikipedia API. Therefore, we have designed an open architecture called WikiReactive to compute incrementally and maintain several aggregated measures on the French Wikipedia. This aggregated data is available as a Web Service and can be used to overlay information on Wikipedia articles through Wikipedia Skins or for new services for Wikipedians or people studying Wikipedia. This article describes the architecture, its performance and some of its uses.},

  abstract={One of the many difficulties faced in cities include the accumulation of waste in streets, sidewalks, public squares, causing major environmental problems. This is not only due to lack of public policies and urban infrastructure, but also lack of citizen participation. Given this scenario, there is a crucial need to educate the people, especially children, who represent the future of society. This study presents a mobile serious game proposal, called “Protecting the Earth”, about selective waste collection, recycling, reduction of waste production and waste reuse in different game stages with focuses in childish public. The methodology adopted included Systematic Review; application of Participatory Design methods, such as the Context Inquiry technique; specification of functional and non-functional requirements and the study of technologies appropriate for developing the project. Experiments were conducted with children aiming to assess the proposed tool's interface. The results obtained by means of usability testing with users showed the need for adjustments in the interface in order to achieve greater accessibility and user satisfaction, and were met immediately. The next step is to perform learning evaluation experiments in order to verify if the proposed serious game is collaborating to acquire user knowledge about the study object (Environmental Education).},

  year={2012},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={A substantial amount of subjectivity is involved in how people use language and conceptualize the world. Computational methods and formal representations of knowledge usually neglect this kind of individual variation. We have developed a novel method, Grounded Intersubjective Concept Analysis (GICA), for the analysis and visualization of individual differences in language use and conceptualization. The GICA method first employs a conceptual survey or a text mining step to elicit from varied groups of individuals the particular ways in which terms and associated concepts are used among the individuals. The subsequent analysis and visualization reveals potential underlying groupings of subjects, objects and contexts. One way of viewing the GICA method is to compare it with the traditional word space models. In the word space models, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), statistical analysis of word-context matrices reveals latent information. A common approach is to analyze term-document matrices in the analysis. The GICA method extends the basic idea of the traditional term-document matrix analysis to include a third dimension of different individuals. This leads to a formation of a third-order tensor of size subjects × objects × contexts. Through flattening into a matrix, these subject-object-context (SOC) tensors can again be analyzed using various computational methods including principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA) or any existing or future method suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In order to demonstrate the use of the GICA method, we present the results of two case studies. In the first case, GICA of health-related concepts is conducted. In the second one, the State of the Union addresses by US presidents are analyzed. In these case studies, we apply multidimensional scaling (MDS), the self-organizing map (SOM) and Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) as specific data analysis methods within the overall GICA method. The GICA method can be used, for instance, to support education of heterogeneous audiences, public planning processes and participatory design, conflict resolution, environmental problem solving, interprofessional and interdisciplinary communication, product development processes, mergers of organizations, and building enhanced knowledge representations in semantic web.},

  abstract={Like designing systems to advance or achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG), designing public interest technologies (PIT) needs to prioritize qualitative values of people and communities as suprafunctional requirements. This can be seen as in the instance of applying the methodology of value-sensitive design (VSD). However, with PIT, there are a number of correlated concepts: having established the value that is in the public interest to be monitored, measured or maintained, it is necessary to identify and design for expectations, accountability, and reflexivity. In this article, we present a conceptual model of concepts involved in public interest technology design, and specify a metaplatform that could be used to implement such designs. We conclude by arguing that this approach supports participatory design involving all the stakeholders impacted by PIT, which, if seen to the product of both joint design and joint debate, would be more likely to be accepted, used, and trusted by communities.},

  abstract={A key challenge in human-robot interaction (HRI) design is to create and sustain engaging social interactions. This paper argues that improvisational techniques from the performing arts can address this challenge. Contrary to the ways in which improvisation is generally used in social robotics, we propose an understanding of improvisational techniques as based on rules that shape motion choices. We claim that such an approach, represented in what we name the “external” and “emergent” perspectives on improvisation, could benefit the way in which robot movement and behaviour is designed and deployed, increasing playful engagement and responsiveness. As an example of this type of improvisation, we discuss how American dancer and choreographer William Forsythe's Improvisation Technologies could be used in an HRI context. We also report on a preliminary experimentation using a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory prototyping system and a participatory design method with professional dancers geared towards the exploration of interactive movement possibilities with a Pepperrobot. Finally, we report on how this workshop offered valuable information about the applicability of these tools, as well as reflections on how it could help increase the level of engagement in the interaction.},

To explore ways to contribute to the mitigation of this problem, inspired by participatory design techniques, we conducted a series of activities with teachers and students. After a qualitative analysis of the results, a model for the successful technological mediation of the teaching and learning processes emerged, which we call FORTAGONO.

  abstract={Digital twins are quickly becoming a popular tool in several domains, taking advantage of recent advancements in the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Big Data, while being used by both the industry sector and the research community. In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.},

  abstract={The digitization of smart grid distributed generation and industrial control systems has prompted utilities to deploy tools with ubiquitous communications that potentially widen the attack surface. The utilities still continue to rely on the traditional cybersecurity technologies, such as firewalls, anti-malware tools, and passwords that do not ensure security across all dimensions of the information assurance model required for a strong cybersecurity business process. This paper proposes a multidimensional holistic framework that addresses this gap through advanced technologies, intelligent algorithms, and continued assessments. To show proof, the layered defense model, a solution dimension of the framework, is integrated into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Security and Resilience Testbed to replicate a utility's enterprise and substation networks. The model is used to evaluate the security and resilience of microgrid control systems, and, based on the insights gathered, recommend best practices for utility cybersecurity analysts for a strong business process. With this baseline, the paper conceptually introduces intelligence-driven solutions comprising contextual data analysis and machine learning to respond to advanced persistent threats sponsored by campaign efforts.},

  volume={},

  pages={229-238},
  abstract={Online feature request management systems are popular tools for gathering stakeholder requirements during system evolution. Deciding which feature requests require attention and how much upfront analysis to perform on them is an important problem in this context: too little upfront analysis may result in inadequate functionalities being developed, costly changes, and wasted development effort; too much upfront analysis is a waste of time and resources. Early predictions about which feature requests are most likely to fail due to insufficient or inadequate upfront analysis could facilitate such decisions. Our objective is to study whether it is possible to make such predictions automatically from the characteristics of the online discussions on feature requests. The paper presents a tool-implemented framework that automatically constructs failure prediction models using machine-learning classification algorithms and compares the performance of the different techniques for the Firefox and Netbeans projects. The comparison relies on a cost-benefit model for assessing the value of additional upfront analysis. In this model, the value of additional upfront analysis depends on its probability of success in preventing failures and on the relative cost of the failures it prevents compared to its own cost. We show that for reasonable estimations of these two parameters automated prediction models provide more value than a set of baselines for some failure types and projects. This suggests that automated failure prediction during online requirements elicitation may be a promising approach for guiding requirements engineering efforts in online settings.},

  abstract={Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.},

  abstract={Pick your favorite complex societal issue. For example, how could the US government, its citizens, and its energy companies reach an acceptable future national US energy plan? How could such a complex problem even be approached in a rational and transparent manner? We discuss a recently developed Internet-based method for clarifying issues, providing insights into understanding causes of conflict in large stakeholder groups facing complex issues, and reaching consent. This method has been tested on a variety of complex social and technical issues that illustrate how the Internet can be used to harness the collective intelligence of large stakeholder groups. This work further shows how to positively influence the capability of large stakeholder networks to make more informed decisions. As our main objective, we outline the key open research questions for applying Internet based collective intelligence methods in very large stakeholder networks. As a case study we examine what it would take to develop "the lay of the land" of possibly millions of stakeholders for the possible future US energy systems. We discuss stakeholder access issues, inherent conflict of interest issues, as well as the necessary machine automation of the collective intelligence method to handle this scale of stakeholder involvement.},

  abstract={This study is part of a larger project that wants to foster social initiation behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We approach this through a full-body interactive Mixed Reality (MR) experience that mediates a face-to-face play session between an ASD child and a non-ASD child. The goal of this study is to obtain a data model that allows us to evaluate the goodness of the MR system compared to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools (in this case LEGO bricks) which acts as the control condition. In this paper we present our first analysis of the arousal generated by the MR experience compared to that generated in the control condition. We address this by analyzing psychophysiological data recorded during the social interaction behaviors in the ASD child while playing with the non-ASD child. We followed a repeated-measures design with two conditions: our full-body interaction MR environment and the typical social intervention strategy based on LEGO bricks. To measure physiology, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Accelerometer (ACC) data were acquired through a wearable designed by our lab. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the huge amount of multimodal data from the ASD children obtained during 18 trials (3 female and 15 male). As a result, we were capable of classifying social initiation behaviors of ASD children during the MR environment sessions and those occurring during the LEGO construction sessions based on the psycho-physiological data sources. This is a first sign showing that our MR system has specific properties, compared to a traditional construction-based intervention, which potentially provide a new interesting context to intervention in ASD.},

In this context, a literature review on technological innovation features is conducted to recognize potential gaps in ongoing research. Cloud computing is altering the way goods are developed, allowing for greater collaboration between corporate IT and other business divisions such as sales, finance, and forecasting, and encouraging increased customerinvolvement, even to the point of collaboratively designing products with customers. The unique insights provided by the findings can aid businesses in improving their cloud computing usage and deeplearning. Big data and machine-learning capabilities are becoming more available from cloud computing, in addition to primary processing and storage. Due to the relationship between deep learning and the cloud, the firm gains competitive advantages that speed up processes and procedures, placing it on par with the market's key competitors and making it more strategically competitive and technologically well-organized. However, deep learning with the cloud cantransform business in productivity and efficiency to fulfil its commitment. This collaboration increases the company's ability to identify commercial opportunities by offering a comprehensive, well-defined, aggressive, and limitless (thanks to the cloud) database to manageand use strategically. Furthermore, the relationship between deep learning and cloud computing has acommercial impact since it enables automatic transaction identification and allocation, anomalydetection, and the ongoing development of predictive solutions. A cloud environment learns from the data itgathers, makes predictions, and fixes possible issuesbefore the user even realises they exist. These developments lead the company to recognise that cloudcomputing and deep learning are becoming increasingly entwined.},

  abstract={The more complex the processes, the higher the need for process transparency through high-quality real-time data. The steady improvement of Internet-of-Things technologies, or of the recently phrased cyber physical systems, during the last years ensures this process transparency. Although these technologies are promising, the potential of IoT/CPS technologies is not yet fully applied in practice. One reason is that technology novices have difficulties participating in development processes and consequently prevent case-specific and relevant services from being described. This paper presents an adaptive interface approach to support the development and utilization of IoT solutions. An exemplary solution is presented based on an IoT toolkit with a GUI for configuration, making service development possible without coding skills. Based on experiment observations, design improvements of the GUI are implemented. Furthermore, a more sophisticated design is introduced. This will allow users with different competence levels to improve their interaction with sensor and actuator networks further; consequently, more appropriate solutions can be developed and used.},

For the simplification, we remodel the backbone based on MobileNet v2 and replace every 3×3 convolution in the detection neck and head by the fusion of a 3 × 3 depthwise separable convolution and a squeeze and excitation block (DSConv+SE); for the attention enhancement, we introduce the high-frequency wavelets of the original image to the input, a simplified non- local block to the simplified backbone and convolutional block attention modules to the simplified detection neck. In addition, local 3×3 convolution branches are introduced to the simplified backbone for enhanced learning capability. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms each compared state-of-the-art work in one or more aspects.},

  abstract={Complex products and increasing domain specialization have led to a collaborative design environment in which multiple partners are relied upon to successfully realize a product. In such an environment there is a need for computational frameworks that assist in communicating decision making knowledge. In this research a Decision Support Ontology (DSO) is developed to facilitate decision making within collaborative design. The structure of the information model developed reflects a priori knowledge of decision making and supports the communication of information independent of any specific decision method. Accordingly, the DSO includes decision-related information such as the design issue, alternatives, evaluation, criteria and preferences. It also includes decision rationale and assumptions, as well as any constraints created by the decision and the decision outcome. The DSO is built upon the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which facilitates the sharing and integration of decision-making information between multiple collaborators via the Web and Description Logic. Although the information model developed is based on engineering design literature, the DSO captures generic decision information, and therefore could be adapted to be used beyond the engineering design domain.},

  abstract={Root cause analysis (RCA) is a highly effective methodology for product design teams and manufacturing managers to engage in creative problem solving by utilizing the tools of the Fourth Industrial Revolution-Industry 4.0. This article outlines the RCA problem-solving process as it is applied to detect and resolve problems in a consumer product manufacturing setting. This article presents a case study of collaborative design, testing, and implementation of a product-specific solution to resolve quality control issues caused by a flawed component specification. The provided case study details company's application of RCA. Once the problem is identified, we describe how the design and production teams collaborated to verify and validate the revised product design via three-dimensional product simulations. Having identified a solution, the company's manufacturing managers and supervisory staff incorporate this change into their standard operating procedures, conduct staff training, and share the solution across the organization. This problem-solving approach, implemented as part of a wider continuous improvement effort, also includes the utilization of digital applications and smart devices to share data across the company in real time.},

  abstract={Employee data is increasingly becoming crucial for organisations to improve workflow and foresight. Furthermore, with the onset of the GDPR law, the MyData movement is pushing for human-centric personal data. This presents an opportunity not only to improve how employees can understand their data, but also have transparency and control over it. This paper investigates how a collaborative design process was used at a technology consultancy company to design a service aimed at enabling data transparency and control as well as at communicating its value. We collected qualitative data from a survey, interviews, and workshops conducted with employees. We then built a prototype and tested its usability using a questionnaire. Results showed a clear need among participants for transparency. Results also showed the effectiveness of the prototype in positively enhancing transparency and in generating a good level of usability. The adopted process also led to the formulation of data categories to improve the service's comprehensiveness. Taken together, our results highlight how the proposed model of co-creative design may aid complex transformations in large technology organisations. We provide a set of recommendations in this space and envision future directions for our study.},

This paper proposed an innovative experimental teaching method of software and hardware collaborative design to better develop students' system view, structure view, engineering view of computers. An FPGA-based CNN accelerator was designed to combining the knowledge from software to compilation and then to hardware. The main innovations are: (1) Innovation of experimental system: A “curriculum tree” based on knowledge map was built to identify the implicit relationship between software and hardware knowledge. The curriculum was changed from Horizontal Teaching to Vertical Teaching in order to reduce the difficulties of cultivating system ability; (2) Innovation of experiment contents: it proposed an experiment teaching strategy of “Managing Complexity With Simplicity” guided by Occam's razor and used some effective methods to simply the system knowledge of each course around the top-level goals; (3) Innovation of experiment methods: a procedural and flow-based experiment model based on hierarchical experimental contents was used to achieve spiral progressive learning from software design to hardware simulation and then to system development; @Innovation of experiment platforms: an innovative method of conducting experiments, MODE (MODE = Experiment + MOOC) was proposed to allow students to do experiments “anytime, anywhere and on demand”.},

  abstract={Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an efficient recognition algorithm used in pattern recognition, image processing, etc. The problem of how to build an efficient computational system for CNNs has become a pressing one, which is traditionally achieved by software optimization or hardware accelerator design. In contrast, this paper argues that software algorithms and hardware architectures affect each other in neural network applications with a high degree of coupling. In this paper, we propose a software and hardware-based co-optimization design to improve CNNs’ processing efficiency by co-optimization of software and hardware. First, a modular analysis and collaborative design are carried out for the ShuffleNetV2 model by implementing quantization and improving the computational unit. Second, the model is optimized based on reconfigurable computing devices for its characteristics. Third, 8 bit quantization is implemented, while the depth-separable convolution operation and channel selection module is redesigned to make the module perform operations in a hardware-friendly form. The experimental work was carried out on the FPGA platform Xilin xzynqxc-7Z045 using High Level Synthesis (HLS). The experimental results show that the optimized model has a significant improvement in terms of resource utilization and latency.},

  abstract={Attention mechanisms form the basis of providing temporal explanations for a variety of state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures. However, evidence is lacking that attention mechanisms are capable of providing sufficiently valid medical explanations. In this study we focus on the quality of temporal explanations for the medical problem of adverse drug event (ADE) prediction by comparing explanations globally and locally provided by an attention-based RNN architecture against those provided by more a more basic RNN using the post-hoc SHAP framework, a popular alternative option which adheres to several desirable explainability properties. The validity of this comparison is supported by medical expert knowledge gathered for the purpose of this study. This investigation has uncovered that these explanation methods both possess appropriateness for ADE explanations and may be used complementarily, due to SHAP providing more clinically appropriate global explanations and attention mechanisms capturing more clinically appropriate local explanations. Additional feedback from medical experts reveal that SHAP may be more applicable to real-time clinical encounters, in which efficiency must be prioritised, over attention explanations which possess properties more appropriate for offline analyses.},

  abstract={Autonomous robotic systems are being proposed for use in hazardous environments, often to reduce the risks to human workers. In the immediate future, it is likely that human workers will continue to use and direct these autonomous robots, much like other computerised tools but with more sophisticated decision-making. Therefore, one important area on which to focus engineering effort is ensuring that these users trust the system. Recent literature suggests that explainability is closely related to how trustworthy a system is. Like safety and security properties, explainability should be designed into a system, instead of being added afterwards. This paper presents an abstract architecture that supports an autonomous system explaining its behaviour (explainable autonomy), providing a design template for implementing explainable autonomous systems. We present a worked example of how our architecture could be applied in the civil nuclear industry, where both workers and regulators need to trust the system’s decision-making capabilities.},

  abstract={Developing an infrastructure for efficiently coordinating a group of autonomous robots has become a challenging need in robotics community. In recent years, the use of teams of coordinated mobile robots has been explored in several application fields such as military, exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue missions. For such fields, the use of multiple robots enable for robustness at mission accomplishment. In this paper we present a service-oriented, distributed architecture for coordinating a set of mobile robots on the way to a common goal. The main design aspects concern the ease of extendibility, scalability, re-usability and integration of rapidly changing robotic hardware and software, and the support of different application domains rather than limiting to specific tasks' requirements and algorithms. We integrate state of the art ideas such as Service-Oriented Robotics in order to achieve novel solutions. We demonstrate working cooperative autonomous operations using multiple robots with time-suitable communications. This work is an early phase of our ultimate goal, which is to have multiple heterogeneous autonomous robots forming an intelligent system that can be able to deal with highly dynamic and challenging environments such as a first responders team in search and rescue missions.},

  abstract={Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold significant promise to support the independence, well-being and safety of older adults living with frailty or dementia at home. However, further studies are needed to identify: 1) valuable scenarios of support, 2) desired interactive features, and 3) key challenges preventing long-term adoption and utility in dementia care. In this paper, we explore the role of conversational technology in ageing and dementia care at home. Using a community-based participatory approach, we engaged 20 stakeholders, including people with lived experience of dementia and frailty, to understand preferences, perceived benefits and concerns about integrating conversational AI into daily routines at home. We uncovered key roles of the technology, including support of daily functions, health monitoring, risk mitigation, and cognitive stimulation. We emphasize the need for adapting interactions to different levels of user familiarity and progression of cognitive decline. We address the importance of the communication style and suggest careful use of open-ended questions with target populations. We further discuss feasibility considerations to overcome current barriers to adoption. Overall, this work proposes design guidelines to shape the future conceptualization and development of natural language interactions to support dementia care at home},

These technically-oriented processes attempt to simplify the verification and validation of design artifacts used during software development. Yet, many EA projects fail mostly for non-technical reasons. The development of an EA can necessitate organizational change which can influence stakeholder behavior in ways that may be detrimental to the EA. An analysis of EAFs finds that they are deficient in incorporating human behavior and that they avoid any of the consequences of human action during EA development.

The current paper describes a planned research study to work out answers to three research questions of the CareSAR1 research program: (A)What is the status of digitized assistive tools that are primarily designed and developed to support carers in long-term care institutions and home care?(B)What are the main reasons why existing digitized tools and equipment/devices using artificial intelligence are not yet used to the extent that is needed to mitigate the shortage of carers in a crisis and critical situations?(C)What kind of support can be provided by a living lab that is designed to develop effective, ethical, and socially acceptable digital devices to assist carers in their caring environment? The analysis of projects, that were designed to develop assisting robots to mitigate the lack of carers and the research of existing living labs conducted in social care institutions shall evaluate the opportunities how social assistive robots get the chance to be used largely.},

  abstract={BIM software has made a qualitative leap in the management of building in-formation data. Informatization will promote the development of industrialization. There is a unified system for the standardized design and production of prefabricated buildings, which plays a good role in promoting the development of BIM. In the design stage, the component information is generated and the unique code is assigned. At the same time, the batch classification export of component QR code and the component information update mechanism are realized in Revit; In the production stage, upload quality inspection reports and other relevant materials through the platform; In the construction stage, check the basic information and location of components, and conduct acceptance operation. The whole process takes component code as the unique mark and QR code as the unified carrier to form a complete BIM model design, production and construction data chain of prefabricated buildings, which can solve the problem of information island in traditional prefabricated building design, production and construction management. Realize the information, intelligent and visual management of the whole process of component design, production, transportation, construction and hoisting.},

  abstract={In recent times, blockchain has received a lot of exposure due to its increased usage in many fields. Blockchain is a decentralized and open ledger that contains information on transactions. It works as an underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and others. It eliminates the double-spending problem by implementing the digital signature mechanism. Blockchain technology has evolved to address the confidentiality and other technical issues that come with using distributed databases. It offers a decentralized environment for processing the transactions, establishes trust among the nodes participating in the network, and also removes the use of central third-party authority. The blockchain contains information on every transaction and is completely change-resistant. It offers peer-to-peer networks in which all nodes are able to validate the transactions happening in the network using a consensus mechanism. This is a very revolutionary technology that has been developed and widely used in a variety of fields. But still having some challenges like security, privacy, storage, scalability, latency, higher consumption of energy, and others. In this paper, the two popular open-source tools for blockchain technology are presented: Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Ethereum is public and permissionless platform whereas Hyperledger Fabric is private and permissioned. The Transaction life cycle of Ethereum and the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric are discussed.},

  abstract={Although large companies have progressed in digital transformation (DT) of factories using Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have not progressed enough. However, considering the efficiency and value creation of the entire supply chain, it is important to promote a smart factory in not only large companies but also SMEs. This study examines the success factors and mechanisms based on the case studies of Japanese SMEs that have successfully implemented smart factories. Then, its characteristics are compared with those of large companies. Specifically, in SMEs, where the top management and the factory floor are in close proximity, if the purposes and vision of DT are clear and the top management understands its possibilities and limitations, successful experiences can spread throughout the company through trial and error using an in-house system optimized for the factory floor. This study reveals that the success mechanism makes it easier for SMEs to promote DX than for large companies under certain conditions, which is a new finding and a theoretical contribution. The practical contribution of this study is that it guides SMEs to promote DT in factories in SMEs based on this mechanism.},

  abstract={Inconsistencies, unclear processes, and procedures in most democratic countries' election management, particularly vote-counting, cause mistrust and dispute in election results. This study explores the perceptions and expectations of electoral stakeholders on vote counting and validation processes in different African countries. Employing thematic analysis and using the Activity Theory as a lens, the research identifies key themes, such as technical aspects, accuracy, speed, efficiency, transparency, security, challenges, improvements, and the roles of observers and Election Management Bodies (EMBs). The findings highlight various challenges, such as poor network coverage, insufficient staff training, and corruption, informing the formation of a requirement specification for vote counting and validation systems. Despite potential drawbacks and challenges associated with technology solutions, the study proposes a set of ideal requirements specifications for an accurate, efficient, transparent, and secure election vote counting and validation process. The study contributes to ongoing discussions on transparency, accessibility, and the use of electronic voting systems to enhance electoral accuracy and integrity. It suggests avenues for future research, including evaluating legal and regulatory frameworks, voter education, technical challenges, and alternative technological approaches to vote counting and validation.},

  abstract={The modeling of landscape change and socio-ecological systems (SES) tends to ignore the interactions across distance and boundaries. To fill the gap, this research analyzes landscape change by considering the tele-coupling effects at the local scale between Owyhee county and Treasure Valley in Idaho, United States. The spatial distribution of recreational activities in Owyhee county are modeled by Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST). Land use and cover change (LUCC) are simulated using Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN). Results show that the tele-coupling effects have significant impacts on the nature-based recreation in Owyhee county. With the tele-coupling effects, MLPNN has achieved a high overall accuracy and kappa coefficient in LUCC. The findings suggest that the tele-coupling effects should be incorporated into the modeling of landscape change and SES. This study also provides policy implications for land management and stakeholder involvement in accommodating landscape change.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a free dataset, available at the following link,1 named KIMORE, regarding different rehabilitation exercises collected by a RGB-D sensor. Three data inputs including RGB, depth videos, and skeleton joint positions were recorded during five physical exercises, specific for low back pain and accurately selected by physicians. For each exercise, the dataset also provides a set of features, specifically defined by the physicians, and relevant to describe its scope. These features, validated with respect to a stereophotogrammetric system, can be analyzed to compute a score for the subject's performance. The dataset also contains an evaluation of the same performance provided by the clinicians, through a clinical questionnaire. The impact of KIMORE has been analyzed by comparing the output obtained by an example of rule and template-based approaches and the clinical score. The dataset presented is intended to be used as a benchmark for human movement assessment in a rehabilitation scenario in order to test the effectiveness and the reliability of different computational approaches. Unlike other existing datasets, the KIMORE merges a large heterogeneous population of 78 subjects, divided into 2 groups with 44 healthy subjects and 34 with motor dysfunctions. It provides the most clinically-relevant features and the clinical score for each exercise.},

  pages={319-326},
  abstract={This study provides a comparative analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethical guidelines by looking at six different sources from the USA, European Union, India, Philippines, UNESCO, and CAIDP. The researchers extracted key terms from these guidelines and categorized them based on their frequency across the six sources to get a deeper understanding of their content and identify central themes and topics across each guideline. In doing so, the paper was able to identify ethical considerations and challenges of implementing AI in the Philippine context, including data collection, use and sharing, and AI development. The insights from the literature and document reviews and the analysis of the extracted key terms were used to craft considerations in formulating AI policy for the Philippines. These include (1) defining ethical principles and values in developing and implementing AI, (2) establishing mechanisms for ensuring fairness and preventing bias, (3) implementing mechanisms to ensure security and mitigating risks in AI systems, and (4) assessing potential impacts on AI technologies. Overall, the study uncovered that existing guidelines and legal frameworks on AI ethics seem to have put less emphasis on ethics and fairness. This underpins the need for the PH to ensure that its localized AI ethics policy is clear about its definition of what is ethical and fair use of AI across sectors, industries., demographics, and contexts.},

  pages={464-517},
  abstract={As the services and requirements of next-generation wireless networks become increasingly diversified, it is estimated that the current frequency bands of mobile network operators (MNOs) will be unable to cope with the immensity of anticipated demands. Due to spectrum scarcity, there has been a growing trend among stakeholders toward identifying practical solutions to make the most productive use of the exclusively allocated bands on a shared basis through spectrum sharing mechanisms. However, due to the technical complexities of these mechanisms, their design presents challenges, as it requires coordination among multiple entities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we begin with a detailed review of the recent literature on spectrum sharing methods, classifying them on the basis of their operational frequency regime—that is, whether they are implemented to operate in licensed bands (e.g., licensed shared access (LSA), spectrum access system (SAS), and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS)) or unlicensed bands (e.g., LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U), licensed assisted access (LAA), MulteFire, and new radio-unlicensed (NR-U)). Then, in order to narrow the gap between the standardization and vendor-specific implementations, we provide a detailed review of the potential implementation scenarios and necessary amendments to legacy cellular networks from the perspective of telecommunication vendors and regulatory bodies. Next, we analyze applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for facilitating spectrum sharing mechanisms and leveraging the full potential of autonomous sharing scenarios. Finally, we conclude the paper by presenting open research challenges, which aim to provide insights into prospective research endeavors.},

  pages={2376-2385},
  abstract={The considerable previous work characterizing visualization usage has focused on low-level tasks or interactions and high-level tasks, leaving a gap between them that is not addressed. This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

The EPI-MEDICS solution design also provides ambient, intelligent, and pervasive computing services offering any citizen a ubiquitous, reliable, and efficient management of his/her own cardiac status. A multicentric evaluation performed in Europe with a series of device prototypes and the performance assessment of the original methods of signal synthesis that were designed to guarantee a high interoperability level of the recorded data within the clinical practice, as well as of the decision-support methodologies that were developed for an early detection of life-threatening myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia, at home or anywhere, demonstrate the pertinence of going toward a personal health society in cardiology, which still yields the highest mortality rate in industrialized countries.},

  abstract={Non Functional Requirements (NFRs) are relative, so are the conflicts among them. In our previously developed catalogue of NFRs conflicts it can be observed that a number of specific pairs of NFRs are claimed to be in conflicts in some cases but they are also claimed not to be in conflict in the other cases. These relative conflicts occur because the positive or negative relationships among NFRs are not always clear and obvious. These relationships might change depending on the meaning of NFRs within the system being developed. This paper focuses on the application of ontology in managing the relative conflicts among NFRs, particularly the relative conflicts between security and usability requirements. The aim is to develop a framework to identify, characterize, and define corresponding resolution strategies for the security-usability conflicts. This paper thus describes the sureCM framework to manage these conflicts; summarizes the security-usability conflicts ontology; and demonstrates how the ontology will be used as a basis to assist analysts in managing conflicts between security and usability requirements.},

This paper describes the development and use of an ontology to quickly prune the conceptual design space for cyber-physical systems engineering. The Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory, Metamorph Inc., and Raytheon refined an approach originally piloted on amphibious ground vehicles to determine whether it could be generalized to other product domains. Reducing the design space early in the engineering life cycle enables designers to focus quickly on high-value alternatives to reduce cost and speed development. The OpenMETA tool suite, supported by semantic constructs for model integration, facilitates trades and analysis across the engineering disciplines, including electrical, mechanical, thermal, fluid, and cyber. The ontology developed by the authors and described in this paper provides the semantic underpinnings to encode relationships among design alternatives and quickly visualize these trades.},

  abstract={The emergence of various applications is driving the continuous development of 5G mobile networks as infrastructure. To better support real-time wireless services, the low-latency communication is the current research focus. However, the existing radio resource scheduling methods cannot guarantee the strict delay constraint of the low-latency communication. Therefore, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach of radio spectrum resource scheduling strategy is proposed, which can guarantee the low-latency constraint when spectrum resources are insufficient. The Q-learning algorithm is used to approximate the optimal goal of RL. To speed up the learning, the deep neural network (DNN) is used to train the learning parameters. Simulation results show that the strategy converges quickly and has satisfactory results for mobile networks with a high load of spectrum resources.},

The work, firstly, focuses on the identification of all the design activities along with the Pahl and Beitz's engineering design process including planning and task clarification, conceptual design, embodiment design, and detail design. Moreover, related manufacturing knowledge, which are classified into three categories such as machine, material, and manufacturing processes, for design support are also identified along with the identification process of different design activities. Then, the ontology is constructed by using the software Protege and some results are illustrated. Finally, some conclusions and future works are presented.},

The ontology of Moodle e-learning system for social network analysis will become great advantage to make measurement not only based on the matrix or number of interactions but also based on the semantic meaning of the relationships among users.},

  abstract={A new approach for the understanding and shaping of the evolution of large scale socio-technical systems is presented. A proof-of-concept knowledge application has been developed, based on the industrial Rotterdam-Rijnmond case. The knowledge application includes the design of a model of industry-infrastructure evolution. Such networks are modeled via a system decomposition, formalization in an ontology and implementation of an agent based model. In simulation runs several network metrics are presented. The results provide insights in real world system behavior and show the validity and potential of the approach},

  abstract={Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has mobilized the world since the beginning of 2020, and is still globally disturbing our lives. Its diagnosis being usually unclear for doctors, patients are considered as positive cases by default, entailing a costly treatment. It was established that CXR images, i.e., those obtained by chest X-rays, are efficient in COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, automating the CXR image processing for early disease diagnosis is crucial for radiologists. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, used to discriminate between positive and negative cases. In addition, the flip, rotation, zoom and shift operations were used to augment the dataset size. Finally, the model was trained and tested on COVIDx CXR-2 dataset. The respective percentages were: 96.75 for accuracy, 96.99 for precision, 96.50 for recall, 96.98 for sensitivity, 96.52 for specificity and 96.74 for F1-score; which compare very well with state-of-the-art models.},

  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={In research, there are more and more successful approaches to operate production plants more resource-efficiently and more productively with the help of reinforcement learning. An important point is the reduction of the energy demand of production plants. Instead of manually implementing complex standby strategies rigidly in a PLC, an intelligent system can train to derive decisions about the optimal energetic state of each component autonomously. Since learning in a virtual environment has decisive advantages, simulation models with sufficient accuracy are necessary. Many of the previous implementations of reinforcement learning approaches in an industrial environment are usually tailored to a specific plant. In particular, the agent's scope of action and its connection to the environment must be adapted manually for a new plant. The presented solution shows an intelligent system which automatically optimizes the virtual learning environment with the support of plant knowledge and adapts the reinforcement learning agent to the respective production plant.},

  year={2006},
  volume={},

  abstract={Product development environments are known for their growing complexity, especially if they are envisioned for the whole product lifecycle. The objective of the PLM business activity is to manage products across their lifecycles, from cradle to grave. PLM is focused on the product, and holistically brings together many product-related components. For such environments, ontologies could play an important role to ensure semantic interoperability and correct information exchange. But what kinds of ontologies are best suited to fulfil this task. The work presented in this paper overviews some of the prominent ontologies used in product development and explores the usefulness of some typical known ontologies for PLM needs. The ontologies are assessed with respect to some ontology engineering and PLM key criteria. By identifying positive and negative aspects with respect to the previous criteria, we clarify the range of alternatives in creating an ontology devoted to PLM purposes.},

  abstract={Accurate estimation of the total project cost is important for project management. It can help an organization analyze the feasibility of a project and reduce the risk of project failure. In this paper, an ontology-based intelligent estimation agent, including a CMMI-based project planning ontology and a fuzzy cost estimation mechanism, is proposed for the total project cost estimation. The proposed agent combines the fuzzy inference, capability maturity model integration (CMMI), and the ontology to make cost estimation of the project. Based on the information stored in the CMMI-based project planning ontology predefined by domain experts, the fuzzy cost estimation mechanism infers the total project cost and stored the results to the project estimation repository. The simulation results show that the proposed agent is feasible to estimate the total project cost.},

However, existing analysis and design approaches use a narrower concept, which focuses on either knowledge, business or service aspects, neglecting to consider the stakeholders' value. In this paper, the framework of smart manufacturing systems based on the sustainable added value of stakeholders is presented. It has been suggested that reflecting upon stakeholders’ value may bring a better understanding of analyzing the SMSs paradigms.},

  abstract={In reflecting on the philosophy of engineering education as a distinct field, questions from other fields of philosophy are encountered. Among these, in addition to philosophy of education, are: ethics, epistemology, ontology, philosophy of science, and philosophy of technology. Within the philosophy of technology, a discussion of ldquophilosophy of engineeringrdquo has been pursued in recent years. In this paper, the areas described and questions raised by philosophy of technology, specifically philosophy of engineering will be briefly presented. The importance of philosophy of technology for the philosophy of engineering education will be developed. In Teaching About Technology (2005), Marc J. de Vries identified four reasons for engineering educators to become acquainted with philosophy of technology. The reasons are: (1) philosophy of technology can yield insights into curriculum development, (2) it can provide a conceptual basis for understanding technology, (3) it helps position the teaching of engineering among other subjects, and (4) it is helpful in identifying the research agenda in engineering education. Included in this paper will be a discussion of the literature in the discipline of philosophy of technology.},
