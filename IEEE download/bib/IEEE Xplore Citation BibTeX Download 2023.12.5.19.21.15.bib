  abstract={This article focuses on the implications of digital technologies (DTs) for the technology management (TM) discipline. This article explores DT-induced changes through the lens of the widely used TM framework, where TM is a dynamic capability consisting of activities developing and implementing technologies as a source for competition. The findings help to offer an expansion of the TM framework in three major ways: 1) inclusion of orchestration as a new TM capability/activity, 2) integration of TM activities across multimodal stakeholder interactions, and 3) emphasis on the critical role of TM professionals in carrying out TM activities. The proposed expanded version of the TM framework aims to provide a basis for future theoretical and applied research to advance understanding of the TM discipline.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are high-integration systems which integrate computing, communication and physical process. CPS achieves the perception of external environment by means of all kinds of networks and wired/wireless sensors. Also, the system implements real-time control through feedback mechanism. The basic perception features and applications about CPS are described. The main purpose of this work is to introduce some advanced control technologies in CPS, such as event-Based control, networked control, and distributed multi-agent control. Then, we make a relative analysis on the issues and challenges for the existing technologies, and give an outlook for the future development.},

  abstract={How to deal with the collaboration between task decomposition and task scheduling is the key problem of the integrated manufacturing system for complex products. With the development of manufacturing technology, we can probe a new way to solve this problem. Firstly, a new method for task granularity quantitative analysis is put forward, which can precisely evaluate the task granularity of complex product cooperation workflow in the integrated manufacturing system, on the above basis; this method is used to guide the coarse-grained task decomposition and recombine the subtasks with low cohesion coefficient. Then, a multi-objective optimieation model and an algorithm are set up for the scheduling optimization of task scheduling. Finally, the application feasibility of the model and algorithm is ultimately validated through an application case study.},

  abstract={The emergence of intelligent economy is a subversive change in human society. The current field of education has gradually become a practical field of real-time interaction and integration between virtuality and reality. Digital Twin has the characteristics of virtual and real symbiosis, high virtual simulation, high real-time interaction and deep insight, etc., and its application trend also extends from the industrial field to the field of education. With the revolutionary upgrade of computing efficiency, connection and display technology, the integration of digital world and physical world has been promoted, and the holographic classroom with the morphological characteristics of "visual 3D learning space" has been jointly created. In this paper, the characteristics of digital twin technology are analyzed, and the characteristics and application forms of holographic classroom are discussed. Finally, the application prospect of holographic classroom is given, which is mainly reflected in: sublimating learning space, optimizing distance learning process, helping maker and innovation education, boosting vocational education, promoting scientific management and control of teaching facilities, and improving the level of dynamic evaluation of teaching. The prospective research based on holographic classroom is of great significance to effectively promote the reform and reconstruction of learning space and learning mode under the new technology enabling in the "intelligent +" era.},

  abstract={A perennially interesting research topic in the field of visual analytics is how to effectively develop systems that support organizational users' decision-making and reasoning processes. The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems. We validate the soundness of our framework with two visual analytics systems, namely Entity Workspace [8] and PatViz [37].},

  abstract={Recognizing activities has become increasingly relevant in many application domains, such as security or ambient assisted living. To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.},

  pages={283-290},
  abstract={Over the past decade, the market size of connected wellness devices has grown in an exponential fashion. This trend is due to the advent and affordability of connected wearables and activity trackers. While users see in these health and wellness devices opportunities to nurture a culture of health and wellbeing, several hurdles still exist towards developing this culture. Wearable technologies companies have built closed-gated ecosystems around their products, preventing them to resonate with the clinical guidelines and best practices. Thus, users of these wearables find themselves torn apart between two drastically different environments; The medical healthcare environment and the wellness environment. In this paper, we explore the efforts already done to bridge that gap by analyzing the available health solutions. From this analysis, we draft guidelines for an integrated health and wellness ecosystem. These proposed guidelines focus on the Human-IoT Interaction aspect as an important cornerstone in the success and sustainability of the health and wellness program. These guidelines will also account for scalability and compatibility depending respectively on the advancement of medical practices and technologies available.},

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology for building a consensus among the stakeholders based on the level of importance of each evaluation criterion to choose the best final design, approach, or solution for a project. The proposed methodology adopts an improved vague set minimum-cost consensus model (MCCM) and a modified Delphi method. This paper discusses several shortcomings of the traditional MCCM and the Delphi method. It argues that humans' resistance to change based on a numerical rating scale follows a natural logarithm pattern instead of a linear or quadratic pattern as claimed in other studies. Hence, the traditional MCCM needs to be revised accordingly. In addition, an experiment was concluded to compare the proposed consensus-building methodology with the traditional Delphi method. The experiment showed that the proposed methodology is better than the traditional Delphi method regarding using fewer rounds to reach a consensus. At last, this paper applies the proposed methodology to the field of road junction design selection.},

  abstract={For companies, knowledge is the central and decisive resource for success. Today, however, knowledge must flow more than ever before in order to meet the requirements of shorter innovation cycles and an increasingly agile working environment. The distribution and generation of knowledge requires a digital workplace environment that facilitates communication and collaboration between employees and their environment. The digital workplace acts as both a technical enabler and an attractive feature, thus making a major contribution to organizational performance and recruiting, retaining and motivating staff. Such an infrastructure, which connects users, makes them capable of working ubiquitously. Due to the complexity and ambiguities of such an endeavour it can only be rolled out and developed on an ongoing basis in close interaction with users. Therefore, this contribution proposes an agile framework for large-scale end-user participation in developing digital workplace environments based on an agile design approach that actively and continuously involves employees.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The article deals with the problems of emotional infection of the stakeholders of the innovation SMART Government project in a crisis. In the process of managing innovative projects, managers try to model creative behaviour and are based on creative technologies. Emotional infection is considered as a social and psychological mechanism of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the innovative project, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect the effectiveness of management. The main object of creative technology is the manager or group, and the task was to educate, educate and create the organization of new behaviour in adverse, deadly and aggressive external conditions. In times of crisis, the emotional behaviour of the project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model for managing innovative projects. Examples of changes in the competence of the manager and the project team in the case of a wall and asthenic emotions are given.},

  abstract={Federated satellite systems (FSS) consist of heterogeneous spacecraft with opportunistic data services. FSS membership is based on voluntary participation by independent actors without the centralized control required for systems engineering methods. New approaches must be developed to identify and assess mechanisms and incentives for collaborative behaviors required in a FSS. Towards this goal, this paper develops an interactive tabletop board game to demonstrate a technical simulation model integrated inside a social decision-making activity. Although simplified in technical detail, the game achieves a level of realism by basing its structure and behavior on a logical model of FSS with hierarchical federation, federate, system, and subsystem constructs. A prototype game provides a physical form using a game board, mats, tokens, counters, and cards to represent key constructs. Play-testing sessions reveal insights regarding FSS including participation based on minimizing opportunity cost, legacy hardware as a barrier to participation, partnerships to overcome the initial actor problem, and frequent under-estimation of network complexity and robustness.},

  abstract={One of the significant challenges of care transitions in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is the lack of effective support tools for outgoing clinicians to find, filter, organize, and annotate information that can be effectively handed off to the incoming team. We present a large display interactive multivariate visual approach, aimed towards supporting clinicians during the transition of care. We first provide a characterization of the problem domain in terms of data and tasks, based on an observation session at the University of Illinois Hospital, and on interviews with several biomedical researchers and ICU clinicians. Informed by this experience, we design a scalable, interactive visual approach that supports both overview and detail views of ICU patient data, as well as anomaly detection, comparison, and annotation of the data. We demonstrate a large-display implementation of the visualization on an existing anonymized ICU dataset. Feedback from domain experts indicates this approach successfully meets the requirements of effective care transitions.},

  abstract={The use of social media has become pervasive across many aspects of our lives. We now depend on social media platforms more than ever before. Our dependence on social media has created a greater demand for a higher quality of service, but also for this quality to apply in new areas. As the social media experience and “real world” experience merge, there is an increased expectation that the norms of society will also apply in social media settings. There is an increasing demand for social media platforms to empower users with tools to report hate speech and other forms of dangerous content. There is also an increasing demand for greater quality of service in the way these reports are managed. The approach of social media companies to this problem, which is to largely avoid the issue by not publishing the data needed to assess the relevant quality of service, is being overcome by third party solutions. This paper discusses one such solution which is currently under development, as well as some of the challenges to improving quality of service in this area.},

  abstract={The users of the World Wide Web produce data continuously. This happens in varied areas such as trading on line, product ratings, support and use of services, and many more, comprising Distance Education. The ever increasing amount of such data can make analysis and extraction of meaningful information progressively harder, and sophisticated analysis techniques are to be used to extract added value from data. Many companies do collection and analysis of data with the purpose to develop their marketing strategies. In the field of education, and Distance Education in particular, data collected through online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can provide a great resource, and a strong challenge, for the analysis of learning processes, the design of training paths, and the updating and personalization of learning environments. While, on the one hand, there is an increasing demand by educational institutions to measure, demonstrate, and improve the results achieved in distance learning, on the other hand the logic of traditional reporting included in LMS platforms does not satisfy that growing need. Learning Analytics is the answer to the need for optimization of learning through the techniques of analysis of data produced by learning processes, involving all stakeholders of the system. In this paper we show and discuss a brief state of the art of models of Learning Analytics presented in the literature.},

A major challenge thereby is that project consortia need to establish a distributed developer community that effectively and resource-efficiently aligns development efforts with the goals and needs of complex societal constellations beyond project lifetime. In this paper we extract empirical evidence from longitudinal studies in two large-scale research projects to outline typical challenges in such problem contexts and to develop an open source software engineering methodology for research projects, including supportive infrastructure and social instruments of community building and awareness. We thus contribute a comprehensive strategy preparing collaborative research projects for sustainable societal software engineering.},

  pages={114975-115006},
  abstract={Sustainable development is crucial to securing the future of humanity. Blockchain as a disruptive technology and a driver for social change has exhibited great potential to promote sustainable practices and help organizations and governments achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Existing literature reviews on blockchain and sustainability often focus only on topics related to a few SDGs. There is a need to consolidate existing results in terms of SDGs and provide a comprehensive overview of the impacts that blockchain technology may have on each SDG. This paper intends to bridge this gap, presenting a tertiary review based on 42 literature reviews, to investigate the relationship between blockchain and sustainability in light of SDGs. The method used is a consensus-based expert elicitation with thematic analysis. The findings include a novel and comprehensive mapping of impact-based interlinkage of blockchain and SDGs and a systematic overview of drivers and barriers to adopting blockchain for sustainability. The findings reveal that blockchain can have a positive impact on all 17 SDGs though some negative effects can occur and impede the achievement of certain objectives. 76 positive and 10 negative linkages between blockchain adoption and the 17 SDGs as well as 45 factors that drive or hinder blockchain adoption for the achievement of SDGs have been identified. Research gaps to overcome the barriers and enhance blockchain’s positive impacts have also been identified. The findings may help managers in evaluating the applicability and tradeoffs, and policymakers in making supportive measures to facilitate sustainability using blockchain.},

  year={2017},

  pages={332-341},
  abstract={Prioritizing requirements is a crucial ingredient of successful Requirements Engineering (RE). The popular prioritization techniques assume that stakeholders are known and can be mandated to contribute to the prioritization process. This prerequisite no longer holds for many of today's systems where significant stakeholders (end-users, in particular) are outside organizational reach: they are neither known nor can they be identified among the members of the involved organizations. Classic techniques for involving these stakeholders such as polls or questionnaires are neither interactive nor collaborative, which is detrimental for prioritization. Social media enable collaborative prioritization, but fall short in motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to participate voluntarily. In this light, we are developing the Garuso platform, which combines social media with gamification for motivating stakeholders. While first approaches to employing gamification in RE are promising, research is still in its infancy. Especially, little is known about the influence of the gamification algorithms controlling single game elements on the stakeholders' activities. In this paper we report on a field experiment in which we investigated this influence with Garuso. We found statistically significant differences between different algorithms controlling single game elements on the contributions of stakeholders to the prioritization of requirements.},

  abstract={Prioritization of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and renewal interventions is a key issue for policy making at the urban level. This paper aims at involving citizens in the urban degradation survey process, in order to support strategic decisions of the public administration, through a streamlined process. This contribution belongs to a wider research, aiming at providing a more inclusive approach also in design and use phase of public spaces and assets. Therefore, it has been developed a web-based decision making platform fostering community participation, conceived as a modular system involving both technical surveys on physical urban degradation and perceived urban degradation assessment provided by citizens. The scope of the research concerns the involvement of citizens in urban O&M and regeneration prioritization, through advanced IT tools. The methodology exploits the functionalities of web-based survey tools feeding a digital district model: a modular information system employed as the participation platform among different stakeholders involved in the prioritization of operations in the urban environment. Data are stored and managed thanks to a Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) jointly with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Outputs are thematic maps, used by the public administration to make strategic decisions on how to invest for improvement of urban deficiencies. In this paper is presented the possibility to integrate the technical survey module, with the community involvement module. In conclusion can be stated that, the proposed methodology is a useful framework for implementation of strategies for improvement of urban quality, involving citizens' participation. Moreover, partially automates andfosters the selection of most relevant precincts where to implement interventions.},

To enable this type of analysis, we introduce a novel topology-based spatial similarity measure, T-SSIM, and a predictive algorithm based on this similarity measure. We couple the algorithm with a visual steering interface that intertwines visual encodings for the spatial data and statistical results, including a novel parallel-marker encoding that is spatially aware. We report quantitative results on a cohort of 165 patients, as well as a qualitative evaluation with domain experts in radiation oncology, data management, biostatistics, and medical imaging, who are collaborating remotely.},

  abstract={Edge computing can provide high bandwidth and low-latency service for big data tasks by leveraging the edge side’s computing, storage, and network resources. With the development of microservice and docker technology, service providers can flexibly and dynamically cache microservice at the edge side to respond efficiently with limited resources. Automatically caching needed services on the nearest edge nodes and dynamically scheduling users’ requests can realize that computing power and software services flow with the users to provide continuous services. However, achieving the goal needs to overcome many challenges, such as the significant fluctuation of user devices’ requests at the edge side and the lack of collaboration among edge nodes. In this article, dynamic computing power scheduling and collaborative task scheduling among edge nodes are comprehensively developed. The problem is considered a multiobjective optimization problem, including sequentially minimizing the deadline missing rate of requests and the average task completion time. We propose an adaptive mechanism for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) in the edge environment to solve this problem. It adopts the greedy decision method to schedule computing tasks to meet their deadline requirements. At the same time, it uses the best-fit method to adjust the computing resources according to the changes of users’ requests. The simulation results show that ADCS can decrease the deadline missing rate and reduce the average completion time. Compared with DSR and CoDSR, the deadline missing rate is reduced by 59.91% and 19.95%, respectively. The average completion time is decreased by 37.87% and 6.71%.},

  abstract={Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99 research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples’ experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Most papers focused on usability/theory-based or wider system experience research with a focus on Wizard of Oz and developed systems Questionnaires on usability and user attitudes often used but few were reliable or validated Thematic analysis showed nine primary research topics Challenges identified in theoretical approaches and design guidelines, engaging with technological advances, multiple user and in the wild contexts, critical research mass and barriers to building speech interfaces},

Such dependency on IT also provides certain risks [1], therefore there is a need for Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) and Information System security implementation. Many frameworks, including one of the most popular - COBIT, provides the structure and the best practice for such implementation. EGIT implementation often requires plenty of IT resources which SME lack, thus some recommendations and guidance are needed.

  abstract={The issues related to the development of cloud technologies are considered, in particular, the development and implementation of distributed information systems, which today are the most important decision in the market of information technologies. The reasons for the negative conclusion of most such projects are analyzed, the conclusion is made on the necessity of applying to these processes the technologies of project management that are sufficiently developed and effective at this time. The main tasks of the research and scientific novelty are: the classification of the impacts of the environment of projects, the construction of a conceptual model of information interaction on the basis of impacts, construction and research of a mathematical model for taking into account the impacts on the results of the creation of infocommunication systems. To determine the types of impacts on the system (projects) and determine its reaction, the authors proposed a conceptual model cube of interaction processes This made it possible to apply a method for forecasting the state of projects by the impact of changes based on the effects of the project environment, both internal and external. The analysis is carried out to study the parameters and characteristics of projects for the creation of complex infocommunication products and the main causes of project failures based on the generated classes of influences are identified. A list of top-level dynamic changes has been generated that made it possible to determine the main impacts on all components and participants of project activities.},

  abstract={To make responsible products and e-services with people and not only with specialists, a new eco-citizen vision of innovation is necessary, called e-co-innovation. In Reunion Island, we have introduced Semiotic Web as a human-centered method to manage sustainable development with ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). The signification or semiosis is the key psychological process that gives sense to e-co-innovation for making ICT usage-based research, rather than technology-based. The scene develops itself in partnership with end-users to exchange data, information and knowledge. In this sharing frame, the Living Labs (LL) concept allows to emphasize the importance on political and methodological principles to practice open innovation guided by usages. On more pragmatic, scientific and technical plans, we have set up a conceptual method for making products/services based on Sign management, and a tool called the Creativity or Co-design platform, used to build iteratively e-services with pilot users (lead-users). These resources have been applied for ten years at University of Reunion Island (UR) to help to manage tropical biodiversity (coral reefs and forests) and develop instrumental e-learning in music (guitar and piano) in order to satisfy the desires of target users in the domain of education by Teaching and Learning (TL).},

  abstract={Agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are critical in our society. Proper management of AFSCs is crucial for improving social welfare. Over the past years, digitization in AFSCs has emerged as a new paradigm. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing approach, providing a huge amount of information to manage AFSCs. Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine extensive studies on IoT-based AFSC. Our research starts with the identification of 346 articles in the relevant field from the Web of Science (WoS) database by applying rigorous filtration. Using the VOS viewer software, a network analysis has been performed. With seven identified clusters, this article recognizes the role of IoT technologies as Cluster 1: agri-food safety, traceability and sustainability; Cluster 2: AFSC sustainability; Cluster 3: AFSC performance measurement; Cluster 4: AFSC resilience in disruption; Cluster 5: AFSC integration and traceability; Cluster 6: AFSC transparency and coordination, and finally Cluster 7 identifies the barriers in IoT adoption. Thus, findings of this study offer robust guidance to link IoT technologies and AFSCs together. Based on these findings, propositions are proposed and a research framework is established. We believe the findings would help engineering managers, researchers, and government regulating bodies better plan and manage AFSCs for social good.},

  abstract={Lifecycle and effective dada management has become and still remains a difficult task in architecture, engineering, and construction domain. Recently, the emerging Building Information Modeling (BIM) gains more and more momentum in construction data presenting, processing, and sharing. With precise 3D digital geometry graphs, BIM has the potential to integrate diverse data from construction phases (design, construction, maintenance) and therefore becomes a promising collaboration platform for involved personnel. High efficiency BIM model processing is one of the critical issues for construction industry to truly embrace BIM technology. However, this topic has been rarely studied compared with other issues in BIM research. This paper presents an augmented version of MapReduce (MR), the popular distributed parallel computing model, to solve this problem. The main contribution lies in two points: 1) BIM models are extracted into uneven partitions according to construction domain features, followed by a specifically designed pre-process mechanism, which solves the unsuitability of classical MR's even blocking in construction domain and further greatly improves performance; 2) process and thread level parallel computing techniques are introduced into MR in single node to form a two-tier hybrid parallel architecture, which is more adaptive to BIM's massive graphical data processing. The proposed framework has been successfully used in real business applications of project quantity computation and BIM model collision detection. Experiment result from lab environment proves its efficiency and usability.},

  abstract={In the context of Digital Transformation, organizations need to react in a flexible manner to rapidly changing markets and disruptive technologies. Customer and user satisfaction are important in order to succeed. Agile User Experience (UX) Design and Lean User Research enable the organization to focus on the needs of its customers and users. The objective of this paper is to investigate the best practices that exist for user research in agile product development. In particular, we want to answer the following question: What impact does Lean User Research have and how is it conducted in industry? We have carried out several studies to answer our questions. First, we created the pattern Lean User Research by means of a systematic pattern mining process. Next, we gathered quantitative data by means of a questionnaire study. This was followed by the collection of qualitative data in a panel discussion with experts from academia and industry. The results reveal that Agile has an impact on how user research is conducted because of the speed of agile product development. In addition, we provide best practices of Lean User Research and show how they are applied in industry by giving practical examples. Moreover, we found that the UX community values the aspects of Lean User Research as important, but do not constantly apply it in their practical work. We can conclude that people have to experiment and adapt the best practices of Lean User Research to their special contexts as well as develop an agile mindset.},

Analysis of the literature demonstrates that IS researchers perceive the values of research subjects in their language, attitudes, design, and practices. They also materialize values at different temporal points in the research process. These materialization choices are largely independent of research method, and are an important research design consideration. Conceptualizing the materiality of values can enable values researchers to be explicit about methodological choices regarding the observation of values.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of new and improved sensors for military and civilian vehicles, the challenges for integrating the sensors, retrieving and processing data from them have become more complex. Typically, these sensors come with APIs as specified by the manufacturer and hence integrating newer sensors on the existing and newer platforms as well as interoperability with other platform sub-systems is highly taxing. Also, these sensors open the realm of possibilities for further automation of vehicles. Types and levels of automation are a big challenge as to how much automation is possible and should be allowed, and how to effectively use the sensors for automation and informing the vehicle crew. The NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) proposes an open architecture approach to land vehicle platform design and integration and standardises the interfaces and protocols for military vehicle systems integration. However, the NGVA does not specify any feedback mechanisms exploiting the available sensor data to support the vehicle crew. In this paper, we present a simple crew assistance system which integrates NGVA-compliant sensors and includes an adaptable rule-based interface for sensor data processing. This crew assistance system takes into consideration human factors such as human cognitive and physical workload and informs the crew members about ongoing critical events derived from available sensor data using visual, audio and haptic feedbacks in the form of alarms to increase their Situational Awareness by raising alarms on detection of specific events and making intelligent future predictions.},

The guidelines are related to the methodology of value-sensitive design and the need to actualise human values as acritical supra-functional requirement of future socio-technical systems.},

  abstract={Today more, more Web services are exposed to developers through public APIs (API-fication), enabling the spread of new services which create value for end users. The number of these services is expected to grow in the coming years. This will complicate the user experience due to the complexity required to figure out which of the available services are the most relevant and, also, the need for a user to install a different application (or to browse a specific Web page) for each service of interest. In this article, we introduce a method to determine in real-time the context of a user by leveraging on information gathered from both his personal devices (e.g., his smartphone, tablet and/or smart watch), his social accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). This allows to identify the physical context of the user (position, motion), his logical context (preferences, personal data). We then propose an algorithm which, starting from this contextual information, enables the discovery, the selection of the most appropriate services for a user according to his context. In addition, we have developed a single Android application to dynamically create a graphical user interface for each of the discovered services. This approach improves the user-service interaction providing a common user experience which does not depend on the type of service.},

We formalize the proposed collaborative architecture as a game between defenders and attackers and transform the hard problem of heterogeneous collaboration into an easier problem of finding two functions that are used in the game-theoretical model to specialize the detection mechanisms on a specific type of malicious activity. The collaboration of such more specialized IDS nodes covers much wider range of attack classes, allowing the collaborating system to maximize the overall network security awareness. We have evaluated the proposed concept on real networks, where we have shown considerable improvements in the detection capabilities of intrusion detection devices thanks to the proposed collaboration model.},

When quickly developing a first impression of future UIs, designers, engineers, and domain experts use sketches to gain a common understanding of layout and dialog flows. Although multi-touch gestures have gained importance in recent years, tools for sketching gesture-based applications lack support for custom gestures and typically just integrate a basic predefined gesture set. We demonstrate how UIs based on custom gestures can be developed in an augmented team room equipped with wall-sized interactive displays using formal gesture description and recognition techniques integrated in storyboards and UI sketches.},

  abstract={Optical engines co-packaged with switching Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) can offer a solution for advancement in bandwidth requirement and are potentially the ultimate direction for the long-touted "optical integration" era. This paper proposes a novel signal integrity (SI) design methodology for package of co-packaged optics (CPO) by using channel operating margin (COM) as a figure of merit (FOM) for the first time. The conventional design method of SI based on individual criteria, such as masks for loss, crosstalk, jitter, eye width/height, impedance, etc., are no longer able to be satisfied at the same time for current high-speed signals up to 50Gbps and even over 100Gbps. COM, combining most of the individual criteria into a single value of signal to noise ratio, provides the possibility to estimate the quality of the channel and achieve a balance between performance and design complexity in the early design stage. In this work, a design methodology in a format of a visible map using the most two significant factors, loss, and crosstalk, to satisfy the required COM is discussed in detail. With this novel methodology, one can predict the SI performance of a package in the early design stage when the real layout has not generated yet for full-wave simulation and can avoid the costly iteration in the conventional design concept.},

  abstract={This paper describes an investigation into value-based software engineering and proposes a comprehensive value taxonomy with interpretation of design feature implications. The value taxonomy is used to assess the design of Covid-19 symptom tracker applications, contrasting the UK's NHS phase 1 and 2 designs which adopted centralized, then decentralized, architectures. The value/ feature analysis is also applied to the King's/Zoe Covid app which does not detect proximity, instead relying on user self-reporting. Value analysis illuminated design choices but was insufficient to account for download acceptance of the apps. We argue that motivational cost-benefit analysis needs to complement a values-based approach.},

  abstract={Global energy systems are transforming from fossil fuels to renewables, but the conventional electricity systems are so fragile that could lead to negative consequences such as soaring prices, rolling blackouts, security issues and delays to emission reductions. Confronting to these issues, electricity systems of the future will be vastly changed, dominated by new technologies and business models, increasingly digital and highly complex. Such transformation will be enabled by means to efficiently, stably and affordably distribute electrical power from many sources and storage points. Market design, policy, regulations, legislations, cyber security and politics are barely keeping up with advances in technologies, and energy technology choices have multi-generational implications for people and economies. These issues are global and to find a solution requires true systems thinking, informed by cutting-edge research. This paper envisages interdisciplinary digitalized future energy systems for emission reductions and proposes a 6-theme template to shape the future energy system. The six research themes have been designed such that the “whole is greater than the sum of the parts”. Each theme is informed by the others and the inter-linking of the six themes’ inputs and outputs will drive the outcomes and impacts of future energy systems.},

  abstract={Learning to playa music instrument is a complex task, requiring continuous practice and the development of sophisticated motor control techniques. The traditional model of music learning is based on a master-apprentice relationship, leading often to a solitary learning process, in which the time spent with the teacher is usually limited to weekly lessons and a long period of self-study is needed. Moreover, a large amount of time passes from the teacher's feedback and the student's proprioceptive perception while studying, requiring a big effort in developing an efficient and healthy technique. In this paper, we present our recent developments concerning an assistive and adaptive technology to help violin students overcoming all these difficulties, and developing their technique and repertoire properly and sefely. In particular, we focus on the multimodal corpus of violin performances which was collected for the purpose, and on the analysis of such data to compute postural and gestural features characterizing the performance under a biomechanical perspective and in terms of movement quality. Analysis is expected to provide students with feedback for reaching a physically accurate performance, maximizing efficiency and minimizing injuries.},

  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries has long been recognized. However, the realization of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavored to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SMEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SMEs in Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporationpsilas (BSCIC) industrial estates is still in its infancy. It also identifies some significant barriers which are impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SMEs, and confidence on ICT of the SMEs in Bangladesh. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project and explores the opportunities and challenges of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SMEs in Bangladesh.},

  abstract={Exponential increases of available computational resources, miniaturization, and sensors, are enabling the development of digital musical instruments that use non-conventional interaction paradigms and interfaces. This scenario opens up new opportunities and challenges in the creation of accessible instruments to include persons with disabilities into music practice. This work focuses in particular on instruments dedicated to people who can not use limbs, for whom the only means for musical expression are the voice and a small number of traditional instruments. First, a modular and adaptable conceptual framework is discussed for the design of accessible digital musical instruments targeted at performers with motor impairments. Physical interaction channels available from the neck upwards (head, mouth, eyes, brain) are analyzed in terms of potential and limitations for musical interaction. Second, a systematic survey of previously developed instruments is presented: each is analyzed in terms of design choices, physical interaction channels and related sensors, mapping strategies, performer interface and feedback. As a result of this survey, several open research directions are discussed, including the use of unconventional interaction channels, musical control mappings, multisensory feedback, design, evaluation, and adaptation.},

  abstract={Crowdsourcing enables organizations to obtain dynamic solutions from large and diverse crowds of individuals. With the advent of IT-mediated ecosystems crowdsourcing initiatives readily possess a means to mediate, regulate and refine crowdsourcing sub processes including the process of vetting and selecting crowd membership (crowd specification sub process). Despite this fact there is ambiguity in current research as to what constitutes a crowd. Furthermore, traditional crowd selection processes show signs of limited application and are often conducted (i) once, at a fixed stage in the process and (ii) by the process initiators. This research-in-progress paper seeks to address constraints caused by the limited application of these processes. Firstly, a definition of the crowd is formulated from concepts identified in literature. Secondly, an iterative conceptual model is advanced from theory that facilitates the creation of a crowd tailored for tasks of varying size and complexity.},

  volume={9},

  pages={90919-90932},
  abstract={Aiming at the risk assessment requirements of typical industrial control systems with integrated architecture of security and safety, we propose an objective and quantitative integrated security and safety assessment scheme based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). First, we establish a safety and security integrated (SSI) architecture for typical industrial control systems with security measures integrated into safety failure modes. On this basis, we establish a hierarchical model of risk assessment with SSI failure mode as an element of the evaluation layer, and then standardize characteristic values of various safety-related heterogeneous index parameters. We design an entropy weight method that uses Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) method to modify the correlation of multiple indicators as a parameter strategy for determining the relative importance of element layer and evaluation layer and then use the membership function method of fuzzy statistical method to obtain the membership degree of hierarchical elements, and finally obtain the failure risk level value of equipment and system by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Based on a typical distributed control system, we build an experimental platform to test and verify the risk assessment plan, and compared with expert experience parameter method. The result shows that the scheme takes into account the correlation between indicators which measure the SSI risk level of industrial control system, and the entropy weight method is used to evaluate the risk of industrial control system which can overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of individual judgment. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation of system risk is completed by using fuzzy statistical method in the case of industrial control system without prior knowledge, and the idea of this scheme has a wide range of engineering value.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, electronic devices and computing systems have evolved from being rigid, complex and inflexible, to becoming highly dynamic, and responsive. While these properties have the potential to make them user friendly and human centric, they also bring about inherent drawbacks, such as user interruptions caused by a variety of system generated events. In general, interruptions cannot be eliminated and hence need to be handled since they are essential for activities such as interaction, event notification, automation, and so on. This paper discusses the fundamentals of system generated interruption and presents a comprehensive taxonomy that incorporates past and current works on interruption handling techniques and solutions. The paper also proposes a methodology and design process for the developing of interruption aware systems that are based on the use of knowledge gathered from users' preferences, surroundings and situations via information elicitation. These incorporate user based design techniques, learning mechanisms, and preference elicitation methods in order to develop models that accurately take context, user's preferences/profiles and situations into account while designing for interruption awareness},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={102290-102303},
  abstract={Global Software Development (GSD) is a widely used development practice because of various advantages offered to the customers, vendors, and other stakeholders involved in a software project development. However, GSD is not a simple process as it faces multiple challenges that arise due to the mismanagement of the communication and coordination process. Meanwhile, Requirements Change Management (RCM) is a tedious and high resource-consuming process in GSD, which is further negatively affected by the poorly managed communication and coordination mechanisms. Multiple research studies have presented various theoretical and conceptual models to overcome the challenges during RCM in the GSD context. However, the current methodologies lack in handling the communication and coordination challenges during the RCM process in the GSD context. In the literature, the researchers have concluded that a conceptual model can effectively reduce the communication and coordination challenges during RCM in GSD. Inspired by this, the current work aims at proposing a conceptual model to overcome and mitigate the communication and coordination challenges, while ensuring the effective requirement changes at offshore software development sites. Moreover, it would help multiple stakeholders in understanding and managing the necessary resources before initiating the RCM process. To validate the proposed conceptual model, we have conducted a questionnaire-based survey to procure the results from the industrial experts working in the GSD domain. After analyzing the obtained results, we found that the proposed conceptual model is effective to handle the communication and coordination challenges up to 87%. In addition, almost 87% of the experts have agreed upon the correctness, identified challenges, and the mitigation practices in the proposed conceptual model necessary to improve the RCM process in the GSD context. Furthermore, it was observed that 75% of the experts also agreed upon the practical implementation of the proposed conceptual model in the software development industry to observe the heuristic performance of the proposed conceptual model.},

The research is focused on embracing the new possibilities of this technology, enabling to track the user's interactions in much immersed and interactive environment. This shift from pure observation of the environment to interaction with it allows us to better undrestand the user's space perception and decision making. During the experiment users were observed in the virtually modeled, well-known architectural icon, Barcelona Pavilion by Mies van der Rohe. The installation took place at computational design festival Sensorium in Bratislava and examined the concept of virtuality and reality as two opposites. Users were invited to take photographs in this pavilion, which reflected on recording the most interesting motives. Case studies focused on possibilities of using VR as a tool of analysis and design. Data gathered from user motion tracking and taken photographs were analyzed and evaluated to explore relations between motion and motivation in virtual space and relations in behavioral patterns of users to support the concept of movement in space as crucial aspect of space perception.},

However, many tasks in disaster response can put the public in harm's way or introduce problems of liability. Furthermore, some human computation tasks are disconnected from the true needs of emergency response. In this paper we discuss the case of an important lost-and-found task -- reuniting displaced pets with their owners after a disaster. We argue why this task is a strong candidate for human computation by "digital volunteers."

  abstract={International development banks provide low-interest loans to developing countries in an effort to stimulate social and economic development. These loans support key infrastructure projects including the building of roads, schools, and hospitals. However, despite the best efforts of development banks, these loan funds are often lost to fraud, corruption, and collusion. In an effort to sanction and deter this wrongdoing and to ensure proper use of funds, development banks conduct extensive, costly investigations that can take over a year to complete. This paper describes a proof-of-concept of a fully automated fraud, corruption, and collusion classification system for identifying risk in international development contracts. We developed this system in conjunction with the World Bank Group - the largest international development bank - to improve the time and cost efficiency of their investigation process. Using historical monetary award data and past investigation outcomes, our classifier assigns a “risk score” to World Bank contracts. This risk score is designed to enable World Bank investigators to identify the contracts most likely to lead to a substantiated investigation. If implemented, our automated system is predicted to successfully identify fraud, corruption, and collusion in 70% of cases.},

  abstract={Software Design Patterns (SDPs) are core solutions to the recurring problems in software. However, adopting SDPs without taking into account their value implications may result in breach of social values and ultimately lead to user dissatisfaction, lack of adoption, and financial loss. An example is the airline system that overcharged people who were trying to escape from the Hurricane Irma. though not intentional, overlooking social values in the design of the airline system resulted in a significant dissatisfaction and loss of trust. To mitigate such value breaches in software design we propose explicitly taking into account social values in SDPs. To achieve this, we outline a collaborative framework that allows for (i) specifying the value implications of the SDPs, (ii) developing or extending SDPs for integrating social values, (iii) providing guidance on the value-conscious adoption of design patterns, (iv) collecting and analyzing insights from collaborators, (v) maintaining an up-to-date library of the valufied design patterns, and (vi) incorporating lessons learned from the real-world adoption of valuefied design patterns into the proposed framework for its continuous improvement in integrating social values into software design.},

The framework applies a user-centered design process that is especially sensitive to the complexity of the illness, the difficulty of treatment, its stigma, and the goals of patients and clinicians. We describe our application of this framework to designing a persuasive mobile phone monitoring system. We discuss how our use of the framework can help overcome the special challenges posed by designing systems for mental illness: (1) accommodating a complex array of symptoms, (2) supporting an uncertain treatment process, and (3) maintaining a high level of sensitivity to the seriousness and darkness of the illness, as well as the social stigma associated with it.},

  abstract={For electrified transportation (eTransportation) systems, multi-phase motors can provide higher performance and reliability than three-phase ones, but also bring more challenges in their optimal design and control. In this article, a set of high reliable electric drive system based on dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (DTP PMSM) is developed for auxiliary systems in eTransportation field. A digital collaborative develop process is proposed with the support of multiple software tools. Design, manufacture, and bench testing stages of the DTP PMSM, the two-level six-phase inverter, and the control algorithm are efficiently incorporated. A prototype of the multi-phase electric drive system is fabricated and tested. Comparison of the simulation analysis and experimental results confirms the effectiveness of the collaborative develop progress. Control algorithms based on dual d-q model and vector space decomposition model are both verified and compared via the bench test. Operation mode switching from six-phase mode to three-phase mode is also realized with the prototype system, verifying its capability in fault-tolerant and potential in efficiency optimizing.},

  abstract={At present, energy has become an indispensable part of our lives. While we are enjoying the benefits energy bring to us, we are facing challenges, such as ever-increasing energy consumption, limited energy resources, lack of robustness and resilience in response to unexpected disturbances, safety and security issues, costly impact on the environment and human health, and energy inequality. The transformation into the smart energy management system further aggravates these problems and introduces new challenges, such as the costly construction of smart facilities. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the energy system and the current status of the smart energy management system based on the framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart energy management system should take into consideration of the interaction between the smart energy management system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection management, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart energy management system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study enables us to improve preparedness, coordination & adaptiveness, safety, robustness & resilience of current smart energy management system and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption through hybrid, integrative & needed-based data acquisition, proactive communication and information sharing, adaptive decision making based on hierarchical knowledge level across spatiotemporal levels, human-involved and hybrid action.},

  abstract={With the emergence of Smart Cities, a large number of technologies have been developed and deployed world-wide. However, as Smart City technology is continuously growing, the question emerges of how to reasonably structure the ICT landscape in an urban environment, such that an eco-system of ICT components, involving vendors, network/service providers, small-mid-size enterprises, large-scale industry, and open source initiatives can emerge. Hence, a reference model serving as a blueprint for ICT architectures for future cities is required - similarly as TCP/IP and ISO/OSI facilitated the growth and world-wide development of the Internet and telecommunication services. The current paper proposes a methodology for structuring the ICT landscape in a city according to emerging standards for Smart Cities on European and German level, towards the facilitation of extensible and evolvable eco-system of ICT components and stakeholders for Smart Cities. After introducing the standards and the methodology, two case studies from recent research projects are presented in order to validate our approach.},

  abstract={[Context and Motivation] Before eliciting and gathering requirements for a software project, it is considered pivotal to know about concerned stakeholders. It becomes hard to elicit the actual system requirements without identifying relevant stakeholders, leading the software project to failure. Despite the paramount importance of stakeholder identification in requirement elicitation, it has been given less attention in the software engineering literature. [Method] For this purpose, we conducted a thorough Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on stakeholder identification (SI) and its methods in requirement elicitation. However, previously, a literature study on SI in the requirement elicitation was conducted. We found that no one has proposed any standard or baseline research method for stakeholder identification, stakeholder assessment, and stakeholder interaction up to date according to our knowledge. It provides an opportunity to update the current SLR on SI in requirements elicitation from 2011 till 2021 to search for a baseline methodology for the SI. For this purpose, we explored the existing literature research that involves the SI methods in requirements elicitation. [Principle Ideas/Results] Furthermore, we identify and capture seventeen research methodologies for SI, eight key stakeholders interaction methods, and ten stakeholders assessment methods in requirement elicitation. To further enhance the stakeholder identification process, we additionally identify pivotal information such as different potential stakeholder categories, stakeholder assessments methods, and stakeholder interaction methods. Also, based on the proposed SLR, we find out the existing gaps and new opportunities for SI methods in the requirement elicitation. [Contribution] These SI methodologies help requirements engineers and practitioners identify key stakeholders and efficiently improve the requirements quality. Moreover, this research study helps identify the effective practices used for the traditional and CrowdRE SI, recover consequences that can affect the effectiveness of SI, and recommend advisable SI practices to be employed in the future. This research study would help the software researchers and developers efficiently and accurately identify correct and concerned stakeholders to improve end-user satisfaction instead of considering it a self-evident task.},

  abstract={The increasingly higher and stricter requirements from the environmental directives and the end-users have made it more and more important to design products with higher upgradability that availed the producers of the possibility to extend the product lifetime, improve recycling ratio and decrease manufacturing cost. However, the changes of the requirements are unpredictable, so two approaches are provided for the producers in this research. One is to design products with lowest upgrading cost for the most possibly adopted upgrading direction. Another is to design product with the lowest average upgrading cost for all possible upgrading directions. Here, cost is determined by the replacement ratio of components when the product is upgraded, which, in turn, is decided by the assembly method and the component assembly sequence. This paper proposes a design & assessment method by employing term-rewriting method to analyze assembly method and an agent-based method to analyze assembly sequence of components},

  abstract={Could a social robot use force to prevent violence directed toward humans in its care?–Might crime be eradicated, or conversely could excessive use of force proliferate and human dignity become trampled beneath cold robotic wheels? Such speculation is one part of a larger, increasingly important question of how social robots will be expected to behave in our societies, as robotic technologies develop and become increasingly widespread. Here, to gain some insight into this topic of "robot self-defense", we proposed a simplified heuristic based on perceived risk of loss to predict acceptability, and conducted a user survey with 304 participants, who watched eight animated videos of robots and humans in a violent altercation. The results indicated that people largely accept the idea that a humanoid robot can use force on attackers to help others. Furthermore, self-defense was perceived as more acceptable when the appearance of the defender was humanoid rather than mechanical, and when the force disparity between attacker and defender was high. The immediate suggestion is that it could be beneficial to re-examine common assumptions that a robot should never harm or risk harming humans, and to discuss and consider the possibilities for robot self-defense.},

As it has been argued in mathematics education research, not only the content, but also the form in which students learn is important for mathematics learning. Particularly, an inquiry approach permeates through the mathematics curriculum of several countries around the world. Additionally, the use of technology to learn mathematics has been increasing in the last decades, requiring teachers and professionals in education to constantly explore and learn new possibilities or affordances in the classroom. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion about the possible and complex forms of interaction among students, teacher, mathematical tasks, and the electronic tablet (iPad) in an inquiry learning environment. An experience from a grade 10 classroom is used as a context to exemplify these interactions.},

It argues that combining core and transversal skills, along with case studies targeting the SDGs, is an efficient way to prepare the next generation of engineers to tackle the challenges of our society. Moreover, promoting critical and design thinking activities increases the desire of university students to put their technical knowledge and skills at the service of mankind and the planet.

  abstract={This paper describes the “SeaweedPaddock” system to profitably grow and harvest open-ocean Sargassum sp. as a sustainable source of macroalgal biomass and biofuel. The US Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) initiated the MacroAlgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Research (MARINER) program to develop technologies to eventually sustainably harvest macroalgae at 80 per dry metric ton (DMT). The University of Southern Mississippi team is characterizing an unmoored SeaweedPaddock; analyses include tow speed and energy required to avoid hazards, farm design to minimize biomass loss, economical harvesting, and nutrient supply. Initial results indicate that nighttime “smart towing” could allow the SeaweedPaddock system to produce macroalgae at full scale at costs below the ARPA-E goal provided that Sargassum grows at sufficient rates during the day after having been confined all night in a moving fence and that sufficient nutrients are made available. Cost projections for a successful, intensive, scaled system could be competitive with current prices for fossil fuels.},

This approach, contrary to complex method in the existing development environment of embedded systems, arises from need of agile methodology in latest development environment which requires time to market. Through adding a guide line of extreme programming to the advantage of co-design, the synergy effect of general process is expected. The risk management such as the cost management and the time management is suggested on the basis of PAMUX(Partitioning Methodology Using eXtreme Programming) and also the action plan such as the group organization and process establishment is suggested on the basis of the methodology which increases the reliability of partitioning. Finally, traits and case study of suggested methodology are evaluated by Lego robot project and it allows the PAMUX to add reliability.},

  abstract={Virginia Tech is in the process of an intensive restructuring of its Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, driven by an NSF Revolutionizing Engineering Department (RED) grant. As a natural first step, discussion has centered on how the curriculum can be meaningfully enhanced to go beyond a mere reshuffling of core content without tangible changes in pedagogy. Accordingly, we have adopted the threshold concept framework, initially developed by Meyer and Land, as a lens to view elements of the curriculum that are often considered “troublesome” for students to learn and are both transformative and integrative in nature. We opted to frame the discussion of threshold concepts in terms of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), the knowledge associated with communicating concepts in such a way that others — primarily students — can understand. To capture PCK, we used an instrument called a “content representation” (CoRe). This paper describes one element of our sequential qualitative investigation, which had three primary stages: an individual reflection with CoRe, a series of focus groups discussing and synthesizing the CoRes, and the development of a culminating card sort workshop. The findings from the focus groups will be presented, which include the set of big ideas and the associated threshold concepts within ECE from the literature.},

Manufacturing constraints of conventional manufacturing methods, such as geometric complexity limitations and workpiece handling, have shaped the landscape of computer-aided design tools, which are therefore not suitably adapted to design for additive manufacturing. Furthermore, computer-aided design tools require a high level of training to produce appropriate models. Augmented reality and feedback technologies pose an interesting opportunity for design for additive manufacturing, whereby the interaction with 3D models in an augmented or virtual design space can provide intuitive feedback to engineers and designers, providing fast validation of designs, parametric modelling and opportunities for training and use in both professional and amateur designer communities. This paper will explore and review the opportunities this exciting new technology provides.},

  abstract={The cloud-based computer-aided engineering (CAE) technology expands the application scope of CAE, solves the problem of uneven distribution, and improves the efficiency of the simulation resources. Consequently, various industries are turning to cloud CAE technology to design their products. However, to utilize this technology fully, we must overcome problems, such as impracticality, inability to handle complex analysis objects, poor data transmission, and compatibility, and poor industrial applicability. Based on the ASP.NET, VB.NET, and ANSYS Parametric Design Language, this paper establishes an integrated cloud CAE simulation system for industrial service applications. The system: 1) connects the dispatching manager through the network and 2) clusters the servers according to their load and usage before dispatch, thereby enabling users to access the ANSYS software remotely. The model can be built either by inputting the dimensions of the parametric model through the page or by uploading a three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) model that meets the format requirements. The material parameters and the boundary conditions also input through the page. Thus, clients can input their own parameters and analyze the server CAD. Finally, the CAE analysis results can be invoked by a page operation, saving meaningful results on the server to be accessed directly by users. The proposed simulation system serves the needs of users both quickly and efficiently. In the large-scale industrial application trials, enterprises responded favorably to the system. In particular, it properly solves the CAE analysis problems of small- and medium-sized machinery and equipment enterprises.},

  abstract={The rate-distortion optimized quantization (RDOQ) provides an excellent trade-off between rate and distortion in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), leading to inspiring improvement in terms of rate-distortion performance. However, its heavy use imposes high complexity on the encoder in real-world video compression applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on low complexity quantization techniques in HEVC, including both fast RDOQ and all-zero block detection. In particular, the fast RDOQ relies on rate and distortion models for rate-distortion cost estimation, such that the most appropriate quantized coefficient is selected in a low complexity way. All-zero block detection infers the all-zero block by skipping transform and quantization, in an effort to further reduce the complexity. The relationship between the two techniques is also discussed, and moreover, we also envision the future design of low complexity quantization in the upcoming Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present BH-ShaDe, a new software tool to assist architecture students learning the ill-structured domain/task of housing design. The software tool provides students with automatic or interactively generated floor plan schemas for basic houses. The students can then use the generated schemas as initial seeds to develop complete residential projects. The main goal of our research was to obtain evidence about whether or not such schemas can be useful to architecture students. A first prototype of the tool was evaluated with 78 students, with positive results. However, the students seemed to demand increased user participation, so they could contribute to generating better quality starting points. A second prototype was therefore implemented, allowing a higher degree of interactivity. The second prototype was evaluated with a new group of 50 students. From the two evaluations performed, it can be concluded that both versions of the tool were able to generate useful starting points (either automatically or interactively) that expedited the design process. Additionally, in the second experiment, we found that neither the nature (automatic or interactive) nor the quality of the starting point seems to have any effect on the perceived quality of the final projects.},

  abstract={The growth of eHealth has implications for a range of industries and stakeholders. In this paper we explore eHealth as a solution to the problems posed generally by rising healthcare costs and specifically by aging populations. We propose that the landscape of healthcare delivery and associated driving forces can be characterized in terms of quality, cost, and the balance of online- versus onsite healthcare delivery. Additionally, we explore how the eHealthcare value chain network can be configured to deliver both feasible and viable eHealthcare services to the end user. This paper begins by examining the context of the evolution of healthcare and is followed by an overview of the value-chain network model that we argue should underpin any business model that is developed in the pursuit of the effective delivery of healthcare. We examine some specific value drivers of eHealthcare that result in adoption and the challenges resulting in non adoption, provide case studies, discuss the technology implications, and conclude with the directions that we anticipate being of consequence in the future.},

  abstract={Considering the increasing demand for large-scale MapReduce distributed computing, coded distributed computing (CDC) has become a promising technology to reduce the significant bottleneck of MapReduce computation. Despite its importance, most of the works on CDC have assumed homogeneous environments, where the nodes have the same storage, computing, and communication capacities. However, since many practical scenarios involve heterogeneous environments, heterogeneous CDC design is highly demanded to reduce communication load. Under consideration of full heterogeneity among workers, this paper addresses the joint design of function assignment and coded shuffling to reduce communication load effectively. We first devise a new embedded index coding (EIC) solution for the device-to-device (D2D) environment and prove its optimality. By extending our novel approach, we propose the optimal shuffling design for the MapReduce framework. Then, we figure out the optimal function assignment with the optimal shuffling design. On account of the prohibitive complexity, we propose an efficient greedy search algorithm and analyze how much performance the proposed scheme can guarantee. Numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm provides the near-optimal communication load with a considerable complexity reduction, while we observe that the function assignment design is vital for heterogeneous CDC by comparing with the well-designed file allocation design.},

  abstract={How can high-level directives concerning risk, cybersecurity and compliance be operationalized in the central nervous system of any organization above a certain complexity? How can the effectiveness of technological solutions for security be proven and measured, and how can this technology be aligned with the governance and financial goals at the board level? These are the essential questions for any CEO, CIO or CISO that is concerned with the wellbeing of the firm. The concept of Zero Trust (ZT) approaches information and cybersecurity from the perspective of the asset to be protected, and from the value that asset represents. Zero Trust has been around for quite some time. Most professionals associate Zero Trust with a particular architectural approach to cybersecurity, involving concepts such as segments, resources that are accessed in a secure manner and the maxim “always verify never trust”. This paper describes the current state of the art in Zero Trust usage. We investigate the limitations of current approaches and how these are addressed in the form of Critical Success Factors in the Zero Trust Framework developed by ON2IT ‘Zero Trust Innovators’ (1). Furthermore, this paper describes the design and engineering of a Zero Trust artefact that addresses the problems at hand (2), according to Design Science Research (DSR). The last part of this paper outlines the setup of an empirical validation trough practitioner oriented research, in order to gain a broader acceptance and implementation of Zero Trust strategies (3). The final result is a proposed framework and associated technology which, via Zero Trust principles, addresses multiple layers of the organization to grasp and align cybersecurity risks and understand the readiness and fitness of the organization and its measures to counter cybersecurity risks.},

  abstract={Nowadays computers and networks are everywhere. They take different shapes varying from big electronic whiteboards to small mobile devices. Perhaps all of them have been already used to support some kind of learning activity. Although the literature claims they have been very successful supporting certain, often isolated type of learning activity they can seldom be combined with other systems to enable more consistent and comprehensive support. Researchers have already noted the necessity to develop learning methodologies and systems which can support learners along a continuous flow of different learning settings. In this paper we present a learning system and a methodology based on the use of patterns. Students learn about design and architectural patterns by finding instances of them on the field, or by recognizing new patterns unknown to them so far. This work illustrates how computer technology can support the students in a continuous way without technological or methodological disruptions.},

  abstract={In this paper we present an analysis of the variability of contactless gestures performed to control secondary functions in a car. In particular, those used to control the music player. We set up a Wizard-of-Oz experiment in a driving simulator where participants performed the gestures they think they would use to control the functions of the music player. The results of the experiment show a high level of variability in the gestures performed by different drivers for the same function. This could lead to driver distraction as well as user acceptance issues if a gesture vocabulary is `enforced' in order to use these systems. Thus, vehicle manufacturers should provide solutions to overcome these issues, such as gesture customization.},

  abstract={Computational creativity (CC) is a multidisciplinary research field, studying how to engineer software that exhibits behavior that would reasonably be deemed creative. This paper shows how composition of software solutions in this field can effectively be supported through a CC infrastructure that supports user-friendly development of CC software components and workflows, their sharing, execution, and reuse. The infrastructure allows CC researchers to build workflows that can be executed online and be easily reused by others through the workflow web address. Moreover, it enables the building of procedures composed of software developed by different researchers from different laboratories, leading to novel ways of software composition for computational purposes that were not expected in advance. This capability is illustrated on a workflow that implements a Concept Generator prototype based on the Conceptual Blending framework. The prototype consists of a composition of modules made available as web services, and is explored and tested through experiments involving blending of texts from different domains, blending of images, and poetry generation.},

  abstract={DFMA is a methodology which is used to select the optimum design in the early stages of product design. This paper deals with the modeling of pedestal fan using DFMA method. Method used for DFMA analysis is Boothroyd Dewhurst method. The aim of study is to analyse the existing design of pedestal fan and to identify the pockets of improvement and suggest the new design of pedestal fan with improved design efficiency. DFMA is a concurrent engineering tool that is used to improve the design of the product which leads to minimization of the production cost. It also shortens the product development time by reducing the number of components, increases the quality of the product as well as reduces the overall product cost by reducing the assembly cost as well as manufacturing cost. Part modelling of each component of existing design as well as improved design of pedestal fan was done with the help of design software. Increase in the design efficiency shows the easy assembly process i.e. less time taken during assembly operation of new design in comparison to the existing design.},

  abstract={Mixed-initiative decision making is a flexible and effective way for coherent manned-unmanned teamwork (MUT). It allows the autonomous adjustment of levels of autonomy (LOA) and the human-robot collaboration modes according to the task requirements as well as the states of environments, robots and the human operator. However, it is still difficult for humans and robots to understand each other's intentions and motivations due to the challenges of cognition representation and behavior reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-initiative MUT approach using coactive design and graph neural networks (GNN) towards explainable human-robot collaboration. First, an interdependence analysis table is designed for a specific manned-unmanned aerial vehicle task following the coactive design principles of observability, predictability and directablity. Then, a multi-agent dynamic task assignment system is designed based on a task model with key decision-making points. Finally, we have used the Graph Network Library to design a GNN model for adjusting the LOA among the MAV and UAVs in the given task.},

As part of this research, learners were guided into our collaborative learning system to give and receive feedback on each other's developing work. Using only data gathered from learners from the learning system about how they interact with each other, it is shown that combined activity is the best predictor of success in the course. This differentiates this research apart from many clickstream analysis studies. The results indicate the potential of predicting which of the two fail/pass bands students fall into, and analyse the predictions throughout the duration of the term.},

  pages={94994-95018},
  abstract={Large technology and software engineering programmes, such as enterprise system programmes, are increasingly implemented through a mixture of customer and specialist third-party resources. These multi-partner working environments can be thought of as a complex social system, which oftentimes experience various forms of conflict. This can be due to competing objectives and priorities of the various organizations, along with incompatibilities of team members within the work-based social network of the implementation programme. If not brought under control, conflict can lead to complex emergent behaviours and dynamics within the wider social network, which can severely impact the likelihood of successful programme implementation of these software-intensive systems. Using social network analysis and thematic coding analysis within a case study, we show that the project management of complex software-intensive implementations requires considerable focus on control and communication across the programme-wide social network of team members, which we represent as a cybernetic system. A conceptual framework has been developed that extends extant literature around conflict in teams by framing the individual projects and the overall programme-wide implementation as cybernetic systems. The conceptual framework illustrates how a cybernetics approach to conflict within enterprise system implementations, can provide new insights into how conflict develops within project teams. Finally, we argue that the cybernetic approach allows us to develop project management interventions to mitigate the risk of conflict development, or control and regulate conflict once it has developed. We conclude by setting the agenda for future research on how conflict can be controlled within the implementation of software-intensive systems, such as enterprise systems.},

  abstract={In collaborative crowdsourcing, the problem of maintaining solvers' motivation and participation plays a crucial role. It has been noticed that one of the major issues is related to the scarce capacity of novices to face expert users in finding good solutions, which leads to an high rate of community abandonment. In order to overcome such a problem the best solvers should be asked to illustrate the rationale of their solutions and to share the adopted heuristics before receiving the award. This procedure allows the less expert to learn by doing and see how best solvers innovate products. The paper presents the “You solve, I learn” approach and how it has been implemented in an original platform able to promote innovation, creativity and effective knowledge sharing. The software use and achieved results are demonstrated through a case study.},

The complexity lies in the interactions and impacts embodied in the concept of the urban-ecosystem at various governance levels. This highlights the need for more effective integrated environmental management systems. This paper offers a user-orientated approach based on requirements for an effective management of the urban-ecosystem and the potential contributions that can be supported by the cloud computing community.

  volume={40},
  number={4},
  pages={338-365},
  abstract={Decision-based processes are composed of tasks whose application may depend on explicit decisions relying on the state of the process environment. In specific domains such as healthcare, decision-based processes are often complex and critical in terms of timing and resources. The paper presents a variety of tool-supported techniques for analyzing models of such processes. The analyses allow a variety of errors to be detected early and incrementally on partial models, notably: inadequate decisions resulting from inaccurate or outdated information about the environment state; incomplete decisions; non-deterministic task selections; unreachable tasks along process paths; and violations of non-functional process requirements involving time, resources or costs. The proposed techniques are based on different instantiations of the same generic algorithm that propagates decorations iteratively through the process model. This algorithm in particular allows event-based models to be automatically decorated with state-based invariants. A formal language supporting both event-based and state-based specifications is introduced as a process modeling language to enable such analyses. This language mimics the informal flowcharts commonly used by process stakeholders. It extends High-Level Message Sequence Charts with guards on task-related and environment-related variables. The language provides constructs for specifying task compositions, task refinements, decision trees, multi-agent communication scenarios, and time and resource constraints. The proposed techniques are demonstrated on the incremental building and analysis of a complex model of a real protocol for cancer therapy.},
