  abstract={With digital technologies now being part of the fabric of our societies, identifying and managing cybersecurity threats becomes imperative. Within the European Union, several initiatives are underway, aiming to motivate, regulate and eventually orchestrate the establishment of capacity and enhancement of situational awareness, incident response, and preparedness capabilities, with an expected emphasis on operators of essential services and state actors entrusted with cybersecurity. In this context, the institution of cooperation and information exchange channels to allow for coordinated cross-border responses to large-scale incidents is particularly prioritized. Motivated by the above, this work presents a conceptual blueprint in support of architecting and establishing interoperable Cyber Security Operations Centres that combine capacity for situational awareness, incident response, and preparedness, also benefiting from the interplay between them, ultimately enhancing national cybersecurity capabilities, cross-border collaboration, and national supervision of their critical sectors, in line with current and upcoming regulatory requirements and the ever-increasing need for national and international cooperation.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel reference software architecture and supporting pattern language for an augmented reality authoring and training system. Industry-based augmented reality training is considered an essential element of the next techno-industrial revolution. These next generation learning environments allow a trainee to offload complexity and giving them live (or on-demand) feedback on their progress and performance through workplace augmentation is already being taken up by industry forerunners. This reference architecture - for wearable experience for knowledge intensive training - incorporates head-mounted augmented vision, an array of wearable sensors that monitor movement and physiological signals, a data-layer managing sensor data and a cloud-based repository for storing information about the activity and workplace. Moreover, this architecture has been tested in a range of knowledge intensive workplaces, in the aeronautic, medical and space industries. Two iterations of the architecture were developed and validated, together with over 500 participants, producing datasets on activity performance, physiological state and assessment of the platform. The components and links of the architecture are presented here as generalizable design patterns to support wider development. We then propose a pattern language for augmented reality training applications.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on a lesser studied multiparty meetings processing task of argument diagramming. Argument diagramming aims at tagging the utterances and their relationships to represent the flow and structure of reasoning in conversations, especially in discussions and arguments. In this work, we tackle the problem of automatically assigning node types to user utterances using several lexical and prosodic features. We performed experiments using the AMI Meeting Corpus annotated according to the the Twente Argumentation Schema. Our results indicate that while lexical and prosodic features both provide orthogonal information for this task, using a cascaded approach, eliminating backchannel utterances improves the performance. With this final approach, when all features are used, we achieve about 9% relatively better error rates than a simpler classifier based on only lexical features.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={401-408},
  abstract={Social agents have been mostly designed to engage with children one-on-one as tutors or learning peers. Besides this child-robot dyadic interaction paradigm, they have the potential to empower parents to more actively interact with their children. Robot-assisted parent-child interaction could be a sustainable future approach for promoting children’s in-home learning. Motivated by this new design direction, this work takes an iterative design approach to explore how we design triadic interactions through "lived technology experiences" and interviews. For 3-6 weeks, we deployed and remotely teleoperated a social robot in the homes of 12 families with 3-7-year-old children to engage in a triadic story reading activity with both parent and child for six 25-min sessions. Before and after the deployment, we conducted a semi-structured interview with participants on their triadic interaction experience and desired robot design features. The results of our qualitative analysis show that social robots can improve various aspects of parent-child interaction. We propose design guidelines for robot-assisted parent-child interactions at home, the considerations of participants’ values around technology design, and promotion of their long-term lived technology experiences as critical sources for design knowledge.},

  abstract={Good decisions require good understanding of the problem, the context and available options. This knowledge, in general, is dispersed through several, frequently unidentified, individuals. Collecting, filtering and putting together the relevant knowledge pieces to create solutions are difficult tasks. Many domains fit this scenario of distributed knowledge and creative solution's needs including governmental decision-making. Democratic governments constantly need to make sense of population demands to properly make decisions that attend overall will. However, low citizens participation in government decisions through democratic processes is an aspect that defies democracy itself. Large-scale citizens participation is difficult for the lack of technology to collect, filter and synthesize information. To deal with this problem, we developed an intelligent mobile network that allows broad citizens' participation and feasible government action. Previous research indicates cellular phones as the device with the broadest acceptance in all Brazilian social classes. Sending messages and voting by cell phones are broken barriers to consider the device as the natural input interface for citizen-government interaction. Additionally, message summarization and clusterization help government understand the demands. In this paper we present mGov, a system for eliciting and answering citizen demands in a participatory government structure. A prototype has been deployed with good results electronic},

  abstract={The College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has recently launched a new B. S. dual degree in Innovation, Leadership, and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE), a second bachelor's degree option for those completing their degree in a traditional engineering discipline. This is unlike many universities where similar degree programs are situated in colleges of business rather than engineering. The first cohort of sixteen students has joined the program in January 2017. In this paper we first report on the stated goals of the new degree, which is meant to combine the technical expertise in the traditional engineering science-focused disciplines with a deeper set of skills in problem-finding, creativity, innovation, leadership, and externalization. The idea is to ensure training in the dual physical and human dimensions and triple aspects of science, design, and leadership that are present in engineering practice. Next we report on the curriculum design as well as the experiential learning pedagogy that is present in most of the courses therein. Core courses include “Design Thinking/Need-Finding”, “Creativity, Innovation, Vision”, “Emotional Intelligence”, “Innovation and Engineering Design”, and “Technology Entrepreneurship”. Further, we provide a characterization of the students in the first cohort of undergraduate students to be accepted into the degree program. Drawing on their application materials, we perform text analytics using techniques such as topic modeling under Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and geometric embedding using the word2vec family of methods, to understand the key motivations for students to pursue this degree. Finally we use these text analytics techniques to make a formal assessment of alignment between the stated goals of the degree program and the key motivations of the students. One particular question is to understand the students' relative level of interest in the three legs of the degree, namely innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship, so as to predict how level of engagement may vary across courses.},

  abstract={Semantic integration is crucial for successful collaboration between heterogeneous information systems in an open environment. Traditional ontology-driven approaches rely on the availability of explicit ontologies. However, in many domains, this prerequisite cannot be met. In order to address this issue, this paper investigates the theoretical foundation of ontologies and extends the traditional ontology concept to an ontological view concept. To explicitly and formally specify the ontological views, a Frame-based Ontological view Specification Language (FOSL) is proposed. This language is based on the Frame knowledge representation paradigm and uses XML as the encoding. A prototype environment that supports semantic integration based on ontological views specified with FOSL is introduced.},

  abstract={Healthcare needs of individuals in rural areas differ from those in urban areas. Rural areas often lack access to proper healthcare and hence, enhancing the healthcare accessibility in rural areas must be given highest priority. This study focuses on the healthcare sector in the village of Morasiya, in Bhojpur district of Bihar (India). A team of students and faculties, as part of the Live-In-Labs® program, stayed in the village for one week to examine the health conditions of the villagers. The team probed the factors behind the alarming condition of poor health of Morasiya inhabitants, analyzed the prevailing treatment methods in Morasiya, and the services provided by the government-funded Public Health Centre. It was inferred that lack of a local health clinic, negligence towards diet and personal hygiene, and shortage of medical professionals were the main causes behind the poor health of the villagers. Co-design tools were employed to devise a solution to their health challenges. An IoT-based Amrita Smart Health Assistant (ASHA) solution was developed, which monitors and transfers data securely over MQTT to a cloud, which can be accessed and analyzed by medical professionals for remote monitoring of community health in villages.},

  abstract={The ORNL Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) provides the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and development across a broad range of disciplines. SNS experiments produce large volumes of complex data that are analyzed by scientists with varying degrees of experience using 3D visualization and analysis systems. However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve proficiency with 3D visualizations. Because 3D representations are key to understanding the neutron scattering data, scientists are unable to analyze their data in a timely fashion resulting in inefficient use of the limited and expensive SNS beam time. We believe a more intuitive interface for exploring neutron scattering data can be created by combining immersive virtual reality technology with high performance data analytics and human interaction. In this paper, we present our initial investigations of immersive visualization concepts as well as our vision for an immersive visual analytics framework that could lower the barriers to 3D exploratory data analysis of neutron scattering data at the SNS.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a whole new way for cities to deal with crises. More than ever, in order to protect the citizens, cities need to rely on data to address such a public health emergency. In this sense, the Urban Control and Command Centers (CCCs) are an important governance organism to help the monitoring and the management of the complex dynamic of contemporary cities. These centralized and integrated management structures in the form of a governmental agency can aid the decision makers into a more coordinated, systemic, strategic, and data-driven intervention. In Rio de Janeiro's case, the city Urban CCC - called Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR in the Portuguese abbreviation) - is mostly designed to monitor the daily routine of the different systems and infrastructures that compose the city's dynamic, to plan and integrate operations for big events like Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to manage emergency situations. With the monitoring center, Rio is able to identify abnormalities and make sure that any interference in the city can be resolved in a timely manner, in order to ensure that the city comes back to normal in the face of a disruption and runs as smoothly as possible. Regarding the context of the pandemic of the COVID-19, Urban CCCs can also be an important tool to manage health emergencies. In this paper, the case of the COR is presented, showing how this Brazilian city is using its Urban CCC to monitor and assist the authorities with Preal time data intelligence to respond to this unprecedented emergency.},

Achieving interoperability among e-learning infrastructures is essential for the classroom of the future. However, the field of e-learning has grown without a clear vision on how heterogeneous e-learning systems should inter-relate, and interoperability remains a big challenge. We analyze relevant standardization approaches which in turn shapes an overview of enabling technologies for e-learning.

  abstract={The objective of this research is to investigate the use of robots as intermediaries to gather sensitive information from children. The research is multidisciplinary in nature. The goals will be accomplished through the development of an integrated robotic framework that includes a novel architecture and an interactive user interface to gather information using methodologies recommended for forensic interviews with children. The Interactive Social Engagement Architecture (ISEA) is designed to integrate behavior-based robotics, human behavior models, cognitive architectures, and expert user input to increase social engagement between a human and system (e.g., robot, avatar, etc.). ISEA provides for the autonomous generation of robot behaviors for self-preservation and to convey social intelligence. The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable to different applications and domains; however for this project, the focus is on social engagement for information gathering. The interactive user interface provides interviewers with the ability to use a robot as an intermediary for gathering this information. The interface and framework have been iteratively improved through observations from user studies conducted to date with 186 children ages 8-12. This project compares the effectiveness of robot versus human interviewers to gather sensitive information from children using situations in which this would commonly occur - cases of child eyewitness memory and child reports of bullying. This research has the potential to transform how sensitive information is gathered as it relates to criminal investigations and proceedings.},

The paper introduces the context, followed by a justification from current literature, an introduction to the approach and finally a summary of the outcomes obtained by the project. In this study an authentic learning approach was followed which allowed students to propose and tender for capstone projects in a four-year engineering programme, and following a period of tender also give active input into the selection of tenders based on their personal knowledge and experience. From this process, a preference list was obtained from both students and faculty of their opinions of the best way assignments could be allocated followed by applying the Gale-Shapley algorithm to select the optimal assignment of projects to students. It is hoped that this study will inspire other educators in similar situations to consider handing over some measure of control to students during their undergraduate studies in engineering to increase the level of responsibility and thoughtful reflection experienced by students before they enter the profession.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={96-105},
  abstract={In order to obtain a holistic perspective on learning, technical infrastructure at an institutional level can be advantageous for Learning Analytics (LA). If personal data is collected and processed in such infrastructure, legal requirements are of crucial importance. Recent studies have examined various aspects of LA infrastructure, such as ethical trade-offs and stakeholder needs. However, strategies for designing technical LA infrastructure at the institutional level and strategies for dealing with data protection regulations have been lacking so far, although they are crucial for the adoption of LA in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to examine three research questions: (RQ1) which strategies are currently used to design LA infrastructure; (RQ2) how data protection and privacy affect the design of LA infrastructure; and (RQ3) how could technical measures support the adoption of LA. These research questions were investigated by conducting eleven interviews with LA infrastructure developers representing eight different higher education institutions and ten different infrastructures. According to RQ1, the paper first examines the domain specificity of LA infrastructure and the four design strategies used. The paper also examines, according to RQ2, the interviewees’ awareness of data protection, the conflict with users’ consent, and the data subject rights. Finally, the paper presents, in line with RQ3, the results of the strategies in dealing with trust, stakeholder expectations, and engagement.

  abstract={5G, in contrast to previous mobile network generations, has been conceived with vertical industries in mind. Vertical industry enterprises and other experts have identified a wide set of innovative use-cases that could take advantage of ample throughput, low network delay, widespread coverage and resilience promised by 5G technologies. However, the commercial success of an idea depends on a wide range of socioeconomic factors that call for designers, engineers, business analysts and end-users to collaborate in setting-up, running and analysing a series of experiments. In this paper we describe the “Experimentation-as-a-Service” offering of 5G-VINNI facility, a collection of 5G testbeds, and analyse its potentials and shortcomings by combining online surveys with SWOT and TOWS analysis.},

  abstract={This work focuses on the improvement of a line of corporate knowledge management systems, knowledge repositories. For the implementation of such systems, companies can deploy important means for small gains. Indeed, management services often notice very limited use compared to what they actually expect. We present a use case of a five-step re-designing user-centered approach that combines a top-down content architecture, integration with other corporate information systems and adapted interfaces and interactions design to increase the use of these artifacts. Our implementation is done on the knowledge repository used by operators from Société du Canal de Provence (SCP),a French water management company. Their system was taken into production but very occasionally used. We describe the reasons for this limited use and we propose a design methodology adapted to the context. Promoting the effective use of the system, our approach has been experimented and evaluated with a panel of users working at SCP. Results of our semi-structured questionnaire reveal that more than half of the participant are satisfied and present a positive attitude towards the re-designed system.},

  abstract={The process of designing affective technology as an assistive device needs to take ethical questions into account. Although biomusic, an affective technology, has been used effectively as an assistive communication device in the context of healthcare, its use with persons with autism in a broader context poses complex challenges. In order to understand and respond to these challenges, a 3-day workshop was organized in Montreal to gather information from stakeholders, i.e. users on the spectrum, family members and persons who work with them in educational, work, and cultural settings, on the potential uses and ethical issues of biomusic. In this paper, we report some of the outcomes of this workshop from a design perspective, which we used to generate a framework for biomusic as affective technology. This framework proposes three distinct lenses: a technological one, an ecological one, and a human-centered one. We illustrate how this framework can make visible the ethical issues that can emerge during the design process and promote collaborative and concrete solutions that respond to user concerns.},

  abstract={Robotics applications in the raw materials sector are becoming increasingly common due to their many perceived benefits. In mining, the extended use of robotics is especially seen in the exploration and exploitation phases, where mineral resources are discovered, extracted and processed. The use of robotics in the mining industry started in the 60s and today it is seen in the automation of material transport or in robotic digging and loading. Potential benefits include improved productivity, decreased production costs, better operational efficiency, increased safety, reduced waste and, ultimately, more value creation. The increasing amount of robotics used in the raw materials sector is coupled with a series of ethical and legal issues, regulatory challenges and policy requirements that affect both producers and end-users of robotic technologies. The benefits and challenges of robotics applications, often overlooked by the stakeholders, can hinder both their integration in the sector and the further development of mining activities, if not properly addressed.},

  abstract={Results from a triple-blind mixed-method user study into the effectiveness of mixed-initiative tools for the procedural generation of game levels are presented. A tool which generates levels using interactive evolutionary optimization was designed for this study which 1) is focused on supporting the designer to explore the design space and 2) only requires the designer to interact with it by designing levels. The tool identifies level design patterns in an initial hand-designed map and uses that information to drive an interactive optimization algorithm. A rigorous user study was designed which compared the experiences of designers using the mixed-initiative tool to designers who were given a tool which provided completely random level suggestions. The designers using the mixed-initiative tool showed an increased engagement in the level design task, reporting that it was effective in inspiring new ideas and design directions. This provides significant evidence that procedural content generation can be used as a powerful tool to support the human design process. support for the research of this article.},

To provide a policy framework that anchors the introduction and integration of health information technologies, a majority of World Health Organisation (WHO) member countries - both advanced and emerging economies - have developed national eHealth strategies over the last decade. However, it is not clear whether these policy frameworks take cognisance of a changing technology landscape set to be dominated by IoT, big data and other fourth industrial revolution technologies. This research examines the scope of key policy issues and the concept of eHealth as interpreted in national eHealth strategies of five countries in subSaharan Africa. To harness the potential of IoT and big data analytics in healthcare, the results demonstrate the need to re-examine the applications that define how eHealth is understood as well as a review of the strategic priorities in national eHealth strategies.},

  pages={196-202},
  abstract={Designing privacy-protecting Information Systems (ISs), i.e., realizing the Privacy by Design (PbD) principle, is a challenging task. This challenge stems from having many stakeholders and design trade-offs involved, which cause uncertainty in defining the problem, eliciting soft requirements, and making design trade-offs among many contending objectives. As creating a formal model of such settings is often infeasible, applying a conventional engineering design method alone may not result in elucidating users' needs and/or devising a viable design that is acceptable for all parties (e.g., end-users and data subjects). This contribution aims at enriching engineering approaches for privacy-protecting ISs with the so-called design-thinking approach. Design-thinking, initially used for product and service design, has been applied to the areas where there are interactions among people, organizations and technologies, in order to elucidate user needs and concerns that are insufficiently formulated and/or hidden in tacit knowledge. In this contribution, we elaborate on three main PbD components, namely problem space, solution space and mapping space. We, further, analyze the shortcomings of traditional engineering approaches for privacy protection as well as the potentials and shortcomings of design-thinking in general. Finally, we present our practical experience with applying the design-thinking approach to the problem of PbD for ISs. We foresee the applicability of design-thinking for elucidating the problem space as well as for making design trade-off among contending values in order to come up with a viable design option.},

  abstract={The greatest societal challenges are numerous, daunting, and seemingly unrelated, collectively spanning almost every discipline of science and engineering. Societies confronted with these complex challenges need to manage synergies and trade-offs across multiple systems, scales and levels of analysis. Unfortunately, if the goal is to overcome each of these challenges separately, we must embrace convergence as a means to merge disciplines, methodologies, and technologies, and we must do this for every one of the challenges, which is a truly daunting, and perhaps even impossible, task. Fortunately, however, societal challenges of the Anthropocene share the abstract common characteristics of broad scope, complex interdependencies, and multi-faceted causality, and also share several common systems. Seizing on this conceptual opportunity, we evaluate the “convergence potential” for systems-of-systems engineering methods. We then present a way forward that addresses the unique characteristics of Anthropocene systems by developing an agile systems-of-systems engineering framework and associated decision-support system to integrate fragmented data and disciplinary knowledge into a new systemic understanding. The proposed framework provides a fresh perspective on an entire family of societal challenges of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract={MindGym aims at improving the quality of life of older citizens and their caregivers by applying mind gymnastics that will keep the elderly active in vital mental shape. We plan to realize multidisciplinary research and innovation actions to achieve the following objectives: understanding the mental health conditions, preventing disruptive mental disorders and their early diagnosis, and mind gymnastic treatment. The target of this research is to influence mental conditions that lead to some mental disorders, such as depression, dementia, sedentariness, cognitive decline and personality disorders, which are present in older people, but can also be experienced earlier. The initial, understanding phase includes scanning mind activities using different audio-visual stimuli, by applying the sophisticated fMRI and EEG technologies to identify the regions of the brain that demonstrate increased activation with positive stimuli. Prevention is based on analysis and correlation of the results and will enable the development of a methodology for increasing mind activities drawing on the conclusions from experts about which audio-visual stimuli support the best mind gymnastic; as well as matching the results on various socio-economic, gender, religious, environmental and physical factors. An interactive system based on recommended audio-visual content, IPTV, social networks, cloud enabled devices and applications will be developed as a prototype tool for creating everyday mind gymnastics. Early diagnosis of mental reactions will be determined by EEG or fMRI technologies for various stimuli, enabling conditions to detect abnormal changes in the brain activity. This paper gives an overview of current research and projects in the area. It defines the basic objectives of planned MindGym research activities.},

  abstract={Despite witnessing an infinitely long list of large infrastructure projects dragging on for longer than expected, bursting the original budget, and negatively impacting stakeholders, there is no common fast-acting cure for the issue. The causes of failure are often associated with either human factors or risk management. One of the potential remedies for ensuring success for infrastructure projects of significant social impact relies on building tight collaborations. These call for experimentation with different mechanisms that have the potential to improve project outcomes and maximise end-user benefits. We consider the potential to contribute to the successes of socially impactful infrastructure projects by piecing together a range of smaller less-related projects that are funded, monitored and supported through the mechanism of cascade funding. With the assumption that the product of combined projects is more impactful than the sum of their contributions, we demonstrate a representative example of several successful use cases that, when combined, enhance the digitalization of water utilities and help maximise the impact of complex multi-faceted issues that are often entangled in large projects.},

  abstract={The purpose is to establish Mass Customization (MC)-oriented Customer Demand Response (CDR) service platform based on Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, the MC-oriented Demand Response (DR) process and the characteristics of CC are analyzed. Secondly, an MC-oriented CDR service platform system based on CC and IoT is proposed. Finally, the edge-cloud collaborative computing method is used to maintain the efficiency and stability of the CC platform, and the proposed method is compared with other state-of-art algorithms to further prove its effectiveness. The results show that the parameters  $\varphi $  and V have a significant impact on the queue size and operation cost. Compared with other methods, the operation cost of the proposed edge-cloud collaborative computing method is relatively low. Thus, the proposed edge-cloud collaborative computing method is more applicable in high-speed and low-speed data; it can also improve the resource utilization of the Data Center (DC) and reduce the operation cost. The research results provide a basis for the establishment of the MC-oriented CDR service platform.},

  abstract={The study proposes the structure of a network distributed attack detection system is two-tier: the first level provides primary analysis of individual packets and network connections by signature analysis, the second level processes aggregated network data streams using adaptive classifiers. The method of detection of anomalous network connections on the basis of hybridization of methods of computational intelligence for construction of multilevel schemes with arbitrary embedding of classifiers in each other and their passive connection in the process of analysis of the input vector is developed in the article. As a result of the signature analysis, it was found that the combination of detectors experimentally increased the detection of attacks by 1.28%. Software implementation of the proposed technique in the form of basic intelligent classifiers of network attacks can be used separately from the attack detection system in addressing the classification of attacks.},

In this study, we developed three new visualization methods for collective idea generation and innovation processes and applied them to data from online social network experiments. The first visualization is the Idea Cloud, which helps monitor collective idea posting activity and intuitively tracks idea clustering and transition. The second visualization is the Idea Geography, which helps understand how the idea space and its utility landscape are structured and how collaboration was performed in that space. The third visualization is the Idea Network, which connects idea dynamics with the social structure of the people who generated them, displaying how social influence among neighbors may have affected collaborative activities and where innovative ideas arose and spread in the social network.},

  abstract={The role of data governance is experiencing a paradigm shift as organizations increasingly incorporate data governance to encourage the strategic utilization of data and, therefore, promote data-driven innovation. However, the opportunities arising from technological advancements and novel value propositions based on data come with implications that often stem from external and internal contingent factors, e.g., industry characteristics or organizational structures. In combination with inadequate practices regarding the conduct of data, difficulties in the adoption of data governance can increase. This article draws upon established practices from information technology governance and organizational theory, specifically contingency theory, to examine occurring antecedents in the adoption of data governance at Thales Ground Transportation Systems, a manufacturer of solutions for the railway infrastructure. By investigating the nomological link between antecedents, adoption, and consequences, associated implications for data governance can be taken into account in early phases of adoption to promote data-driven innovation. The article proposes new antecedents evolving from interorganizational dynamics such as data collaborations in the respective ecosystem.},

  abstract={The article is devoted to the interaction of imperatives and technologies of the "fast" and "slow" worlds in relation to the task of managing strategic communications of cities and regions.Fast worlds create technological platforms for self-organization of distributed cognitive and emotional experience gained by digital stakeholders during interaction with a territory. On the other hand, strategic meaning-making for the formation or revitalization of a place brand continues to be the prerogative of the "slow world". The vectors of "long history", traditional culture, architecture, landscapes, etc. work here. The article discusses the communication trends of territories arising in the zones of interference of fast and slow flows of place marketing.In the article the authors present their vision of the current state of the theory of place branding and image-making, based on the analysis of the works of foreign and Russian researchers (S. Anholt, D. Vizgalov, D. Houghton, A. Stevens, M. Kavaratzis, S. Van Gelder, etc.).The article considers the dialectics of the so-called "fast" and "slow worlds" technologies in the sphere of place branding and shows the main directions of theoretical understanding of the changes taking place in this sphere.An approach to the understanding of territorial stakeholders of both fast and slow worlds is substantiated. In this role are active groups of people who have the potential to be included in the communication on the construction of the place brand. And also an attempt is made to differentiate communications with different groups of audiences in the contemporary context and taking into account current trends.},

The use of these standards and guidelines for project management increases the knowledge of managers and helps the organization to achieve better results. These are associated with several areas of knowledge or competencies, each with their own processes to develop. From the study of these standards a comparative / prospective model was developed. For the development of this model, 12 standards were studied. This work seeks to understand each of them, as well as the areas associated, and finally characterize the changes that have occurred between editions. This model intends to show the evolution in project management as well as its possible future. The objective would be the classification and structuring of the area and the concepts. Therefore, it is intended with this paper to contribute with a well-founded perception of the future development of project management, anticipating links between important themes for the development of this discipline.},

  abstract={As robots play an increasingly important role in people’s lives, researchers are working on robotic vehicles with powerful intelligence. However, a problem that cannot be ignored is resource constraints on the edge. Considering the gaming issues of resource constraints and intelligence level, we focus on robots with limited computing resources and propose an idea of changing from lightweight to powerful intelligence for a smart robotic system. Firstly, we design a series of ultra-lightweight algorithms according to the lightweight resource Limitation. Second, we collaborate the ultra-lightweight algorithms through a centralized-distributed architecture to achieve intelligent upgrading of the whole system. Then, by maximizing the use of resources and information, we accomplish a heterogeneous ultra-lightweight multi-robotic collaborative system. Finally, the presented architecture has been applied to realize a lightweight simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Experimentally, the ultra-lightweight algorithm achieves 900 fps on the server experimental platform. Since there have been less heterogeneous collaborative methods, we further compared it with the state-of-the-art homogeneous collaborative system and proved that the accuracy of our proposed system was improved by 45.98%.},

  abstract={The increase in ease of the production of computer simulated graphics has opened new opportunities in the 3D industry. There are unlimited applications for the delivery of 3D Graphics especially concerning 3D multimedia presentation of digital content. Apart from aesthetic and entertaining reasons, experts apply computer simulations to visualize environments and to identify early errors or costs in order to limit the need of making real prototypes. Thus, 3D Graphics also minimize the time required for developing the final product. Existing 3D applications give partial support to users to engage in collaborative contribution for the production of a 3D model. However, when 3D artists are required to collaboratively produce a high quality 3D model based on thousands of polygons, they have to integrate the different parts of the model when the modelling process has been completed, which is a slow tedious process. This paper investigates how to dynamically and simultaneously apply changes to the same 3D model based on a collaborative network exploiting a Grid infrastructure.},

This work proposes a methodology to tackle ICPS synthesis in a systematic way, by using a set of industrial agents that take as input and standardized process description file and automatically deploy a modular ICPS from predesigned functional containers. Concrete examples on a tanks system and an industrial paste thickener are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract={In this article, a miniaturized fractal localized electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure for signal and power integrities is intelligently modeled and optimized with a K-means generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed EBG structure is realized with a combination of L-shaped bridge and slit patch, which is inserted by a Koch fractal resonator with a smaller electric length. To minimize the influence of the period EBG structure on the signal integrity, the fractal structure is only designed on the noise source and sensitive area with localized topology. In comparison with the traditional GRNN method, the modeling precision for discontinuous points such as resonance and antiresonance peaks of the scattering parameter curve can be improved with K-means-GRNN. Finally, a power distribution network sample with the proposed localized fractal EBG structure is designed with a steep suppression level of −50 dB from 0.36 to 20 GHz.},

  abstract={Agile approaches to software development offer flexibility and autonomy to developers, while demanding discipline and attentiveness. At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger’s Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm’s history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.},

  abstract={Numerical simulation has become omnipresent in the automotive domain, posing new challenges such as high-dimensional parameter spaces and large as well as incomplete and multi-faceted data. In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration. We evaluated the new approach in the automotive industry, studying noise simulation data for an internal combustion engine.},

  abstract={In Turkey, refugees from Syria have been continuously increasing with rapid urbanization. Concurrently, energy consumption has been growing promptly. Supply and demand equality may be a crucial problem in the electricity market causing further instability and shortages leading to reliable predictions a necessity. For this reason, an informative questionnaire is prepared to take the expert opinions on the main drivers that shape the energy consumption behavior of Syrian refugees. In total, 17 experts are interviewed. The answers are explored by using NETICA software for Bayesian Belief Networks. Factors affecting energy consumption behavior and also strategies, institutions, tools, and financing methods that change the behavior toward efficient consumption are investigated. Based on obtained results, it can be claimed that to be successful, electricity prices and tariffs in the market should be arranged in the favor of energy efficiency. Besides, support mechanisms by not only the government but also by the municipalities should be considered while setting related policies. Also, electric appliance producers should develop and implement strategies and actions to encourage the usage of more efficient appliances. Last but not the least, nongovernmental organizations should raise refugees’ awareness of the efficient electricity consumption to minimize the impacts of refugee inflows on the electricity market.},

So, the integration and comparison of diverse GORE (Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering) methods are difficult. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that SEMAT can be used for achieving a better understanding of the GORE methods. Consequently, the relationships among these methods are easier to treat.

  abstract={During the last few years, increasing emphasis has been given to geo-education in middle and high school curricula, transforming the way certain subjects are now taught to provide students with comprehensive knowledge about dynamics and interconnections in the world, which also rely on relevant geographic information. This is the case for history, geography, the earth sciences, and other subjects. However, so far, little has been done to provide adequate learning tools that can support such an important transformation. This paper proposes the integration of advanced geospatial technology in traditional interactive learning tools as a way to describe experiences that help students understand phenomena and improve their competencies. The system is the result of a usability engineering process aimed at providing users with an effective learning experience, iteratively analysing their expectations and needs with respect to geo-referenced content. The resulting learning environment, Maps4Learning, allows users to manage content in terms of learning objects named geoLO+, which are extended with spatial and temporal components and built according to standardized metadata. The system was tested in the context of a middle school programme. A usability study was carried out to analyse the impact of geoLO+ resources in terms of perceived quality, engagement, and student learning performance, and the outcomes of the resources were compared to the outcomes of traditional teaching methods. The results were encouraging and showed that learning improvement can indeed be achieved using Maps4Learning.},

  abstract={In the recent decades, accessibility received increasing attention. As a result, nowadays, established principles (e.g., Universal Design) contribute to creating products that take into consideration the diverse needs and abilities of all individuals. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the digital and physical world: while websites and user interfaces are adopting accessibility principles, most devices do not support an equitable use. Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it can be integrated in current technology without requiring any modification. We detail the architecture of the system and we discuss its advantages and use cases.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In an aging population, the prevalence of people with dementia is increasing. Intelligent environments can offer a solution to support people in the early stages of dementia, who often experience problems with maintaining their day-night rhythm. The focus of this work is developing an Intelligent Environment for assisting these people with their daily structure while living independently at home. Three co-creation methods with several stakeholder groups were used to elicit requirements and develop a prototype of an Intelligent Environment. Participants were involved in sessions using Mind Maps (N=55), Idea Generation Cards (N=35), and in a multidisciplinary design team with representatives of eight organizations. The result of these sessions was a set of 10 requirements for the Intelligent Environment on the following topics: context-awareness, pattern recognition, adaptation, support, personalization, autonomy, modularity, dementia proof interaction, costs, data and privacy. Based on these requirements, several scenarios were developed to explicate such an environment for supporting people with early dementia. The design team translated the requirements to a real-life prototype of an Intelligent Environment integrated into a demonstration home. The prototype serves as a basis for further development of Intelligent Environments to enable people with dementia to live longer independently at home.},

  abstract={Emerging technology has been used in many sectors as avenues to ease the way of living. Emerging technology applications can help people to deal with daily life challenges, especially in healthcare aspects. A high-quality healthcare can be provided to patients and the community through various healthy lifestyle programmes. Good healthcare practices in daily living are essential for an improve quality of life and wellbeing. This review focused on understanding the purposes of existing emerging technologies that were used in healthcare and healthy lifestyle. This review was conducted using a systematic search and processes through selected digital databases. Based on the existing frameworks that used emerging technologies in the healthcare sector, we found that the factors that contributed to the technology use depended on the acceptance and adaptation of the users. Thus, it is important to raise awareness and create a proper framework on the emerging technology especially for the use of middle aged people before they reach their old age.},

  abstract={Cyber resilience moves organizations away from efforts to guarantee security of all systems, towards an approach that acknowledges that systems are bound to fail with a focus instead on the impact of that failure on business objectives. While the work on cyber resilience is evolving, there is a lack of studies using qualitative data for investigating the concepts and themes pertaining to cyber resilience in organizations. The purpose of this study is to uncover the non-technical organizational factors that contribute to better cyber resilience. By adopting a qualitative approach of analyzing factors of organizational resilience, this paper uses primary data collected through 25 interviews at senior leadership or board-level to point out the extent to which these factors facilitate or impede cyber resilience. The study illustrates a Leximancer map of each factor that characterizes organizational cyber resilience, based on insights from cyber practitioner communities through narrative interviews. This research contributes to a better theoretical and practical understanding of how cyber resilience within organizations can be improved. The findings show that cyber strategy and skilled people playa key role in adoption of cyber culture at the management level, while communication between boards and security leadership as well as a clear reporting structure are signals for building cyber resilience.},

  abstract={In recent years, market researchers have increasingly adopted automation, among other things to understand what users want from their product or service and how satisfied they are overall or with specific features or changes. Crowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE) is concerned with similar questions and employs requirements engineering (RE) methods to answer them. This suggests that the boundary between the fields of market research and CrowdRE has become blurred. This in turn raises the question: When is something still CrowdRE, and when has it become market research? This is an important question because it may require the community to rethink how industry might perceive CrowdRE in a wider context, and how future research should be framed. This problem statement paper explores this question along several real-world scenarios to trigger discussions in the community regarding possible solutions.},

  abstract={VR technology has highlighted a huge role in ideological and political teaching in colleges and universities. The architecture of VR is used to define the component model and interactive topology of the Internet of Things application system, which is the basis of constructing ideological and political teaching system supporting horizontal interconnection, heterogeneous integration, resource sharing and dynamic maintenance. At present, service-oriented software architecture is the most commonly used style to construct ideological and political application system. VR technology is oriented to the reference model of Internet of Things software architecture centered on “object end” in ideological and political teaching in colleges and universities. This paper compares and analyzes the reference models of ideological and political teaching, points out the differences in the types of teaching software components based on them, the principles of teaching design adopted and the structural attributes, and shows that these reference models are suitable for guiding the construction of Internet of Things application systems with different scales and different application requirements. The formal modeling and model detection methods of ideological and political teaching application system based on software architecture are analyzed. Finally, VR technology points out the specific work that needs to be carried out in the future to establish the application system development method of ideological and political teaching in colleges and universities based on software architecture.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic brought into focus the crucial role of computational modeling and simulation in informing and/or advising governments and societies, demonstrating the profound influence that modelers can have, particularly in times of crisis. This global experience has (re)shaped political and public demands on science and technology and the ways in which we incorporate scientific findings in our everyday lives. Through a brief review of models developed for COVID-19, this paper discusses the urgent need to move towards ‘responsible modeling’ in which social, ethical, and cultural issues claim the same importance as technical aspects. This includes a new social contract between modeler and society on one hand, and science and policy on the other hand. The characteristics of modeling work under this new paradigm, however, are still not well understood and are a topic of debate. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new research agenda that can facilitate the discussion about ‘responsible modeling’ and the overarching principles that underpin the concept’s aims and objectives.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper details the creation and implementation of a macroethics lesson into a required sophomore-level aerospace engineering course at a large research university. The primary, novel learning objective for this macroethics lesson is for students to analyze how their own ethical philosophy and personal values influence their perspective on an ethical issue in aerospace engineering. This paper begins with a review of the literature used to guide the development of this macroethics lesson. Next, the outline and content of the lesson is presented which consisted of two distinct activities. The first was an introductory presentation on ethics and identifying personal values. This was followed by students choosing an “issue brief” (written by the authors of this paper) on a current macroethical issue in aerospace engineering. The brief topics were the military-industrial complex, space sustainability and orbital debris, and space settlement and resource utilization. After reading their selected brief, students engaged in a structured discussion on the issue in which they identified and ranked stakeholders, and reflected on how their own values were reflected in their ranking of stakeholders. This paper concludes with a discussion of the impact and effectiveness of the lesson with reflections from the authors, and presents quantitative and qualitative survey data from the sophomore students who completed the macroethics lesson.},

  abstract={A well-balanced project design using appropriate process models is an important success factor for the management of engineering development projects. There exists a wide range of different process models, including traditional waterfall-based models as well as agile development models like Scrum. Such standardized process models offer a good starting point for the management of engineering development projects; however, they have to be tailored in order to meet the needs of a specific project. Additionally, in complex environments, it might be necessary to construct dedicated process models, like hybrid combinations of several models. In this article, the groundwork for a systematic approach to the construction and tailoring of process models for engineering development projects is presented. It considers relevant international standards as well as traditional and agile process models and can serve as a basis for the subsequent tailoring processes. The developed framework offers the possibility to add distinctive characteristics to a process model, like means which facilitate quality, communication, or knowledge transfer. The evaluation of the framework was done by means of a case study, a survey, and expert interviews.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The following Research-to-Practice full paper presents the outcomes of a remote synchronous flipped classroom implementation of a senior-level data management course. As flipped classroom models of instruction have gained popularity in higher education, it has prompted the need for an investigation into content-specific methods for flipped curriculum design. Our work identified and implemented flipped classroom design factors in an Advanced Database Design (CIT 44400) course to address a gap in research around flipped classroom models within undergraduate data-science courses. Through literature review, we identified a set of eight factors of effective flipped classroom instruction and evaluated them via survey, focus group, course evaluation, student performance, and interview data. We segmented designed course activities which incorporated these eight factors with a set of learning objectives that emphasized collaborative iterative practices to position students as designers and evaluators of solutions to industry-authentic problems. Instructional design factors were evaluated via course evaluations and student surveys followed by an activity-based qualitative analysis of focus group, instructor interview, and student free-response data to understand student perceptions of instructional approaches, intended versus practical outcomes of such activities, and guidelines for future course design iterations and research. We argue instructional design must be student-centered and consider student goals alongside those that are ‘scripted’ into the course structure to best serve, motivate, and engage students. During the Fall 2020 implementation of CIT 44400, we prioritized learner independence, peer collaboration, and critical thinking in the instructional design, selecting flipped methodologies with the intention of fostering these skills in senior students. In light of Covid-19, the course was adapted to be synchronous online. Regardless of these unforeseen constraints, student performance and course evaluation data indicate that with peer and instructor feedback, students were able to apply course content appropriately in their final independent project as evidenced by a 12% increase in assessment scores and an improvement in students average overall final course grades from a ‘B’ to an ‘A-’ as compared to the previously taught Fall 2019 lecture-based section of the same class. Course evaluation scores also improved from 3.22 to 3.66 from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. Self-reported survey data from students indicate that (a) feedback from the instructor, (b) small group work, (c) revision of work based on feedback, and (d) solution evaluations were the most positively impactful instructional design elements throughout the course. In particular, students mentioned one-on-one scaffolding from the instructor as beneficial for their learning. Students also communicated challenges faced during the pandemic, complaints, and recommendations for future course iterations. Data from focus group discussions conveyed that students (a) generally had positive learning experiences despite the constraints of learning exclusively online and (b) developed the industry-specific collaborative practices which were designed into the forefront of our instructional model. The flipped classroom design and implementation process in this research is transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to design a domain-specific flipped model for their classroom which considers the needs of one's students, the challenges of the current time, and the state of the field at large.},

  abstract={This paper concerns the personalization of intelligent buildings, where intelligence of a building is considered in a broad sense, not confined to the computational aspects. Personalization is desired in order to give the individual greater representation in the building and for energy consumption/well-being balance in the context of measuring building intelligent quotient. The paper examines problems of programming in pervasive space, and current systems for personalization. It discusses design issues relating to human representation in the building, active and passive human participation, the nature of the personal agent, ownership and location, transparency, and norm-based agency. A design based upon active involvement of the occupant is presented},

  abstract={Due to ever stricter noise regulations and increasing passenger comfort requirements, noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) simulation remains very important in the automotive industry. Noise simulation data analysis is challenging due to the data size and complexity. The Campbell diagram is a standard tool for noise analysis that summarizes noise for all frequencies and all operational points. We propose an interactive approach to a detailed analysis of the noise simulation data by means of interactive visualization. This approach, as an addition to the conventional analysis, provides additional insight into the data and facilitates the understanding of the simulated phenomenon. We deploy a coordinated multiple views configuration consisting of a parallel coordinates view, a 3D view, and three multi-view projections. The approach is illustrated using NVH simulation data for a four cylinder internal combustion engine.},

  abstract={This paper discusses a computational architecture called the Analytic Component System (ACS), which aims to provide intelligence analysts with a service-oriented computational platform. This platform is designed to empower intelligence analysts by improving the integration of people, algorithms, software, tools, and manual work in the production of time-pressured intelligence assessments. Combining the perspectives of the ACS computer science design team and an embedded social scientist, this paper will use ACS to discuss the “platformization” of intelligence analysis and what this means for how we might think about and plan for reflexive design in future computational intelligence analytic systems.},

  abstract={Requirements specification in requirements engineering phase of SDLC has a great influence on the overall development of a software project. There is a huge amount of knowledge created and communicated during the entire process that needs to be managed in a structured manner incorporating both explicit and tacit knowledge. There is a lot of difficulty in documenting the tacit knowledge and consequently misunderstood or ambiguous stakeholder needs have aroused the researchers to devise techniques and models to minimize these difficulties. Due to the complexity of new arising systems, it has become difficult to understand the needs of stakeholders properly even with using the traditional models. Therefore, there is still not a widely accepted solution to all the problems faced in managing requirements. This paper presents a review and a state-of-the-art of previous approaches to managing knowledge in requirements engineering and also proposes a need for a better generic model.},

  pages={379-384},
  abstract={A cardinal responsibility of a software engineer is to analyze a given problem and through semantic mapping, apply apropos techniques and constructs to develop viable software solutions. The dominant curriculum models for software engineers has focused on the solution space's declarative knowledge and has mostly relegated problem solving skills to that of a consequence of the primary educational process. In this paper we present a constructivist aware strategy to amend software engineering curricula by integrating problem solving skill development. To build this approach we examined mathematician Gyorgy Polya's heuristic of a generalized problem solving model in the context of software engineering (SE) and propose the necessary augmentation to support skill development. We take the position that Polya's approach may not only functionally address well defined problems encountered at an introductory level but is expandable to tackle ill-structured or wicked problems inherent in the design of complex systems. We present a controlled classroom study which investigates the utility of the proposed methodology to address a set of welldefined problems in a small representative student sampling. Our results show a significant reduction in time to solution given classroom support.},

  title={Bring the human to the network: 5G and beyond}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Communication networks beyond 5G will bring about a human existence that is ever more virtual. Allowing new communication services with virtual existence and involvement everywhere is likely to redefine and place new demands on how humans can and wish (or do not wish) to engage with the connected network. The ubiquitous nature of the 6G network evolution enables increased involvement and affords more power to networks and machines (and those designing them) versus humans. This paper advocates that human-centric 6G networks should put humans' interests and potential first and foremost, in a holistic manner. There is a need to critically monitor, (r)evaluate, and adjust the above power implications. Human-centric design perspectives applied to future network technologies incorporate the human element more broadly. Thus, meaningful user control, empowerment, and agency should be key features of future network technologies beyond 5G and 6G. The network system's ability to protect human potential and humanity first, to serve multiple normative standards, while balancing the interests of all parties, can become a catalyst for stimulating better governing practices and for managing consensus building between individuals, communities, governments, and networked machines embedded with human-like capabilities. However, realising this vision and potential requires a thorough alignment with the human- and humanity-centric paradigm and a renewal of its operationalisation and implementation. This paper overviews a set of human-centric design interpretations and discusses the next challenges and implications in a beyond 5G and 6G context.},

  abstract={Affective or kansei design engineering is a design approach that can help designers to produce emotionally pleasing products. One of the research challenge of this approach lies in understanding customers' affective needs and how to associate such needs with product design features. Previously, we have proposed a collaborative tagging methodology towards understanding associations between affective needs and product design features through analyzing product reviews. In this paper, we proposed a framework for collaborative tagging system design as an extension of our previous work and actual web-based implementation of our approach. We showcase the design of our web-based system which includes client interface layer, web application layer and back-end application processing layer with detailed elaboration on essential system components and modules. Some potential benefits of implementing such a collaborative platform are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract={Meetings are a frequent part of life for a software developer. Software design is often performed, discussed, and reviewed in these meetings. This means that meetings may contain important design information that could be captured for later use. Meeting design tools may be a way to capture design information as a byproduct of discussion that arises in these meetings. In this paper, we identify a list of key meeting support tool features that could support the capture and retrieval of design information and compare these to features currently offered in commercial meeting support tools.},

  pages={982-986},
  abstract={In the recent decades, accessibility received increasing attention. As a result, nowadays, established principles (e.g., Universal Design) contribute to creating products that take into consideration the diverse needs and abilities of all individuals. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the digital and physical world: while websites and user interfaces are adopting accessibility principles, most devices do not support an equitable use. Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it can be integrated in current technology without requiring any modification. We detail the architecture of the system and we discuss its advantages and use cases.},

  pages={228-234},
  abstract={At present, the work of spacecraft flight control is in the downstream stage of the whole mission chain, and the flight control work mode cannot adapt to the subsequent space missions. In response to these limitations, a conceptual design of a work mode for space flight control from the metaverse’ s perspective is proposed. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is adopted as the basic methodology for constructing the flight control metaverse. A common flight control infrastructure is proposed as the foundation for mission system development. A flight control metaverse architecture that targets missions throughout the flight control process is built with extensive applications of AI technology. A new flight control work mode and a mission system work mode are designed to bring about systemic innovation in the flight control work mode. The former work mode features a model-based design of flight control schemes, agile and automatic implementation of mission systems, integrated flight control mission implementation, and parallel operation in physical and virtual spaces. The latter work mode comes with intelligent control, flexible deployment, and autonomous operation capabilities. The flight control metaverse presents a new mode of working space for flight control. The new flight control work mode that builds on the flight control metaverse can be used as a technical reference for the continuous innovation and improvement of subsequent flight control practices.},
