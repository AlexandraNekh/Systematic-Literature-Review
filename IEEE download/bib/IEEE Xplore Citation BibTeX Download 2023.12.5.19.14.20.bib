  abstract={In contemporary agriculture, protecting ripening fruit crops is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity and preventing economic losses. This study presents an intelligent, Edge Computing-based acoustic bird repellent system developed to deter birds from damaging ripening fruits in orchards. The system is equipped with microphone sensors to detect bird vocalizations and audible alarms utilized to scare off the birds. Machine learning algorithms analyze the collected audio data to identify bird sounds in real-time and generate effective bird repellent noises accordingly. This Edge Computing solution minimizes data transmission latency and network load, providing rapid and efficient protection. The system can be tailored to different bird species and optimized according to specific conditions within the orchard. Experimental tests conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed acoustic bird repellent system is successful in safeguarding fruit crops and significantly mitigating the detrimental impact of birds. In conclusion, the Edge Computingbased acoustic bird repellent system offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution in the agricultural domain, assisting in the prevention of yield loss in orchards and enhancing economic benefits.},

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in the medical field has demonstrated encouraging potential for enhancing the quality of life of patients who suffer from physical impairments. This comprises the creation of an artificial intelligence agent that is trained in a virtual reality game using a deep reinforcement learning (DQN) algorithm. This will be used as a form of game therapy for children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. The virtual reality game's artificial intelligence can give the child individualized feedback based on their specific skills and how far they've come in the game. As it observes visible growth over time, this can help the child build confidence and self-esteem, which is a win-win situation. This to the enhancement of the child's confidence as well as their general well-being. Multiple studies have shown that artificial intelligence-assisted game therapy is beneficial in enhancing the ability of thinking and overall quality of life of children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. Children who took part in a virtual reality (VR) game treatment programmed using an artificial intelligence (AI) avatar exhibited significant gains in mental ability to think and their confidence level when compared to others. The usage of a virtual reality (VR) game that incorporates an AI agent that has been trained using the DQN algorithm as a form of game therapy for children who suffer from paraplegia has the potential to significantly improve the children's overall quality of life. Researchers should anticipate seeing even more creative uses of virtual reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical and rehabilitation fields as the technology continues to advance.},

Then a bargain protocol for E-Commerce oriented automated negotiation is presented, that can be seen as an extension of FIPA interaction specifications. This protocol, with formal and intuitive semantics, can be used in automated negotiation among agents coming from different organizations if they follow the specification.},

  abstract={While deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a large number of complex tasks, it remains a big challenge to deploy such networks for practical, on-device edge scenarios such as on mobile devices, consumer devices, drones, and vehicles. There has been significant recent effort in designing small, low-footprint deep neural networks catered for low-power edge devices, with much of the focus on two extremes: hand-crafting via design principles or fully automated network architecture search. In this study, we take a deeper exploration into a human-machine collaborative design approach for creating highly efficient deep neural networks through a synergy between principled network design prototyping and machine-driven design exploration. The efficacy of human-machine collaborative design is demonstrated through the creation of AttoNets, a family of highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device edge deep learning. Each AttoNet possesses a human-specified network-level macro-architecture comprising of custom modules with unique machine-designed module-level macro-architecture and micro-architecture designs, all driven by human-specified design requirements. Experimental results for the task of object recognition showed that the AttoNets created via human-machine collaborative design has significantly fewer parameters and computational costs than state-of-the-art networks designed for efficiency while achieving noticeably higher accuracy (with the smallest AttoNet achieving ~1.8% higher accuracy while requiring ~10x fewer multiply-add operations and parameters than MobileNet-V1). Furthermore, the efficacy of the AttoNets is demonstrated for the task of instance segmentation and object detection, where an AttoNet-based Mask R-CNN network was constructed with significantly fewer parameters and computational costs (~5x fewer multiply-add operations and ~2x fewer parameters) than a ResNet-50 based Mask R-CNN network.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) for K-12 education has been considered a global initiative. However, evidence of Africa’s inclusion in globalization across schools is lacking in the literature. Besides, resources, including materials and content, are developed across Hong Kong, Japan, Europe, and the USA. These suggest that contextualized resources are effective for AI implementation in schools. Since appropriate pedagogical approaches, sound instructional methods, materials, tools, and activities familiar to the student for instruction lead to effective learning, we embark on a literature survey to unravel the approaches and kind of AI resources utilized across contexts. A systematic literature review methodology was used in this paper to understand the trends of teaching AI at the K-12 educational level. Scientific databases such as IEEE, ACM, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to gather relevant literature in tandem with our research aim. Out of the 451 articles that were retrieved, only 54 fit well into the inclusion criteria and were reviewed for further analysis. This study revealed several existing approaches and resources used to teach AI in schools.},

  abstract={Several policy options exist, or have been proposed, to further responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment. Institutions, including U.S. government agencies, states, professional societies, and private and public sector businesses, are well positioned to implement these policies. However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI technologies or incidents. We recognize that no one policy will lead to responsible AI and instead advocate for strategic policy implementation across institutions.},

  abstract={Individuals who demonstrate well-founded fears of persecution or face real risk of being subjected to torture, are eligible for asylum under Danish law. Decision outcomes, however, are often influenced by the subjective perceptions of the asylum applicant’s credibility. Literature reports on correlations between asylum outcomes and various extra-legal factors. Artificial Intelligence has often been used to uncover such correlations and highlight the predictability of the asylum outcomes. In this work, we employ a dataset of asylum decisions in Denmark to study the variations in recognition rates, on the basis of several application features, such as the applicant’s nationality, identified gender, religion etc. We use Machine Learning classifiers to assess the predictability of the cases’ outcomes on the basis of such features. We find that depending on the classifier, and the considered features, different predictability outcomes arise. We highlight, therefore, the need to take such discrepancies into account, before drawing conclusions with regards to the causes of the outcomes’ predictability.},

  abstract={Building trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, whether in academia or industry, must take into consideration a number of dimensions including legal, social, ethical, public opinion, and environmental aspects. A plethora of guidelines, principles, and toolkits have been published globally, but have seen limited grassroots implementation, especially among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills, and resources. In this article, we report on qualitative SME consultations over two events to establish their understanding of both data and AI ethical principles and to identify the key barriers SMEs face in their adoption of ethical AI approaches. We then use independent experts to review and code 77 published toolkits designed to build and support ethical and responsible AI practices, based on 33 evaluation criteria. The toolkits were evaluated considering their scope to address the identified SME barriers to adoption, human-centric AI principles, AI life cycle stages, and key themes around responsible AI and practical usability. Toolkits were ranked on the basis of criteria coverage and expert intercoder agreement. Results show that there is not a one-size-fits-all toolkit that addresses all criteria suitable for SMEs. Our findings show few exemplars of practical application, little guidance on how to use/apply the toolkits, and very low uptake by SMEs. Our analysis provides a mechanism for SMEs to select their own toolkits based on their current capacity, resources, and ethical awareness levels – focusing initially at the conceptualization stage of the AI life cycle and then extending throughout.},

Then from the point of view based on semantics and QoS (Quality of Service), the main framework of resource matchmaking is constructed, in which three processes are included: task modeling, resource modeling, semantic modeling and resource matchmaking. On the basis of resource representation model and manufacturing featuresoriented task representation model, combining with the research results of semantic web, some pivotal concepts are defined about the matchmaking resources. Finally, by means of a functional semantic extending method based on the ontology and QoS, the MR matchmaking algorithm is constructed.},

  abstract={Private freight transportation has many advantages, including speed, comfort and affordability. However, it is not often efficient to shorten longer commute times, as it is unable to keep-up with logistics demand during peak hours. Integrative policies, in flow terms, could fill this gap when supported through freight consolidation. Yet, a key issue that emerges in the implementation of consolidation-based transportation systems is that of logistics demand for reducing uncertainties about whether it will be met. The main target of this article is to include demand volatility to carry out a longterm urban land splitting that serve in building consolidation network. To that end, we propose a hybrid machine-learning framework combining several algorithms that are thought robust according to the literature and the achieved accuracy benchmarks. Based upon simulated system, some analytical outlooks are provided below.},

  abstract={In response to the needs of various stakeholders, the FAA has developed an automated tool that provides values for expected next day airport runway configurations and their respective arrival and departure rates. The arrival and departure rates at an airport define the capacity of an airport and as such are a critical piece in determining whether not a capacity/demand imbalance is expected. A forecast of these imbalances facilitates next-day planning and provides to stakeholders transparency regarding potential traffic constraints. The use case that motivated the work described in this paper is to develop various machine-learning (ML) models and compare their performance against the current automated tool, which finds operational periods with similar facility (airport) weather and uses the most frequently occurring runway configuration and rates as the capacity forecast for the next day. Extensive model development across five airports and four years of operational data and forecasted weather showed that the ML models consistently had higher accuracy than the automated tool. Among the ML models, superior options were found, but a single best model across all airports and predictions was not. In a follow-on effort, the authors hope to explore opportunities for working with the user community, incorporate their feedback, and determine if one or more ML models can be used in practice.},

Through participatory design sessions with over 15 researchers and engineers at Facebook, we have developed, deployed, and iteratively improved ActiVis, an interactive visualization system for interpreting large-scale deep learning models and results. By tightly integrating multiple coordinated views, such as a computation graph overview of the model architecture, and a neuron activation view for pattern discovery and comparison, users can explore complex deep neural network models at both the instance-and subset-level.

  abstract={Virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI) application in healthcare has shown promise in improving the lives of those with physical limitations. This article describes how an AI agent was created and then taught using the deep reinforcement learning Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) algorithm in a virtual reality game for paraplegic children. Depending on the child's individual skills and development, the AI agent in the Virtual Reality(VR) game may provide them with feedback that is specifically suited. If the child observes actual growth over time, this might help to foster confidence and self-esteem. The AI agent may also provide real-time feedback that is responsive to the child's movements, which will help to improve the child's physical function and all-around wellbeing. Many Research have shown how AI-assisted game therapy can improve the motor skills and general wellbeing of paraplegic youngsters. In one such study, children who participated in a Virtual Reality (VR) gaming therapy created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent showed remarkably greater improvements in balance and gait than those who received conventional physical therapy. In order to improve the quality of life for children with paraplegia, this research aims to use an AI agent that has been trained using the Deep Q-Learning Network(DQN) algorithm in a Virtual Reality (VR) game, that should be anticipate seeing much more varied applications of AI and VR in healthcare and treatment as technology advances.},

  abstract={The value proposition canvas introduced in 2015 by Pigneur et al. is broadly used by entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs to create new services and products. We decided to apply it for collaborative and blended design thinking activities in a specialization in human-Computer interaction for master students in computer and data sciences. While being very useful, the original value proposition canvas relies on a business-oriented vocabulary not familiar to science and engineering students. Moreover, its underlying profit-oriented objective makes it difficult to focus on impact and trust-oriented design activities. In this paper, we propose two alternative value proposition canvases, one dedicated to sustainability for development and one to explainability for artificial intelligence. The motivations why and the ways how these alternative canvases were elicited and used in higher education are also discussed.},

  abstract={Complex product development becomes more and more knowledge-intensive. Knowledge integration faces the problems of semantic ambiguity and semantic heterogeneity due to cross-functional teams and multiple cross-domain applications involved in collaborative design environment. To address these problems, this paper presents a mechanism for integrated product modeling with semantic enhancing through ontology technology. Core ontology is constructed to provide a shared semantic foundation. By mapping core ontology according application contexts, application ontologies are built to explicit the application specific semantics. Based on these, core product model containing kernel information of a product and domain models are constructed. To support semantic interoperability, a multi-strategies based semantic reconcile method through core ontology is proposed to discover semantic correspondences between domain ontologies.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Aviation is a conservative field with a focus on deterministic systems that continuously builds on known risks. Currently, available aviation design assurance methods using safety assurance standards are not suited for regulatory assurance of autonomous systems Aviation is facing enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) technology. The challenge for applicants and regulators is to assure system safety of autonomous systems. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions. This paper explores whether the aviation industry can apply those solutions to UAS and UAM assurance. ANSI/UL 4600, Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products, is the first and only publicly available autonomous safety standard. This standard is backed by a certified non-profit standards organization, Underwriters Laboratories. This standard has been recognized as an international American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved standard. The goal-based, technology neutral features of ANSI/UL 4600 make it adaptable to other industries and applications. It assures safety through monitoring safety performance, which enables the desired aviation regulatory approach. It reflects stakeholder views from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who have contemplated the product liability for the design and manufacturing challenges associated with these new technologies. The applicability to the aviation industry can be understood in terms of these features: Goal-Based and Technology Neutral: ANSI/UL 4600 does not require a specific design approach or specific technology. The applicant company must present an auditable and defensible evidence-based safety case. Those central features of safety and auditability follow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance philosophy and could be adapted to aviation. Continued Airworthiness with Monitored Safety Metrics: The FAA's desire to move to performance-based standards with risk-based strategy is supported by ANSI/UL 4600. Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology. Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability. Applicants could design and test appropriate to their technology while regulators can audit and check for safety case completeness. Over time, industry can standardize some portions of testing as the technology matures. Different standards and codified standard approaches could also be independently designed and adapted as technology becomes standardized across the industry. Aviation regulators are already on this path to make performance-based regulations where applicants have the choice of technology and standards that can support innovation. Industry and Public Stakeholder Engagement: The standard has undergone industry and public scrutiny in the automobile segment with considered reviews from technical, legal, and actuarial perspectives. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) have been working to implement a safety case umbrella that encompasses all facets of UAS and UAM development, operation, and maintenance. The safety case umbrella is a systems approach to combine specific UAS and UAM nuances as they relate to current regulatory structure. While the approach affords a performance-based and risk-based oversight of aircraft design and development, production, maintenance and operation, the current regulations were not written to address AI and specifically machine learning. Even when those advanced techniques are not used, small UASs often use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and technology of unknown pedigree could also be assured by the regulators using that approach. The codified approach of ANSI/UL 4600 could be superimposed on the safety case umbrella approach based on current regulations. The exercise of creating an auditable safety case also increases applicant safety awareness and safety culture. For approval of UAS and UAM, this paper recommends a structured and practical framework with an evidence-based safety case, which also takes into consideration the current regulations for applicability to UAS and UAM safety.},

First, we aim at providing an objective analysis of requirements that need to be fulfilled by metaverse platforms. We survey a broad set of criteria including interoperability, immersiveness, persistence, multimodal and social interaction, scalability, level of openness, configurability, market access, security, and blockchain integration, among others. Second, we review a wide range of existing metaverse platforms, and we critically evaluate their ability to meet the requirements listed. We identify their limitations, which must be addressed to establish fair, trustworthy, and interactive experiences within the metaverse ecosystem. Looking forward, we highlight the need for further research and development in areas such as decentralization, improved security and privacy measures, and the integration of emerging technologies like blockchain and AI, as essential building blocks for a resilient and secure metaverse.},

  abstract={In the past century many medical advancements in prosthetics have been achieved, however, discomfort in prosthetic socket remains one of the toughest challenges faced by both amputees and prosthetists. Wearing an uncomfortable socket can lead to users discontinuing use of their socket and subsequently reducing their long-term mobility; negatively impact their psychological health; and prolong rehabilitation. This paper continues the research conducted in earlier publications [1], [2], which introduced the concept of an automated ISO standard robotic testing rig to test a full artificial limb prosthesis (a bio-inspired transfemoral prosthetic socket attached to robotic prosthetic joints and an ankle joint). This paper presents an automated method of designing the bio-inspired socket using artificial intelligence to reduce discomfort and the design time of new or existing full artificial lower limbs using qualitative and quantitative data. The socket will be tested in a gait simulation shown in the figure 7, to safely achieve desirable walking velocities, step length, safety and comfort while consequentially reducing the physical testing on patients and consequentially reduce physical testing on patients.},

  abstract={As AI algorithms become increasingly integrated into social media platforms, concerns regarding their ethical implications have grown. This research paper examines the ethical use of AI in social media, focusing on three key areas: content moderation, user manipulation, and the spread of misinformation. We analyze the ethical concerns arising from personal, political, social, and ethical biases embedded within AI algorithms. The paper highlights the challenges of striking a balance between human moderation and algorithmic enforcement, as well as the need to address biases in the decision-making process. We delve into the complexities of content moderation, including the unintended consequences of algorithmic enforcement and the ethical debates surrounding content removal. The paper also explores user manipulation tactics employed in social media and the ethical considerations necessary to protect and empower users against manipulation. Furthermore, we examine AI's role in spreading misinformation and the ethical challenges of detecting and combatting false information while avoiding unintended amplification. To address these ethical concerns, we discuss potential solutions such as enhancing transparency, promoting fairness, and empowering users with control over their AI -driven experiences. Additionally, we present case studies and examples to provide practical insights into the complex ethical landscape of AI in social media. The research paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in AI usage and suggesting future directions for research, collaboration, policy development, and responsible innovation. By addressing the ethical challenges posed by AI algorithms, we can foster an ethical and responsible environment for social media users and ensure that AI serves the best interests of individuals and society.},

  abstract={When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread adoption in healthcare applications and services. The global pandemic has further hastened the integration of AI into telehealth services, such as service quality improvement and new models of care. This paper focuses on the service quality improvement of telehealth, specifically, cancer information and telephone support services, in terms of its human system interaction. We present an AI framework for the detection of patient emotions and emotion transitions based on call recordings of telehealth services. The call recordings are typically a conversation between the caller (patient or carer) and the healthcare practitioner (nurse or counsellor). All primary emotions are expressed across diverse topics during these calls. It is anticipated that the caller emotion state improves during the call due to the information and support received. The proposed AI framework is designed to detect emotions expressed at all stages of the call and based on these expressions, formulate the emotion transition during the call. We have evaluated the proposed AI framework on a large real-world dataset of 60,000 call recordings of cancer information and telephone support services provided by Cancer Council Victoria, Australia. The results confirm the effectiveness of this AI framework in detection of emotions and emotion transitions during the provision of telehealth services.},

  abstract={Hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs) have been shown to have the potential to improve the interpretability of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs).

In this article, an initial framework to measure the interpretability of HFSs is proposed, combined with a participatory user design process to create a specific instance of the framework for an application context. This approach enables the subjective views of a range of practitioners, experts in the design and creation of FLSs, to be taken into account in shaping the design of a generic framework for measuring interpretability in HFSs. This design process and framework are demonstrated through two classification application examples, showing the ability of the resulting index to appropriately capture interpretability as perceived by system design experts.},

  abstract={Engaging in interdisciplinary projects on the intersection between visualization and humanities research can be a challenging endeavor. Challenges can be finding valuable outcomes for both domains, or how to apply state-of-the-art visual analytics methods like supervised machine learning algorithms. We discuss these challenges when working with cultural heritage data. Further, there is a gap in applying these methods to intangible heritage. To give a reflection on some interdisciplinary projects, we present three case studies focusing on the labeling of cultural heritage collections, the problems and challenges with the data, the participatory design process, and takeaways for the visualization scholars from these collaborations.},

  abstract={The success of the interaction between the robotics community and the users of these services is an aspect of considerable importance in the drafting of the development plan of any technology. This aspect becomes even more relevant when dealing with sensitive services and issues such as those related to interaction with specific subgroups of any population. Over the years, there have been few successes in integrating and proposing technologies related to deafness and sign language. Instead, in this paper, we propose an account of successful interaction between a signatory robot and the Italian deaf community, which occurred during the Smart City Robotics Challenge (SciRoc) 2021 competition1. Thanks to the use of a participatory design and the involvement of experts belonging to the deaf community from the early stages of the project, it was possible to create a technology that has achieved significant results in terms of acceptance by the community itself and could lead to significant results in the technology development as well.},

  abstract={Machine learning research today is dominated by a technocentric perspective and in many cases disconnected from the users of the technology. The machine teaching paradigm instead shifts the focus from machine learning experts towards the domain experts and users of machine learning technology. This shift opens up for new perspectives on the current use of machine learning as well as new usage areas to explore. In this study, we apply and map existing machine teaching principles onto a contextual machine teaching implementation in a commuting setting. The aim is to highlight areas in machine teaching theory that requires more attention. The main contribution of this work is an increased focus on available features, the features space and the potential to transfer some of the domain expert's explanatory powers to the machine learning system.},

By using WebGIS, cloud computing, with remote sensing data, engineering design data and real sense 3D modeling, this method will create a platform for substation (converter) stations and transmission lines with visualization of 3D models, progress query and process control, etc. This new method will create a closed-loop for line feasibility study design results and online business management. Furthermore, it will accumulate engineering digital results dynamically and provides sustainable services in the follow-up projects. By using this new application, the collaborative design and lean management level of UHV projects will be efficiently improved.},

The resulting structure of created ontologies is described together with generic process models that enable a semantic composition and orchestration of electronic services in the analyzed courses. Added semantics allows a flexible integration of educational services and processes, which consequently may help educators to minimize their efforts when preparing and running new instances of courses or lectures, as well as to effectively analyze the students' performance and the teaching process as whole.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer, and it has a dismal prognosis. It represents about 30 % (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year. As a result, there is a pressing need to create efficient and quick computational approaches for breast cancer prognosis. In this study, a multimodal deep learning model that enables decision-making on data from multiple data sources is proposed and used with three different classifiers. We achieved 82% accuracy in decision trees, 90% in random forests and 88% in support vector machines. We have seen that the results we get from the combined data are more successful than the distinct convolutional neural network models we have run separately before. Combining diverse data sources for the successful application of multimodal deep learning algorithms appears to be an effective strategy to improve human breast cancer prediction performance.},

  abstract={When applying machine learning (ML) based techniques to time-series forecasting applications, there are many domain-specific considerations that can be integrated into model development to improve the likelihood of successful real-world translation. A human-centered approach, that involves end-users, has the potential to address commonly cited concerns such as algorithmic trust, explainability, and fairness. We present the DelphAI framework as an example of a practical human-centered approach to ML-based time-series forecasting for applications where end-users have little familiarity with ML techniques. The proposed socio-technical methodology incorporates essential domain knowledge through stakeholder participation into the development of predictive models. We advocate that the application of user-centered design principles can improve downstream translation and address other ethical concerns associated with ML-based forecasting.},

  abstract={The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in manufacturing has become increasingly common, but the lack of transparency and interpretability of AI models can limit their adoption in critical applications, due to lack of human understanding. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a solution to this problem by providing insights into the decision-making process of AI models. This paper analyses different approaches for AI transparency and interpretability, starting from explainability by-design to post-hoc explainability, pointing out trade-offs, advantages and disadvantages of each one, as well as providing an overview of different applications in manufacturing processes. The paper concludes presenting XMANAI as an innovative platform for manufacturing users to develop insightful XAI pipelines that can assist in their everyday operations and decision-making. The comprehensive overview of methods here presented serves as the ground basis for the platform draft catalogue of XAI models.},

The Vedic framework is put up as a blueprint for building a harmonious and all- encompassing society, with a focus on civic participation and teamwork. In this paper, it is suggested that emerging technologies like blockchain, IoT, and AI will make it possible to build a just and sustainable society. The idea emphasises the necessity of a cooperative strategy combining authorities, corporations, and communities to guarantee that the advantages of technological breakthroughs are spread fairly and that no segment of society is left behind. By utilising technology to address societal difficulties, this idea seeks to build a sustainable, intelligent society that upholds cultural values and fosters social fairness.},

Therefore, a process model based on DevOps, known from software development, was created to allow iterative and digital engineering in hardware design. According to a case study concerned, this process model allows to accept changes during development at a later point in time and enable iterative testing.

  abstract={Machine learning components are increasingly being included in the so-called machine learning enabled software systems. Machine learning and software engineering communities have agreed in that it is necessary to consider the particular aspects and issues that arise from the development and deployment of such systems, especially when related to software architecture. In relation to software architecture, architecture evaluation is a relatively mature area which is seen as inextricable with any architecture design. However, we believe machine learning and software engineering communities have not given enough attention to the evaluation of software architectures of machine learning enabled software. We propose in this paper a set of aspects that should be attended in order to enact a machine learning enabled software architecture evaluation such as the diversity of stakeholders’ knowledge. We designed, planned, run and report a case study in which the case was the evaluation of a white matter brain lesions segmentation machine learning enabled system using the Decison-Centric Architecture Review (DCAR) method. In this paper we report some of the decisions that were reviewed and changed, along with interesting insights regarding factors that influence software architecture evaluation adoption in this topic. We conclude and suggest in this paper that both machine learning and software architecture research and practitioner communities should start considering the study of software architecture evaluations in the context of machine learning enabled software architectures.},

  abstract={Software effort estimation is a necessary component of software development projects that belong to industrial software systems and digital transformation initiatives. Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technology into various components of a company or organization in order to improve operations, procedures, customer experiences, and overall performance. Industrial software systems are trained software packages designed for use in industrial and manufacturing processes. The paper deals with the machine learning based effort estimation in order to create an effective and robust model for predicting effort. The paper proposes an Omni-Ensemble Learning (OEL) approach, which is a combination of static ensemble selection along with genetic algorithm and dynamic ensemble selection. The paper identifies the impact of software effort estimation in industrial software system, and works on the these attributes to implement a robust ensemble model. The proposed Omni-Ensemble Selection (OES) provides better overall performance (in terms of evaluation metrics) and on comparing with multiple machine learning models over Finnish and Maxwell datasets.},

  abstract={Traditionally both Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Human Factors disciplines have tended to utilise their own methods and tools in order to achieve the design of Human-Machine Teams (HMT), with little interaction between the two approaches. However, in order to address both human and machine both disciplines can bring the design team together. In this paper we propose a shared co-design approach for HMT that facilitates a better understanding of system requirements and user interaction. By focusing on context rich scenarios and asking end users to walk through decisions they would make using the system it is possible for both AI and HF team members to obtain critical design information for the HMT. System intent and transparency are essential components within the HMT paradigm, and thus play a central role within the design team. This is particularly relevant when multiple AIs are involved in a decision that is then mediated by the machine. In such instances, the human component is a fundamental component and will often be required to approve or maintain awareness of the decision being generated. This is discussed using examples of user interface design and how the human can be embraced within such AI mediations.},

Aiming at the problems of low resource reuse and difficult deployment in traditional simulation software resource allocation, an improved GA algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal mapping between simulation model and virtual machine. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively avoid premature algorithm, and with the improvement of resource utilization, it can provide better load balancing effect. The practicability and convenience of CAE process product design software and the feasibility and effectiveness of development method are verified.

  abstract={Staff engagement in the work environment is vital to organizational success. Engaged staff are motivated and indulged in their work as they have a sense of belonging, commitment, and loyalty toward their employer, which eventually leads to better performance and outcomes. While various organizational factors are related to staff engagement, limited research is available regarding what drives staff engagement and the degree of their importance in healthcare. Leveraging data-driven approaches, in this article, we employ three machine learning algorithms, random forests, gradient boosting, and extra trees, to identify the relative importance of organizational factors affecting staff engagement. We use hospital-level aggregate survey data from hospitals in the U.K. While staff engagement is the outcome variable, the following factors are used as organizational factors in the prediction model and feature importance analysis: equality, diversity, and inclusion, safety culture, health and wellbeing, immediate managers, quality of appraisals, quality of care, bullying and harassment, violence, and team working. All the algorithms provide comparable prediction results with similar feature importance ranking with respect to prediction accuracy. The results suggest that safety culture is the most influential factor related to staff engagement, followed by the team working. Healthcare managers and decision makers can benefit from this data-driven application to make informed decisions in resource allocation and prioritization efforts to improve staff engagement.},

  abstract={The use of data analytics and Machine Learning (ML) branches of AI for predictive and analytic knowledge retrieval has surged significantly in various industries (e.g., health, finance, business, and manufacturing). However, the acceptance of AI has been hindered by opaque models that lack transparency. Explainability in AI (XAI) has gained significant prominence owing to its focus on introducing avenues of accountability in AI. XAI acknowledges the importance of human factors and strives to incorporate them into the design process, recognising that the cognitive effort involved in understanding explanations is a key aspect. Mental Models play a crucial role in the XAI evaluative premise, but their current utility is limited. By intentionally designing explanations that align with users’ mental models, their experiences can be significantly enhanced, leading to improved understanding, satisfaction, trust, and performance. This study proposes using Mental Models to elicit explainability requirements and to develop an Ontology-Driven Conceptual Model to facilitate the learning process for a better understanding of explanations.},

  abstract={Development and Operations (DevOps), a particular type of Continuous Software Engineering, has become a popular Software System Engineering paradigm. Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.},

  abstract={This paper discusses principles and practices that can optimize artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching and learning from the perspectives of leading organizational change and by reimaging learning activities with AI as a collaborative partner. Based on the Kowch's participatory teaching and learning (PTL) principles for networked organizations, the authors analyze the integration of new talent patterns emerging in more agile interdisciplinary education systems connected through information and technologies, and propose principles for collaboration through machines as AI participants and principles for designing new education systems where the teams with AI can thrive. Taking a different angle from the traditional linear education system design tasks and education institution redesigns, the proposed principles assume more time for education and training leaders to take stronger leadership roles in the creation of better teams with AI augmentation. We offer principles for designing education institutions that are capable of adapting with these innovations and we also offer principles for designing these next generation learning environments. Finally by "zooming in" on instruction and AI, we use Activity theory to imagine better inclusions of social and cultural components with AI as an important, emerging, and unscripted new partner.},

  abstract={Majority of the rural population in India rely on agriculture as their major source of income. Due to the unforeseen circumstances and changes pertinent to season, demographics, geopolitical, etc., growth in the agricultural sector has been very constrained, thus keeping the majority below the poverty line. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or MGNREGA, is an Indian labor law that strives to guarantee the ‘right to work. It is a social security measure with a goal to improve livelihood of the adults in the rural areas by providing at least 100 days of unskilled labor work. However, its efficiency is hampered by the inability to accurately track the work on a regular basis. Absence of third-party contractors may be financially beneficial, but it is causing a growing discontentment within the rural households. This paper summarizes two years of rigorous field work and articulates field experience and challenges with the MGNREGA scheme implementation in Dunda village, located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India. The systemic and contextual causes are explored while our stay with the rural community and studied using participatory and user centric methods. This paper presents and proposes a viable solution developed using collaborative approach with the rural workers and village officials in-charge of the scheme's implementation. A wearable smart device to monitor the on-field activity of workers is proposed. A centralized worker report database to record workdays generated by each worker and task details is also proposed. Further, details about task progress and worker compensation can be regulated. It is expected that this sort of activity tracking device will improve the transparency of the process and restore confidence in the MGNREGA scheme at the grassroots.},

  abstract={Visual Analytics (VA) is a process to facilitate the uncovering of knowledge from large and complex datasets to enable users to make informed decisions. However, the design of VA tools is frequently performed by multidisciplinary teams that can be physically in the same place or distributed across different locations. Therefore, there is an intrinsic collaboration need between team members and also of proposing methods to support these teams to work collaboratively during the design and implementation of VA systems. Although some proposals have made on the use of visual data flows and recommender systems, its combination with a Multi-Device Environment can benefit the discussion and exchange of knowledge during design and programming. Therefore, this article presents the design of an architecture that combines a Multi-Device Environment (MDE) with visual data flows and recommender systems for the design of VA tools in a collaborative way. The intention is to support designers and programmers during the design of visual data flows through the sharing and analysis of ideas in a collaborative environment supported by a recommender system that aids decision making during the design of flows.},

On the surface, the process lacks the usual discipline that most engineers are used to, but operationally it has the potential of bringing capabilities to operations at a quicker rate. The goal of providing continuously updated services should make sure that the overall enterprise performance and security posture are not compromised while the quick turnaround capability deployment is achieved.

  abstract={This paper surveys the recent developments and future research opportunities in computer supported cooperative work in design. This domain of interest has been variously conceptualized and described in different publications. There is a broader interpretation that considers the entirety of product lifecycle as a target domain and aims at a holistic optimization of all related engineering processes by connecting them through design. There exists a narrower interpretation that concentrates on the enhancement of the product conceptualization and creative design activities in distributed, multidisciplinary and volatile environments. The former is most frequently referred to as collaborative engineering and the latter as collaborative design. The paper concentrates on collaborative design and investigates the concepts, advancements and issues from: (i) philosophical and theoretical, (ii) technological and infrastructural, (iii) organizational and methodological, (iv) social and cultural, (v) cognitive and behavioral perspectives. Based on literature sources and the own work of the author in the last three decades, it provides a broadly-based analysis of the related concepts, knowledge, means, systems and concerns in current research, development and application with the objective to point towards future progression opportunities. The paper identifies a gradual shift in the research interest from the technological and procedural aspects to the socio-cultural, inter-personal and informational aspects. It proposes that collaborative design is eventually about people and that mobile, ubiquitous and smart technologies create many new opportunities for conducting collaborative design. Semantics, pragmatics and apobetics of inter-personal interaction and communication play a key role in the success of collaborative design.},

We show that the reality is more nuanced; machine learning can be expected to induce types of bias not found in the training data. In particular, if different groups have different optimal models, and the optimal model for one group has higher accuracy, the optimal accuracy joint model will induce disparate impact even when the training data does not display disparate impact. We argue that due to systemic bias, this is a likely situation, and simply ensuring training data appears unbiased is insufficient to ensure fair machine learning.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The reviving of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is changing our lives due to the superior performance in computer vision, nature language processing, and decision making and control tasks. Recently, computing in memristor (CIM) technology is considered as an unconventional approach to meet the urgent needs of high computing efficiency and throughput in continuously developing AI applications. In contrast to von Neumann architecture, computing in memristor technology avoids the data movement between computing units (such as CPU and GPU) and memory unit which would greatly reduce computing latency and power consumption. Memristor is one kind of novel non-volatile memory devices which could not only store information with multi-bit, but also conduct core computing operations of AI algorithm. Assembling memristors in a crossbar structure, it could carry out in-situ parallel multiply-accumulation (MAC) computation. To make the best use of the memristors in neuromorphic systems, a memristor-friendly architecture and the software-hardware collaborative design methods are essential, and the key challenge is how to utilize the memristor’s analog behavior. The talk will discuss recent development of analog computing in memory technology from device engineering, circuit design and architecture optimization perspectives. Further, the system and technology co-optimization (STCO) method is proposed to fully unleash the potential of CIM for practical applications.},

  abstract={The AI revolution has brought significant changes to society. AI-powered systems can analyze enormous amounts of data to optimize processes, improve accuracy, and cut costs. Nevertheless, addressing potential hazards and ethical issues related to AI enabled technologies, such as bias and job displacement, is essential. This paper presented an example of an AI revolution threatening cyber security, the ChatGPT. ChatGPT, a chatbot, can generate essays or code on demand. However, ChatGPT's security system can be circumvented or deceived to generate malicious content. Moreover, these AI enabled tools to have design issues, e.g., accuracy issues. As a result, ChatGPT can be accused of violating the confidentiality of information (privacy invasion), producing inaccurate information, and potentially facilitating attack tool generation that can compromise the availability principle of the CIA triad. This paper presents ChatGPT as a threat against the CIA triad principle by focusing on violating these principles.},

  abstract={This study investigates how risk influences users' trust before and after interactions with technologies such as autonomous vehicles (AVs'). Also, the psychophysiological correlates of users' trust from users” eletrodermal activity responses. Eighteen (18) carefully selected participants embark on a hypothetical trip playing an autonomous vehicle driving game. In order to stay safe, throughout the drive experience under four risk conditions (very high risk, high risk, low risk and no risk) that are based on automotive safety and integrity levels (ASIL D, C, B, A), participants exhibit either high or low trust by evaluating the AVs' to be highly or less trustworthy and consequently relying on the Artificial intelligence or the joystick to control the vehicle. The result of the experiment shows that there is significant increase in users' trust and user's delegation of controls to AVs' as risk decreases and vice-versa. In addition, there was a significant difference between user's initial trust before and after interacting with AVs' under varying risk conditions. Finally, there was a significant correlation in users' psychophysiological responses (electrodermal activity) when exhibiting higher and lower trust levels towards AVs'. The implications of these results and future research opportunities are discussed.},

Learners in any domain need educators/experts to provide knowledge and guidance by relaying relevant and timely information. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as chatbots or conversational agents, can support information delivery. However, user-centric frameworks for designing chatbot learning applications and collaborative user-centric design methodologies are lacking. This paper describes a chatbot design tool to promote co-creation through crowd-based data collection and design.

  abstract={This paper conducts a study of input-sensitivity in collaborative graph algorithms for CPU-GPU systems with support for Unified Memory. The study, conducted on an extensive set of real-world graphs from the Koblenz Network, identifies three main sources of performance inefficiencies that are influenced by characteristics of the input graph. We develop autotuning methods to specifically address these inefficiencies. We then explore machine learning approaches to characterize the relationship between input graph properties, performance, and optimization parameters. In applying our learned models to a test dataset of 70 real-world graphs on the problems of breadth-first search (BFS) and single-source shortest path (SSSP), we are able to attain 96.33% of the peak performance on BFS, and 99.40% on SSSP when using the top-3 predictions of a neural network. We also attain 95.63% of the peak performance on BFS when using three decision trees trained on different categories of graphs. The performance of the learned models is superior to selecting the most frequent optimal configuration, indicating that the machine learning models were able to successfully correlate our selected configuration parameters with graph attributes.},

  abstract={Improving analysis of market basket data requires the development of approaches that lead to recommendation systems that are tailored to specifically benefit grocery chain. The main purpose of that is to find relationships existing among the sales of the products that can help retailer identify new opportunities for cross-selling their products to customers. This paper aims to discover knowledge patterns hidden in large data set that can yield more understanding to the data holders and identify new opportunities for imperative tasks including strategic planning and decision making. This paper delivers a strategy for the implementation of a systematic analysis framework built on the established principles used in data mining and machine learning. The primary goal of that is to form the foundation of what we envisage will be a new recommendation system in the market. Uniquely, our strategy seeks to implement data mining tools that will allow the analyst to interact with the data and address business questions such as promotions advertisement. We employ Apriori algorithm and support vector machine to implement our recommendation systems. Experiments are done using a real market dataset and the 0.632+ bootstrap method is used here in order to evaluate our framework. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework will be able to generate benefits for grocery chain using a real-world grocery store data.},

  abstract={The reverse design of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) using AI has received significant attention in recent years. To quickly optimize the fundamental optical properties of PCFs and obtain the optimal design combination, researchers have favored machine learning algorithms. However, relying solely on the knowledge provided by a few experts has limited the versatility and performance of these models. To address these issues, we propose a collaborative PCF property optimization framework as a new paradigm for reverse design. This framework allows experts from different institutions to share their design knowledge and collaboratively optimize the fundamental optical properties of PCFs without direct data interaction. Additionally, this framework can adapt to low-resourced computing devices that only use a small dataset without any data augmentation methods to achieve excellent optimization performance. Our proposed framework provides a novel and practical platform for global collaboration among research institutions for the reverse design of micro-structured fibers.},

  abstract={As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly popular, developers without deep experience in ML - who we will refer to as ML practitioners - are facing the need to diagnose problems with ML models. Yet successful diagnosis requires high-level expertise that practitioners lack. As in many complex data-oriented domains, visualization could help. This two-phase study explored the design of visualizations to aid ML diagnosis. In phase 1, twelve ML practitioners were asked to diagnose a model using ten state-of-the-art visualizations; seven design themes were identified. In phase 2, several design themes were embodied in an interactive visualization. The visualization was used to engage practitioners in a participatory design exercise that explored how they would carry out multi-step diagnosis using the visualization. Our findings provide design implications for tools that better support ML diagnosis by non-expert practitioners.},

  abstract={The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought forward new digital tools that have had a wide impact across society. However, AI digital tools (such as ChatGPT, midjourney, DALL-E 2) have brought forward legal and ethical concerns. — Internationally, public, and private leaders are introducing regulatory frameworks to address data governance for such these AI digital tools (i.e., Global Data Protection Regulation, the European AI Act, Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, NIST Risk Management Framework, etc.). We recognize that these AI digital tools are a vital aspect of future technological development, but they require input from various sectors in addressing ethics and compliance design. We survey the current landscape of published AI-specific regulatory frameworks and known engineering design process methods. Using a product lifecycle approach, we also introduce a trans-disciplinary framework to address AI ethics and compliance via design. This product lifecycle approach considers several principles: a Human-Centered Design for Risk Assessment, Functional Safety and Risk Management Standardization, and Continuous Governance throughout Product Lifecycle. Establishing risk management throughout AI product lifecycles can ensure accountability for AI product use cases. In addition, by utilizing previous Functional Safety considerations we can create safety mechanisms throughout the product lifecycle of AI digital tools. Finally, establishing in-field testing for continuous governance will enable the flexibility for new compliance standards and transparency. We establish this governance framework to aid in new compliance strategies for these emerging issues with AI digital tools.},

  abstract={In today’s world, digital platforms such as social media have become one of the most influential media sources. This may give an impact on company reputation due to massive user-generated content. However, due to its vast volume and unstructured nature, manual classification of these digital contents is difficult. Previous studies, evaluate corporate reputation using machine learning-focused mostly on positive, neutral, and negative aspects and lacking the multidimensional nature of corporate reputation. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore the integration of the domain ontology approach with machine learning approaches to achieve multi-dimensional classification for online corporate reputation. Overall research route to measure corporate reputation in social media is discussed. The proposed research route starts from retrieving corporate content from digital media for selected domain, next preprocessing data before topics and bag-of-words generated from the extracted data and mapping according to corporate reputation dimensions. The proposed approach is expected to produce a framework for an online corporate reputation that can be used across multiple business domains.},

  abstract={Polynomial multiplication is widely used in communication, signal and image processing. In practical application, the system often needs to process a large amount of data efficiently and then output the results. However, since polynomials are always multivariable and large-scale, software algorithms alone are not effective to meet the actual requestments. In addition, the key to polynomial multiplication is the operation of matrix multiplication. Nevertheless, due to the increasingly complex structure of matrix multiplication, it is challenging to realize efficient processing and calculation of large matrices. With the development of FPGA, LSI manufacturing, memory interface and EDA tools, it is possible to apply hardware to the polynomial multiplication. To solve the above problems, we have designed and implemented a polynomial multiplication platform based on FPGA, which combines hardware and software to make up for the shortcomings of current software algorithms and at the same time, it can efficiently and effectively operate polynomial multiplication.},
