  abstract={Current trends in the design of road systems are driven by the digitalization process. Work on the introduction of intelligent transport systems is being carried out all over the world, because the improvement of the road network is an important element in creating comfortable conditions for the movement of people in an urbanized environment; a tool for improving road safety. Based on interdisciplinary research methods in the framework of urban planning, the paper proposes a methodology for assessing the prospects for the development of an intelligent city transport system within the framework of the concept of participatory design. The formation of the transport system is seen as a process of coordination of institutional and civil needs. The goal of the joint work of urban planners and civil society is to improve the safety of road infrastructure, not only through the development and implementation of quality standards, but also through the internalization (recognition) of the value of new technologies by the society. It is necessary to introduce the principles of participatory design of the transport system into the development of the road network, the urban space should remain free for co-creation. The problem of the study is that technologies for improving road safety, including the use of artificial intelligence, automation systems for traffic management processes depending on the rhythm of the city, weather conditions, time of day (traffic flow detectors, CCTV cameras, "smart traffic lights", weather stations, vehicle traffic sensors, navigation information systems, weather information display systems, environmental pollution sensors, traffic control centers, etc.) can be perceived by citizens primarily as devices that restrict freedom of movement, and not as means of improving road safety},

  abstract={There has been a tremendous growth of digital health applications within healthcare. Clinicians are inundated with new types of data to synthesize in a timely manner to make a clinical decisions about the care of their patients. The overwhelming abundance of data leads to physician burnout, which is a major problem within healthcare. In parallel, there is an immense hype building up about implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, to augment clinician decision making processes. Healthcare is a highly regulated environment so it's imperative to involve clinicians and data scientists in the entire model development, validation and implementation lifecycle. There ought to be a mechanism in place for integration of human feedback to build trust in the AI model, through human in the loop implementation models and participatory design approaches. The overarching aim of this stury is to formulate a problem statement and propose the development a system dynamics model highlighting the feedback loops within clinical decision-making workflows leading to diffusion of innovation of AI within healthcare. We propose system dynamics modelling as a mechanism to articulate the problems that are best suited for AI models, and conceptualize how the models would fit into the current workflow.},

  abstract={At present, it is difficult to handle unexpected exceptions in collaborative design. Ad-hoc methods are important ones, but how to utilize the expert experience efficiently, especially, store those in structured format and not to lose any information and interact under more user-friendly interface during handling exceptions, seem a mission impossible. Aiming at those, we proposed a question answering mechanism based approach for handling unexpected exceptions in collaborative design, which have some good characteristics, 1) unexpected exception handling is treated as a question answering mechanism so as to be more user-friendly, 2) in which exception handler can use natural language to define an exception; 3) expert experience are stored in natural language, there is no information loss; 4) higher efficiency, extendability and precision. In this paper, two approaches for mining similar records are proposed, and their performance comparison is shown},

  abstract={In order to improve the manufacturability of products and enhance the efficiency of communication during the co-design process, it is important to focus on the problem of inconsistent representation of concepts in the design and manufacturing domains; In the co-design process, it is important to consider the management of relevant data, such as the management of data upload, modification and access rights. Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a framework for dual fusion of knowledge data in co-design based on blockchain and ontology methods. Firstly, the ontology method is used to establish the framework for knowledge unification, and the knowledge and concepts in the design and manufacturing fields are unified so as to realize the purpose of concept unification and meet the needs of efficient communication. Secondly, the blockchain method is used to establish the data management system. Through signing the smart contract, the use authority of the data involved is limited, so as to realize the data fusion in the co-design process. In the co-design process, parallel and integrated design and manufacturing processes can be realized, and product manufacturability and communication efficiency between designers and manufacturing engineers can be improved through knowledge fusion and data fusion.},

  abstract={The Participatory Design and End-User Program-ming for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) workshop aims to advance research on how to design systems that can be used by end users to program robots. There tends to be a fracture in HRI between the technical designers of robot programs (often engineers or computer scientists) and the actual users of such robots. Developers have the capabilities to program robots but often lack insights possessed by domain experts, sometimes leading to technically interesting but impractical systems. With this workshop, we aim to bridge two different methods often used individually within the wider HRI community to involve end users in robot program design: Participatory Design (PD) and End-User Programming (EUP). Both methods empower end users to co-produce robots addressing real-world needs. However, there have been limited opportunities to unite researchers who specialize in these areas and engage in mutual learning. We will address this shortcoming with a full-day workshop, which will put the PD and EUP communities in touch, inviting speakers from both sides and welcoming a wide range of publications from describing new end-user programming methods to compiling insights learned from conducting participatory design studies.},

The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) report [1] highlighted the need to "establish justified confidence in AI systems," and further acknowledged that "the United States will field safe and reliable AI…" through the execution of existing procedures. This acknowledgment reinforces the prevailing thought from the U.S. Army Combat Capability Development Command Armaments Center (DEVCOM AC) that there are robust processes in place to mitigate risks, such as the Army Materiel Release (MR) process, but the key is how to tailor them to ensure continued application.The Materiel Release process, which ensure systems are safe, suitable, and supportable, as written may be a challenging process to adhere to by AI-enabled projects. There are facets of the AI technology that currently make it difficult to proceed through the process. The authors spent years engaged with MR stakeholders, board members, coordinator, and chair to identify the prevailing concerns, risks, and proposed mitigations, which eventually formed into a roadmap to properly and thoroughly review an AI enabled system. The validated roadmap has helped reduce risks, educate stakeholders, identify gaps, and suggest future solutions to both the process and products to ensure safety, suitability, and supportability to the Warfighter and DoD mission.},

  abstract={In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of press and attention. Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles. The author's aim is to set out obstacles and realistic alternatives for next generation project managers to apply AI in managing stakeholder expectations, resolving dissent and conflicts, and assuring flawless project delivery.},

  pages={233-237},
  abstract={The collaborative design is an important style for modern design. But the conflict appears in the process of design which may interface the design. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a good method for conflict resolution, which has been applied in the artificial intelligence field successfully. However, due to the uncertainties in knowledge representation, attribute description, and similarity measures of CBR, it is very difficult to find the similar cases from case database. To solve the problem of conflict resolution in collaborative design, a fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. The process of fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is introduced. Based on the feature attributes and their relative weights determined by a fuzzy technique, a fuzzy CBR retrieving mechanism is developed to retrieve conflict resolution cases that tend to enhance the functions of the database. The theory and methods of fuzzy CBR is applied to define the cases. By indexing, calculating the weight and defuzzication of the cases, the case similarity can be obtained. Then the case consistency is measured to keep the result right. Finally, the method is demonstrated availably for conflict resolution by means of a case study.},

  abstract={Integrate multidisciplinary virtual teams in collaborative design process is a hard task to tackle with. Differences of background, culture and expertise usually lead to conflicting situations. Moreover, if we consider to be working on a synchronous environment — where all designers exchange data and share information at the same time that the product design is being done — potential knowledge representation conflicts can also arise from this process. In our work we currently represent knowledge in collaborative design by using Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is structured to be a major formalism for the design and dissemination of ontology information. The use of OWL reasoning is intended to be a consistent way to verify the information given by several experts, trying to avoid redundancies, contradictions and misunderstood. This paper presents an approach to detect collaborative design conflicts through the use of an OWL inference engine.},

  abstract={This article describes the concept of knowledge integration in a 3D collaborative virtual environment. This concept characterizes collaborative design in terms of two models introduced in this article -an annotation model with a semantic metadata notion - and a knowledge model to capitalize and to manage annotations - MATRICS environment. We briefly describe this approach. Then we present the results of an empirical study in which subjects performed annotation tasks with the support of an ontology visualization 2D tool and through the navigation in the 3D annotations. This study shows that the knowledge model improves the quality of the understanding of design projects.},

  abstract={Recent advancements of technologies, including computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization technologies, bring us closer to futuristic visions of compassionate intelligent devices. The missing element is a basic understanding of how to relate human functions (physiological, physical, and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people. Our stakeholder and clinician consultants identified a number of mobility barriers that have been intransigent to traditional approaches. The most important physical obstacles are stairs, steps, curbs, doorways (doors), rough/uneven surfaces, weather hazards (snow, ice), crowded/cluttered spaces, and confined spaces. Focus group participants suggested a number of ways to make interaction simpler, including natural language interfaces such as the ability to say ";I want a drink";, a library of high level commands (open a door, park the wheelchair, ...), and a touchscreen interface with images so the user could point and use other gestures.},

In a manufacture system, a good method can be captured to model the process of collaborative design. But the present process modeling techniques are not sufficient to model the process, which is are IDEF, UML and ARIS. Colored Petri nets is proposed to model the whole process of the collaborative design. The process of collaborative design is a dynamic process and the colored Petri nets can describe the process. The allocation of task, the conflict resolution and other processes are all expressed in the model. The result suggests that the model is suit to express the process of design and it is good to know the whole process of collaborative design. By doing it, the system can be realized successfully.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) literacy has recently been identified as one of critical skills students need to succeed as future creators and innovators. While the significance of introducing ML basics at kindergarten to twelfth grade (K-12) levels is increasingly acknowledged, there is limited research that focuses specifically on collaborative design of ML applications with middle school students. We posit that engaging young children to co-invent and make concrete prototypes improves their ideas, encourages them to become active participants, and allows them to establish the implications of the technology in their everyday lives. In order to lay the foundation for middle school ML education, we collaboratively designed and prototyped ML applications with 43 eighth grade students (ages 11 to 14) in a Nigerian school. The ideas generated by the students indicate that they began to identify the applicability of ML to their daily lives and as a solution to a plethora of societal challenges. This study provides learners’ input and preliminary insights into approaches that could be adopted to promote ML within the compulsory level of education in an African setting. The research contributes to the limited body of knowledge available on effectively teaching ML to young learners using design-oriented pedagogy, especially in the context of an emerging country.},

  abstract={We are living in an ageing population with an escalation in chronic illnesses including dementia and other age related diseases. People living with dementia often continue to live at home and are supported by caregivers and next of kin. It is often important to monitor the wellbeing of people living with dementia in order to measure their level of independence and to provide proper support at the time of need as well as supporting their quality of life. Some researchers have focused on monitoring physical wellbeing and activities of daily living (ADL). However, there has been a paucity of research focussed on monitoring mood, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia, despite these people experiencing frustration, agitation, depression and social isolation to name but a few known effects. As a result, the SenseCare project aims to build an affective computing platform that uses sensors placed in the home environment to monitor moods, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia. This platform is being iteratively designed and will likely use plug-n-play sensors such as passive infrared, wearables and camera technologies to infer emotions from facial expressions, voice intonations and physical behaviour and other modalities. However, it is important to interact iteratively with people living with dementia and their caregivers in order to understand their profound needs. In this study, we report on two focus groups that were conducted to elicit user stories and eventual requirements for the SenseCare platform. Since participatory design involving people living with dementia could bring about unique challenges, we adopted a dyad approach where a caregiver and the person living with dementia participate together in the focus group. This ensures that their needs are fully represented and that consent is fully transparent. In this paper, we report the personal stories elicited during these discussions which will ultimately inform the implementation of the SenseCare platform.},

The pipeline was able to ingest demographic data and near real-time continuous physiological data, run through a model, and output the results twice a day automatically. It was a highly collaborative effort among clinical neurologists, the research team, and the IT innovation team. We illustrate the technical run time challenges and mitigations in each of the three components of the pipeline: data, model (modular), and output communication.

  abstract={It has been many years now the concept of smart city evolved, with the beginning of a new era in urban innovation called Smart cities. Since that time there has been many studies made to discuss and understand this new concept with its application and acceptance worldwide. It is very obvious that smart cities will make things much complex but also ease our life style with high-tech solutions at the urban context. The study discusses various smart initiatives of top three ranked smart cities (London, Singapore & Seoul) by the smart government and the user experience. However research still fall short to understand the success of participatory design in use of smart concepts and the smart knowledge in day-to-day life. Policy makers and practitioners both need to deal with these progressive developments and digital connections. One example of this is the popular anonymous England based street artist who is known for his satirical street art regarding political activism, social causes and ironic realities of civic life. This work can truly be experienced in person yet does not require any digital media to enhance the experience. In order to explore the recent scenario of smart cities a survey is conducted to analyze the role of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in place making of Dubai. Though smart cities bring many complexities with them but same time they also ease and improve lifestyles. IoT and AI are very essential key elements during the entire process of planning for smart cities.},

  abstract={Effective real-time network measurement provides a basis for generating routing optimization strategies, so that the network can sense congestion. The existing out of band network telemetry technology will transmit additional probes to measure the network status, which will inevitably lead to the "observer" effect, leading to inaccurate measurement information. In addition, it is difficult to describe the relationship between complex network states and routing optimization strategies with accurate mathematical models. Let some neurons stop working temporarily, reduce the interaction between neurons, implicitly delete neurons in the network, and prevent some functional synergies to alleviate excessive matching. The algorithm selects temporarily discarded neurons with random probability, while the optimization algorithm uses Ising model in machine learning data to identify neurons with low link energy, and temporarily discards these neurons in training and reasoning. This algorithm makes the model more general and effectively alleviates the over fitting problem of network training. Its purpose is to select key features closely related to the learning purpose or eliminate irrelevant features to improve the performance of the model. Feature sparse methods can be divided into two categories. And in machine learning, the use of control algorithms can effectively improve the development of machine learning, and in machine learning, the proportion of optimization using control algorithms is very large. This paper puts forward many new ideas, hoping to improve the use of machine learning control algorithm.},

  pages={590-595},
  abstract={Collaborative design entails sharing knowledge in an effective way and from a variety of sources, which raises the need of developing technology-enabled systems that can improve decision making by streamlining complex analysis and synthesis processes and facilitating communication and negotiation in the design process. While previous research predominantly focuses on a particular aspect of design knowledge, an integrated method is required to develop such systems especially in the context that the amount of data has become huge. To address such a gap, this work aims to address the two views of design knowledge, namely codification and personalisation. The main idea is to facilitate the collaborative design process with a model-based solution which uses computational methods based on codified knowledge while incorporating rich personal experience of problem-solving for decision-making. This solution requires an effective knowledge representation that facilitates the integration of explicit and tacit knowledge in the computational processes. In addition, it relies on effective system integration during these processes. This paper reports the very first step towards such a solution, describing the system integration issues and the user interaction issues in the development of a prototype system.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has been identified as a critical technology of Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) for protecting computer network systems against cyber-attacks, malware, phishing, damage, or illicit access. AI has potential in strengthening the cyber capabilities and safety of nation-states, local governments, and non-state entities through e-Governance. Existing research provides a mixed association between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity; however, this relationship is believed to be context-specific. AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity influence and are affected by various stakeholders possessing a variety of knowledge and expertise in respective areas. To fill this context specific gap, this study investigates the direct relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, this study examines the mediating role of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity and moderating effect of stakeholders involvement on the relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. The results of PLS-SEM path modeling analysis revealed a partial mediating impact of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity. Likewise, moderating influence of stakeholders involvement was discovered on the relationship between AI and e-Governance, as well as between e-Governance and cybersecurity. It implies that stakeholders involvement has vital significance in AI and e-Governance because all stakeholders have interest in vibrant, transparent, and secured cyberspace while using e-services. This study provides practical implications for governmental bodies of smart cities for strengthening their cybersecurity measures.},

  abstract={Machine learning has been pervasively used in a wide range of applications due to its technical breakthroughs in recent years. It has demonstrated significant success in dealing with various complex problems, and shows capabilities close to humans or even beyond humans. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions. Several suggestions on security evaluations of machine learning systems are also provided. Last, future directions for machine learning security are also presented.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises various sub-fields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) perform a key role in the transformation of many industries, including education. It changes traditional learning methods by using its Innovative techniques and applications. Using its applications, the teachers may keep track of each student’s development, paying close attention to the areas in which they struggle. Many researchers are working with ML and DL to exploit its discoveries and insights. In education, traditional education methods (TEM) are the same for each student, which means each student is taught in the same way as ML and DL, making this process flexible and creative for solving complex problems and enhancing productivity. Nowadays, each institution adopts E-learning methods as the primary way of learning, especially during the pandemic. Despite this evolution of creativity, delivering quality education, making strategies for analyzing performance and future goals, and career counseling for students still pose challenges. The current study aims to offer a complete overview of the significance of ML approaches in online education. To accomplish this purpose, the study synthesizes information from multiple scientific papers that investigate (a) the methodology used to construct learning analysis tools, (b) the key data resources used, and (c) the scopeÂ of data sources now available. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the research conducted between 1961 and 2022, focusing on various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Its aim is to provide insights into the applications of these techniques and offer optimal solutions to the research questions at hand.

Based on existing solutions in theory and practice as well as the results of an explorative interview study in Germany, this article shows that AI can nevertheless make a valuable contribution to improving PM. For this purpose, we present a framework that defines the fundamental concepts for applying AI to PM comprising both the requirements of AI for the application domain PM as well as the requirements of PM for the solution domain AI. Considering the two domains’ mutual requirements, the framework structures the potential for the application of AI in PM and thus supports a targeted solution design for business.},

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are respected, medical machine learning systems must be developed responsibly. Many high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations—albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations, model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge, the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments.},

  abstract={DevOps is an agile software delivery approach which combines IT development and operation functions into cross-functional teams and promotes team autonomy and automation of processes. Many companies transform their IT departments according to the DevOps paradigm, hoping to increase their pace of software delivery and achieve a tighter collaboration between business and IT functions. Whereas reasons for adopting DevOps are often described in terms of operational efficiency, the paper at hand aims to investigate whether implementing DevOps can additionally contribute to the strategic advantage of companies. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review of 37 empirical research papers on DevOps capabilities and analyzed the results in the context of the dynamic capabilities theory. Our conceptual model proposes that DevOps teams can contribute to firm competitive advantage by building both business- and technology-related capabilities which enable them to sense market opportunities, make fast and targeted decisions and transform their assets in case of changing circumstances. This research aims to generate a deeper understanding of the impact which software delivery approaches like DevOps can have on firm competitive advantage and provides insight into the sources of dynamic capabilities in modern IT organizations.},

  abstract={Technology, and specifically Artificial Intelligence, is transforming society in profound bivalent ways with positive and negative impacts. There is a recognition that AI offers immense potential for improving human well-being, which has been formulated at length from many perspectives, including the economic, social, psychological, developmental, and health perspectives. Critical questions with regards to these AI for well-being systems are, “What does success as far as employing AI to support human well-being look like?” and perhaps more importantly, “How do we inform system development processes to ensure the said success?” AI ethical frameworks and design guidelines have been formulated that address these questions by articulating some notion of successful or desired AI. Further, approaches such as participatory design, value-sensitive design, and goal-oriented requirements engineering aim to connect system development processes with high-level contextual concerns and non-functional softgoals. However, to establish the effectiveness of these instruments for informing AI for well-being solutions, it is necessary to have normative analysis and evaluation frameworks that recognize the innate complexity and multidimensionality of human well-being. This paper presents Herman Dooyeweerd's philosophy as one such framework and provides a formulation of well-being informed by his Theory of Aspects and his “simultaneous realization of norms” principle. The paper then presents a multi-aspectual analysis of AI Ethics frameworks to illustrate and suggest a mechanism that can be employed across diverse contexts and domains for requirement analysis and requirements refinement for technology solutions in general, but specifically for AI for well-being solutions.},

The design of these tools addresses several issues: (1) support for a common language for the design process, deriving from state-space search, (2) visual interfaces for collaboration, (3) specifications for a class of games (called PRIME games) whose affordances represent a balance between simplicity and richness, (4) educating students to work in design teams that use advanced computational services, and (5) assessing the learning and contributions of each team member. We also report on a focus group study in which four undergraduate students used the tools.

  pages={974-981},
  abstract={Gender inequality is a widespread problem in our society. It can manifest itself in many ways and contexts, and starting as early as primary school. While an increasing number of initiatives aim at tackling gender biases and inequalities, few of them are aimed at raising awareness of gender (in)equalities among young children, i.e., at the age in which such inequalities appear in their lives. The potential shown by social robots in teaching non-curricular topics is a promising motivation for exploring their use in this context. Indeed, a social robot could offer children the possibility to discuss gender (in)equality with an intelligent entity that is neither male nor female, but rather a credible outsider with respect to mankind. In this article we present the design process of a social robot, named PixelBot, and associated robot-mediated storytelling activity aimed at raising awareness of gender (in)equality among children. We used a participatory design approach involving 20 children aged 10-13 to acquire (i) their opinion on how a robot should look like and (ii) stories featuring robots and gender (in)equality. Finally, we conducted a study involving 8 children aged 9-10 to test the co-designed robot and robot-based storytelling activity. Results suggest that social robots are a promising avenue to promote gender equality and respect in children.},

This paper discusses what needs to be considered by both policy makers and ‘managers’ in order to exploit the use of AI for SDG achievement. AI can act as a real and meaningful enabler to achieve sustainability goals; however, it may also have negative impacts. Therefore, a carefully balanced approach is required to ensure that Artificial Intelligence systems are employed to help solve sustainability issues without inadvertently affecting other goals.},

  abstract={This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML.},

  abstract={Scenario planning is useful to approach the uncertainty of the future but scenario planning in public policy has gained less attention while public policy requires more realistic future scenarios. This study aims to study what are the roles of scenario planning linking public policy with the future. This study adopted a methodology based on workshop discussion among experts using Korean AI policy case as a case study. The main roles of scenario planning for public policy were exhibited to consider the publicity to approach and resolve public issues, to define the multiple stakeholders and their interests during public policy decisions, to approach time mismatching issues, and to consider cross-border effect between private and public sectors by public policy. The cross-border effect between private and public sectors by technological innovation was uniquely discussed and the theory of scenario planning is extended including the public area in this study.},

  abstract={The benefits of user-centered and participatory design have been widely acknowledged for the development of technologies that are likely to be appropriated by the product&#x2019;s stakeholders. While participatory design has been applied to some affective technologies, the technical and algorithmic complexity of those based on semi-intelligent information filters (SIIFs) pose distinct challenges. Coincidentally, these technologies raise important and distinct ethical issues that make stakeholder input critical during product design. We present a framework for fostering genuine engagement from stakeholders through the case example of biomusic - a SIIF-based affective technology that translates emotion-related physiological changes into sound. During a 3-day workshop, ethnographic methods were used to collect data about the interface between biomusic and individuals on the autism spectrum. From these data, emergent themes, such as such as privacy, data security, conceptions of assistive technology and representation of emotions were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. In order to illuminate distinct design decisions implicated by these complex and interwoven ethical issues, we propose a design framework consisting of a technological, a human-centered and an ecological lens. This framework and recommendations provide a concrete praxis for engaging stakeholders in the complex issues associated with the design of SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems.},

  abstract={Scholars acknowledge that achieving societal impact should be a key aim of research. However, societal impact usually becomes tangible only long after research completion, so that scholars can hardly report its evidence in a research article, if it is to be published in a timely manner. Interventionist research methods that involve engagement with stakeholders to generate solutions for real-world problem situations can provide a path towards direct societal impact. We argue that achieving such impact requires effective engagement with careful attention to the timing of engagement and inclusiveness of stakeholders – drawing on examples from our own research projects. Our analyses suggest that the research team needs to make choices to structure engagement efforts across research phases spanning problem definition, solution design, and solution evaluation. These choices define a space of possibilities that a research team can navigate based on considerations of access, research setting, research approach, and researcher expertise. We map these to three specific interventionist research approaches: Action Research, Clinical Research, and Action Design Research to highlight the alternatives. The paper concludes by pointing out that interventionist approaches can create favorable conditions but require the judicious exercise of choices by the research team to generate outcomes with direct societal impact.},

In this paper, we discuss the barriers to successful adoption of AI4EO in developing countries and propose a roadmap for more impactful applications of future AI4EO research. The recommendations emerge from three case studies that illustrate the need to create AI4EO systems that take into account technical, social, and ethical considerations specific to the Global South such as data and infrastructural limitations, gaps in technological literacy, geodiversity issues in remote sensing (RS) datasets, and the need for stronger stakeholder engagement, among others. Finally, we propose a framework based on more inclusive, human-centered methodologies rooted in the needs, perspectives, and lived experiences of domain experts, decision-makers, and local communities in the Global South.},

Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse. The goal of our project is to create a mobile phone application that can detect digital dating abuse. To create the user-interface of this application, we are using a participatory design process. This paper describes the first two phases of this process. Focus group sessions were conducted to understand user requirements and generate hand drawn images to get users' visions of the application. Themes generated using thematic analysis concluded that the users wanted an application with an educational component, supported by a detection tool and a resource locator. A digital mockup of the phone app, with the themes generated and images drawn out by the participants, was then created.},

  abstract={In today's world, characterized by the massive generation of data, a major problem related to data manipulation occurs when people's privacy is violated. To face this situation different regulations and solutions, to help users get in control over their data, emerged. However, many of the solutions require a certain level of knowledge in the field of privacy or offer unclear information that does not facilitate a real control of their data by the users. Added to this is the unfriendly user interface design as one of the factors that prevents users from managing their privacy settings effectively. Thus, in this work we explore the effect of the application of Participatory Design (PD) techniques in the implementation of privacy enhancing technologies. In particular, we focus on the use of PD for the design of a privacy dashboard that encourages the immersion of users with privacy issues and gives them greater control with a user interface according to usability criteria. The evaluation of the PD process, which has resulted in a high-fidelity prototype of the dashboard, shows encouraging results and greater user immersion in privacy management.},

  abstract={Over the past couple of years, implementations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly risen in numerous platforms, tools and applications around the world, impacting a broad range of industries such as manufacturing towards Smart Factories and Industry 4.0, in general. Nevertheless, despite industrial AI being the driving force for smart factories, there is strong reluctance in its adoption by manufacturers due to the lack of transparency of the black-box AI models and trust behind the decisions taken, as well as the awareness of where and how it should be incorporated in their processes and products. This paper introduces the Explainable AI platform of XMANAI which takes advantage of the latest AI advancements and technological breakthroughs in Explainable AI (XAI) in order to build "glass box" AI models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop" without the decrease of AI performance. The core of the platform consists of a catalogue of hybrid and graph AI models which are built, fine-tuned and validated either as baseline AI models that will be reusable to address any manufacturing problem or trained AI models that have been fine-tuned for solving concrete manufacturing problems in a trustful manner through value-based explanations that are easily and effectively interpreted by humans.},

  abstract={For varying reasons, our world is experiencing increasing life expectancies and decreasing birth rates, which has led to a generational shift in population distribution. The Government of Canada predicts that in the year 2030, over 9.5 million (23%) Canadians will be 65 years or older. For this growing demographic of older adults, intelligent home health technologies have been proposed as one beneficial avenue to support and maintain an individual’s health and wellness as they begin experiencing aging-related health effects. However, many ethical concerns have been raised regarding the design and deployment of intelligent home healthcare technologies in aging- in-place settings such as long-term care and nursing homes. This paper presents a revised participatory design methodology to identify aging-in-place stakeholders’ ethical concerns with two Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) devices. The main objective of this paper is to develop and test a participatory design research method that is well suited for older adults living in long-term care settings, which is currently lacking. Developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers and social science researchers, this paper presents the participatory method that was designed and tested in a long-term care facility by collaborating with a mix of aging-in-place stakeholders, including older adults and healthcare professionals. By interweaving interactive activities, hand-written tasks, and discussions throughout the data collection process, the methodology successfully identified stakeholders’ ethical concerns with the devices.},

These groups are located in different areas, and have different knowledge. They are restricted and affected each other. The way and the evaluation criteria that they consider the development of the products and their knowledge field are different. At the same time, there are dependable relations between the design object and the attribute. Therefore, it is inevitable that there are conflicts in the process of coordination design. These conflicts play an important role in the process, on the one hand the existence of conflicts will result in coordination or breakdown, on the other hand, the conflict will bring a better or a brand-new design, with the solution to a series of conflicts, a better project will be designed. So it has great and positive significance to study the method to solve the conflict of collaborative design.},

  abstract={Object detection remains an active area of research in the field of computer vision, and considerable advances and successes has been achieved in this area through the design of deep convolutional neural networks for tackling object detection. Despite these successes, one of the biggest challenges to widespread deployment of such object detection networks on edge and mobile scenarios is the high computational and memory requirements. As such, there has been growing research interest in the design of efficient deep neural network architectures catered for edge and mobile usage. In this study, we introduce YOLO Nano, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of object detection. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create YOLO Nano, where principled network design prototyping, based on design principles from the YOLO family of single-shot object detection network architectures, is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create a compact network with highly customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task of embedded object detection. The proposed YOLO Nano possesses a model size of ~4.0MB (>15.1× and >8.3× smaller than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) and requires 4.57B operations for inference (>34% and ~17% lower than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) while still achieving an mAP of ~69.1% on the VOC 2007 dataset (~12% and ~10.7% higher than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively). Experiments on inference speed and power efficiency on a Jetson AGX Xavier embedded module at different power budgets further demonstrate the efficacy of YOLO Nano for embedded scenarios.},

  abstract={Over the years, the number of firms measuring and reporting environmental, social, and governance data has seen a massive shift due to the overwhelming demand and pressure from different stakeholders. The introduction of various international regulatory bodies like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), has also been intentional in encouraging companies to disclose publicly documents like annual reports, integrated reports in regards to topics like social, environmental, employee affairs and human rights. When it comes to investing, ESG issues take into account a firm’s operational influence on the native environment. Customers, policy makers, investors, and regulators are exerting huge amount of pressure on Companies to carry out Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") reporting also known as non-financial reporting. Sustainability reporting has previously exhibited numerous advantages to businesses as accurate data collection and reporting are essential for managing the company’s sustainability performance as well as improving financial decision making. It is vital for a company’s long-term performance to actively disclose and communicate its non-financial practices and approaches. Therefore, in order to answer questions like; “Is it vital for developing market firms to disclose non-financial information, such as that relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG)?”, this paper will attempt to provide a deeper insight into ESG disclosure and the impact it has on Firm Performance using Machine Learning techniques (Regression) and performance Ratios (Return On Assets & Return On Equity).},

  abstract={Assistive technologies that incorporate affective computing methods may be useful for increasing inclusion across the autism spectrum. The involvement of this target population during development and design is key to ensuring that the technology is beneficial and has the potential to be adopted. This article reports on a participatory design process used for the development of an affective technology intended for users on the autism spectrum. We first briefly recapitulate concepts and theories about emotions to illuminate emotion-specific challenges faced in the design process. We then introduce biomusic, an affective technology that communicates emotional states by translating physiological signals into auditory output. The necessity of stakeholder involvement during the development of biomusic is discussed, with a focus specifically on including individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC). Finally, we present a concrete example of a participatory sound design workshop focusing on the development of biomusic's auditory display in collaboration with adolescents with ASC. From this experience, challenges of using participatory design for the development of affective technologies with people with ASC are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence - AI intervention in business has become pervasive across industries, making it invariably essential for human leadership to adapt. AI which might simulate human cognitive behaviour is likely to supplant human leadership. AI may thus redefine the role of leadership in organizations as AI progressively performs new intellectual tasks by replacing human intelligence. While, human limits of domain knowledge and experience restrict decision making, AI with its superior information processing abilities aims at overcoming cognition and complexity. Executives accept that AI will impact workforces as routine and logic based tasks become automated, leading to an increase in demand for EI skills. Even though AI is yet to replace skilled professionals, EI is what machines will remain deprived of. However forging of data, technology and emotional intelligence might be crucial to build an effective decision. HR professionals, policy and decision makers thus intend to leverage potential of AI technologies while seeking ways to offset the negative impacts of AI systems. The study proposes that in this era of technological leap, unprecedented disruption and ambiguous change; effective leadership needs to be redefined. Thus if, business functional domains seek any competitive advantage from AI, they would essentially need it to be coupled with EI.},

  abstract={IEEE Project 7010 Well-being Metrics for Autonomous and intelligent Systems is a standard for measuring the impact of artificial intelligence or autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) on humans. The overall intent of IEEE P7010 is to supports the outcome of A/IS having positive impacts on human well-being. It is the tenth of a series of standards in the P70xx series, all of which emerged from the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. The standard is grounded in scientifically valid well-being indices currently in use and based on a stakeholder engagement process. The intent of the standard is to guide product development, identify areas for improvement, manage risks, assess performance and identify intended and unintended users, uses and impacts on human well-being of A/IS products, services, and systems.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a multi-agent system to manage the distributed collaborative design environment. The JADE-based autonomous workflow management system (JAWMS) uses a workflow enactment mechanism and an agent integration mechanism. The workflow enactment mechanism is the system kernel and follows the specifications of the workflow reference model. The system kernel supports five agents to manage the workflow and the integration mechanism supports an agent to interact with other platforms and to coordinate and monitor the workflow. JAWMS facilitates integrated circuit design and team interaction in a collaborative but distributed product development environment.},

  abstract={The differences between CAD systems in data structures, result in the difficulty of synchronized collaborative design upon heterogeneous CAD systems. A data exchange method based on cellular ontology model (COML) is presented. Using COML as a medium, communication between heterogeneous CAD systems is achieved. COML which is a product data model of the highest abstract layer, implements uniform representation of different knowledge of CAD feature models and real-time semantics exchange. The test results show that the proposed approach is available and effective.},

  pages={10a-10a},
  abstract={The central idea in reference modeling is the reutilization of the business knowledge contained in reference models for the construction of specific information models. The orientation on the technical content of a reference model can increase the efficiency of processes in business engineering projects. Despite this, the use of reference models in the field of business engineering has not established itself in practice. This is due to the particular field of conflict between research and practice, in which reference modeling is at home. Thus, there is still a deficit in knowledge about the use and problems inherent in the implementation of reference models despite the array of theoretical concepts. Accordingly, in the past years the supply-sided development of reference models predominant in the science world has distanced itself from their demand-sided use in business and administration. The article at hand analyses this problem and presents an integrative approach to the computer-aided management of reference models. The task to be mastered using the proposed approach will be conceptually concretized with an framework and prototypically implemented in the form of a reference model management system.},
