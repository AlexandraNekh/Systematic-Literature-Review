  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.},

  abstract={VR painting has become increasingly popular for its potential to provide a less restricted painting environment. However, limited sensory feedback in existing VR painting systems detracts people from fully immersive experience. To better integrate multisensory interaction into the VR painting system, we invited 12 participants to a participatory design process. Based on participants' feedback, we envision the design of a smart VR painting system, which integrates visual, audio, haptic, and smell feedback to enhance immersion. Meanwhile, AI's capability is adopted to reduce the difficulty of painting in VR.},

  year={2011},

  number={},
  pages={225-232},
  abstract={In this paper we describe the challenges involved in automating collaborative negotiations and propose solution idea that can reduce computational cost of deal identification. We consider negotiations over a matter that has multiple issues and each issue can take any one of the multiple possible values for that issue. Two challenges are discussed in detail. The first one is the difficulty of assigning utility value ( i.e. evaluating) each possible contract in large contract spaces. The second is the computational complexity of locating the optimal contract. Previous work proposed grouping contracts to avoid evaluating each contract and a mediated bidding based deal identification algorithm to reduce the search for the optimal contract. However, the computational cost of exhaustively matching bids from agents grows exponentially with the number of agents and bids. We propose a rule that can be used during grouping of contracts (defining constraints) that reduces the number of possible bids from agents and hence increases the number of agents that could participate in the negotiation. We assume that each constraint corresponds to one evaluation criterion. The rule states that when evaluating contracts by a criterion, only contracts that satisfied previous contracts are considered.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are having a great impact on all aspects of society. However, due to the technical competencies and mathematical understanding required for implementing solutions leveraging these technologies, access to the communities working on these technologies is limited to those having these skills. This limits the ability of domain experts to directly transfer their knowledge and contribute to the development of AI and ML systems. To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) are popular topics of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and are more and more applied in factory operations. This paper provides a vision of how Quality Management is evolving towards a Quality 4.0 (Q4.0) approach. Although the term Q4.0 was introduced with the fourth industrial revolution, its use and understanding are still unclear and not widespread. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis on the topic has been carried out followed by a more general overview of literature on the impact of digitalization on Quality Management. The literature findings along with the empirical experience of the authors led to the development of a comprehensive framework depicting the challenges of different nature faced during the adoption of a Q4.0 approach from the initial awareness of the topic, till the implementation phase. After its empirical validation, the framework can be used as a basis to develop an implementation framework of Q4.0.},

  abstract={In this paper, we first discuss the necessity of a support system for distributed multi-lingual development teams, to bridge the gaps between different languages, cultures and social systems of a client and a vendor when defining a requirement specification of an application system. Next, we propose the design of an agent-based support system for defining requirement specifications, consisting of collaborating design assistant agents, common design support functions and a language translation web service. To implement the approach we plan to use OMAS, a platform for developing multi-agent systems. OMAS has features for describing multi-lingual ontologies and multi-lingual representations of dialogs. It also provides a platform for testing multi-cultural cooperation over the Internet. Some experimental applications are being developed currently using different natural languages. In this paper, we propose an agent-based support system for requirement specification definition as one such application. The proposed system is a web-based and agent-based application and supports a multi-lingual software design team using a network of personal design assistant agents.},

Indeed, organized research groups usually have steering committees supporting their actions, and making decisions implementing the group's strategy. A big picture that reveals a network of topics, exposing how the community reacts to changes (trends, discoveries, social impacts, etc) is critical for making good decisions. We believe that a collaborative approach for building a CSCWD ontology will help keeping track of CSCWD themes and allow developing more consensual and effective initiatives.

  abstract={This paper presents observations from engineering ontology design sessions. We followed the entire design process of a group of engineers building an ontology for root cause analysis to be applied to petroleum pump failure diagnosis. The group was composed of experts with same background, who work in different locations of the same company. Even though they apparently share similar analysis methods, during meetings discrepancies emerged. Different points of view were argued and decisions were made at the end of each meeting. Given the final product acceptance problems, we look back at each meeting and attempt to identify the reasons that led to this unfortunate and common outcome. Understanding the problem enables us to draw a set of guidelines for empowering design meetings with simple technologic methods for improving group final artifact acceptance; therefore diminishing re-work. Our observations point towards (1) a correlation between designers' behavior and future artifact acceptance; (2) a set of actions that interrupts or brings back group attention; and (3) a metric for evaluating group design meetings. We believe our findings may guide software developers to tools for supporting group design.},

Case-based reasoning system can provide the most similar cases for the new product development project to shorten the time-to-market of new product. However, most of the CBRS are limited to the cases created within the company. It would be very difficult to access information about collaborative partners before the collaborating project started. Therefore, sharing of product cases between collaborating partners becomes a research issue. This paper makes sharing of design cases between partners become easier by utilizing the ontology alignment technology to integrate the case-based reasoning systems of the collaborating partners.

  abstract={Indefinite semantic conflict of words is another category of the problem of semantic consistency of words, besides definite semantic conflict of words. While the definite cases are well solved in our previous work, there are still no effective solutions to the indefinite semantic conflicts of words, which involve a much more complicated process of semantic discrimination. Based on WordNet and our ontology description language FLoDL, we propose a document type based word frequency accumulation algorithm to solve the problems. This algorithm is carried out in two phases based on different document types: a training phase and a discrimination phase. The discrimination phase is mainly based on the words' frequency information collected in the training process. Finally, through some detailed experiments, a compared analysis is given to show that our algorithm has a far better performance than other previous solutions, thus improves the overall performance collaborative editing},

We propose an awareness ontology that conceptualizes the most important aspects of awareness in such systems and can be used to automatize the development of their user interfaces.

  abstract={While projects, developments and applications addressing and using artificial intelligence (AI) are rather multifaceted and their number is constantly increasing, the standardisation activities in the field of artificial intelligence are limited, their number is significantly lower and does not increase at the same pace. The European funded project StandICT.eu aims at supporting European experts' presence in and contributions to international standardisation activities in ICT. The focus of the project is on the 5 priority domains identified by the European Commission (Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data, Cyber Security, 5G) and on Artificial Intelligence while being open for other relevant topics defined in the annual European Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation. The project has two main outcomes: (i) increased contribution of European experts in international standardisation through support by providing grants for planned contributions of successful applications of experts, and (ii) an online observatory of published standards and ongoing standardisation activities in the areas mentioned before. This observatory (called Standards Watch) is accessible through the project's web site and open for contributions and comments from registered users. As part of the effort for the Standards Watch the projects has prepared a comprehensive analysis of the international standardisation landscape in the AI field, that comprises a description of the ICT standards and ongoing work at international level in the field of AI across the standardisation organisations already active in the field. In this article we will present results of our work where we have analysed the work of the 5 international and European Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) IEEE,11Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [13]. ISO/IEC,22International Organization for Standardization [15]/International Electrotechnical Com mission [12]. ITU-T,33International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector [16]. ETSI44European Telecommunications Standards Institute [10]. and CEN-CENELEC55European Committee for Standardization [7]-European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization [8]. developing standards in the field of AI. The first 4 bodies have already been active several years in AI standardisation at the time of writing this article. CEN-CENELEC has launched a focus group in 2019 which aims at producing a roadmap for AI standardisation. For these 4 SDOs information on their active groups, details of their work and the respective state/outcome is provided in the main part of this article. Followed by the same exercise for the two identified Standards Settings Organisations (SSOs): W3C66World Wide Web Consortium [20]. and IRTF,77Internet Research Task Force [14]. their active groups and the respective state/outcome. With this information an initial analysis of the AI standardisation landscape as Q3 2019 is performed with the main outcomes that (i) the number of working groups chaired by Europeans is significant and (ii) that there is room for European experts contributing to ongoing and future standardisation work. The article is concluded by considerations on future priorities.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) leverages distributed and non-dedicated sensing concepts by utilizing sensors embedded in a large number of mobile smart devices. However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume resources from any number of participants’ devices; as well as attempting to clog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection devices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a machine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore, the aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect to misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach where the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection performance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher performance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100% detection accuracy using small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel architecture for collaborative multi-agent functional modeling in design on the semantic Web. The proposed architecture is composed of two visiting levels, i.e., local level and global level. The local level is an ontology-based functional modeling framework, which uses Web ontology language (OWL) to build a domain-specific local functional design ontology repository. Using this local ontology repository, the requests coming from the functional design agent can be parsed and performed effectively. The global level is a distributed multi-agent collaborative virtual environment, in which, OWL is used as a content language within the standard FIPA agent communication language (FIPA ACL) messages for describing ontologies, enabling diverse functional design ontologies between different agents to be communicated freely. The proposed architecture facilitates the exchange between diverse knowledge representation schemes in different functional modeling environments, and supports computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) between multiple functional design agents},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={With the increasing complexity of engineering design objects, online collaborative design is considered to be a way to solve complex design problems by using multidisciplinary teams and parallel work. However, the coexistence of collaboration and competition among interdisciplinary teams, the coexistence of the consistency of the overall design goals and the heterogeneity of individual knowledge, causes frequent conflicts in the design process. The traditional integrated conflict resolution strategy adopts the corresponding conflict resolution strategy to solve the conflicts in order based on the conflict classification. Essentially, conflict resolution is regarded as a static resolution process, which is a repetitive work of "detecting conflicts and resolving conflicts". This article defines the concept of conflict degree by integrating the three dimensions of conflict subject contradiction degree, conflict object complexity and conflict problem impact degree, and links conflict with the collaborative design process, and regards the conflict process as a dynamic development process with the design process. On this basis, for conflicts with a high degree of conflict, the strategy of direct activation assisted negotiation is adopted to shorten the conflict resolution cycle and improve the quality of conflict resolution. Based on the modeling and calculation method of conflict degree, the negotiation process is explained.},

  pages={99-108},
  abstract={Ontologies that explicitly identify objects, properties, and relationships in specific domains are essential for collaborations that involve sharing of data, knowledge, or resources among autonomous individuals. Against this background, this paper motivates the need for collaborative environments for ontology construction, sharing, and usage; identifies the desiderata of such environments; and proposes package based description logics (P-DL) that extend classic description logic (DL) based ontology languages to support modularity and (selective) knowledge hiding. In P-DL, each ontology consists of packages (or modules) with well-defined interfaces. Each package encapsulates a closely related set of terms and relations between terms. Together, these terms and relations represent the ontological commitments about a small, coherent part of the universe of discourse. Packages can be hierarchically nested, thereby imposing an organizational structure on the ontology. Package-based ontologies also allow creators of packages to exert control over the visibility of each term or relation within the package thereby allowing the selective sharing (or conversely, hiding) of ontological commitments captured by a package.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1295-1300},
  abstract={Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a challenging problem with important real-world applications. Recent efforts attempting to exploit powerful representations by deep neural networks (DNN) are hindered by the lack of subjectively annotated data. This paper presents a novel BIQA method which overcomes this fundamental obstacle. Specifically, we design a pair of collaborative autoencoders (COAE) consisting of a content autoencoder (CAE) and a distortion autoencoder (DAE) that work together to extract content and distortion representations, which are shown to be highly descriptive of image quality. While the CAE follows a standard codec procedure, we introduce the CAE-encoded feature as an extra input to the DAE's decoder for reconstructing distorted images, thus effectively forcing DAE's encoder to extract distortion representations. The self-supervised learning framework allows the COAE including two feature extractors to be trained by almost unlimited amount of data, thus leaving limited samples with annotations to finetune a BIQA model. We will show that the proposed BIQA method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has superior generalization capability over other learning based models.

  abstract={Ignoring the designers' belief in the collaborative design process will lead to imperfect characterization of design information, and affect information sharing of collaborative designs, thus make the design inefficient. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a belief representation method of designing a mental model based on Design Rationale. First, through the logic narration of designers, on the basis of the DR model, the knowledge semantic network is constructed based on the Bayesian Network. Then, the causality in the Bayesian Network is obtained by means of node conversion. Finally, the belief in designing mental models is calculated by reusing the design rationality for parameter learning. An example of cantilever beam structure design is used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Motivated by mitigating potentially harmful impacts of technologies, the AI community has formulated and accepted mathematical definitions for certain pillars of accountability: e.g. privacy, fairness, and model transparency. Yet, we argue this is fundamentally misguided because these definitions are imperfect, siloed constructions of the human values they hope to proxy, while giving the guise that those values are sufficiently embedded in our technologies. Under popularized methods, tensions arise when practitioners attempt to achieve each pillar of fairness, privacy, and transparency in isolation or simultaneously. In this position paper, we push for redirection. We argue that the AI community needs to consider all the consequences of choosing certain formulations of these pillars-not just the technical incompatibilities, but also the effects within the context of deployment. We point towards sociotechnical research for frameworks for the latter, but push for broader efforts into implementing these in practice.},

More and more countries legislate for publicly-issued companies to provide such information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to exploit stakeholder information for constructing stake-based social networks. We devise three types of networks: StakeNet (a company-person network), StakeCompanyNet (a company-company network), and StakePersonNet (a person-person network). We also present a visualization tool to display socio-centric and ego-centric views of the networks. Furthermore, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of the StakeNet, and the results reveal that most of StakeNet's characteristics are similar to those of a typical social network, excluding that the in-degree does not follow a power law distribution. Finally, we show two applications of StakeNet by utilizing it to discover influential companies and business groups. The experiments suggest that our outcomes are highly consistent with the results generated by human experts.},

  abstract={To achieve the minimal latency, proactive wireless communication has been proposed to facilitate proactive mobile networks. Due to lacking closed-loop control, random selection of radio resource units (RRUs) serves the only way to the critical radio resource allocation (RRA), which inevitably suffers collisions of simultaneous utilizing the same RRUs to result in loss of packets, particularly in the uplink. Macroscopic view on the uplink and downlink network operation cycle insightfully suggests that it is still possible to construct a delayed version of semi-closed-loop operation to predictively utilize radio resource in the uplink of proactive mobile network. A two-stage reinforcement learning mechanism to enable the recommendation of radio resource utilization from network infrastructure to mobile smart machines is proposed, which consists of the multi-armed bandit scheme for RRA and the neural network to learn historical utilization of RRUs. Simulations verify machine learning enables smart and predictive RRA with superior performance that can lead to the minimal latency of mobile networking.},

Researchers have developed XR-based simulators for various surgical fields such as laparoscopic surgery, brain surgery, and eye surgery, among others. However, there is a lack of effort in developing a holistic framework to support the creation of such XR-based simulators. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the need for a framework by integration of various elements such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), participatory design, information modeling, and computational approaches to support the creation of XR-based simulators. A detailed survey of the current state of the art for the development of XR-based simulators is presented in this paper followed by the gap in the current research. The need for a framework based on the current gap is also showcased in the paper.

  abstract={Plenteous research has been undertaken on the direct effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on smart decision-making. However, little attention has been paid to contextual factors such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart governance that mediate the relationship between AI and smart decision-making. This research investigates direct, mediating, and parallel-sequential multiple mediating interactions between AI, the IoT, smart governance, and smart decision-making. We used a self-structured survey to collect cross-sectional data from citizens in the Republic of Korea, and 516 responses were examined using SmartPLS structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). A parallel-sequential multiple mediator framework is assessed using the Hayes Process Model with bootstrapping. Our results reveal a substantial and favorable multi-mediating effect from the IoT and smart governance on the relationship between AI applications and smart decision-making, as predicted. Previous scholars have investigated a few factors that influence decision-making, but our research contributes to the literature of applied and social sciences, including traditional decision theory, by examining the impact of multi-mediating factors on smart decision-making. This study presents both theoretical and practical implications for scholars and policymakers engaged in the development of smart cities. Additionally, this study provides recommendations for future research.},

In this work, we reflect on the design of visualizations for explaining novel approaches to clustering complex anatomical data from head and neck cancer patients. These visualizations were developed, through participatory design, for clinical audiences during a multi-year collaboration with radiation oncologists and statisticians.

  abstract={In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to explore high-performance folded-waveguide (FWG) slow-wave structures (SWSs) for broadband application in traveling-wave tubes (TWTs). DRL combines deep learning (DL) for perception and reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making to form a complete automated system from input data to output action control. The deep  ${Q}$ -network (DQN), a typical model of DRL is employed to learn how to design FWG SWSs like human beings, and to apply the learned design experience to meet different application requirements. To verify the effectiveness of this method concretely, a DQN is trained in  ${G}$ -band to explore the general design policy of FWG SWSs for realizing broadband beam-wave interaction, and it will be exploited to search for well-structured FWG SWSs in the frequency band centered at 850 GHz. Using CST to predict the performance of the structure designed by the DQN, the simulation results show that the reflection coefficient  ${S}_{{11}}$  is less than −20.3 dB and the transmission loss is less than 1.95 dB/mm from 750 to 1000 GHz. With a pencil electron beam of 20 kV and 10 mA, the hot simulation results show that the 3-dB bandwidth with the output power greater than 1.6 W and the gain greater than 26 dB can reach 110 GHz from 800 to 910 GHz. Such a design method will facilitate researchers to obtain a practical FWG structure at specified operating conditions, and help to get a deeper insight into the design process from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI).},

For achieving a solution to a certain global problem, each agent has its own local goal to be fulfilled. When working on a shared goal each agent would like its priorities to be given the most consideration. Unfortunately, many agents' priorities (arising from their own personal goals) will not be coherent with their fellow agents', thus leading to the conflict problem. This paper presents a formal and executable approach to resolve conflict in multi-agent systems by negotiation and arbitrage. We give the definition of agent, action, environment, negotiation process in formalization. Negotiation and arbitrage strategies of conflict resolution are also presented.

Agent technology is an innovative and promising approach to implementing distributed systems and is becoming popular in various areas of computing in recent years. In this paper, the dynamic nature of collaborative design process and the representation of collaborative design knowledge are presented. In order to model constantly evolving design process and the rationales resulted from collaboration, a Collaborative Product Data Model (CPDM), which extends traditional Product Data Model (PDM), and a constraint-based Collaborative Design Process Model (CDPM) are proposed. These are intended to facilitate the management and coordination of collaborative product design process and knowledge management. A design example is used to illustrate CDPM. While the system is being implemented, the architecture of our agent-based collaborative product design environment based on CPDM and CDPM is described.},

  abstract={Due to the demographic changes, the demand for care services adapted to the elderly will have an unprecedented growth globally. In this situation, maintaining quality of life (QoL) and wellbeing for older adults will need support of complementary, nontraditional, ICT-based care practices. vINCI project, part of the European research effort in this domain, aims to deliver an integrated technology for the monitoring and instrumentation of the QoL intervention for older adults. The process of designing the vINCI application is based on the patient profile model that will be the input to provide personalized healthcare. The profile is used as evidence to evaluate the impact of vINCI solution on the perceived quality of life provided by caregivers. This paper proposes a complementary approach in modelling the user profile by identifying the needs and preferences of elderly and translating them into development requirements of the vINCI monitoring platform. In this respect, this paper proposes a methodology and methods to define user needs, which are based upon the User Centered Design principles, such as user surveys. The needs survey provides information that is used to specify the needed functional and nonfunctional requirements that vINCI platform must support.},

  abstract={In CSCW and related fields, computer supported collaborative design has been used in various fields. Yet, there has been little research focusing on the collaborative context design for elderly caring. For filling this gap, this paper explores a notion of rule-driven layout co-designing system for elderly caring. What makes it distinct from other layout designing system is that it employs hierarchically modularization to store all standardized components that are needed for the aging caring space, and embeds intelligence algorithm into the typical evidence-based design for improving design efficiency and reducing design costs. In this paper, we designed and implemented a prototype called iCare Designer, and conducted a preliminary study to understand how this notion works in reality. While findings of the preliminary study suggest promises of the notion of rule-driven space layout co-designing system, it reveals some challenges this kind of systems to truly work in practices, mainly reflecting in its flexibility and perception to ambient environment.

  abstract={Serious games show to have positive impact on training results. Advantages of simulation games lay in the provision of a safe training environment, where users are able to play, test and probe without serious consequences. At the same time, it is important to engage learners by providing a motivating, challenging environment, which becomes meaningful to the player when skills and knowledge acquired within the game are transferrable to real work tasks. With the use of a participatory game design approach, we developed an immersive, meaningful virtual training environment to improve situational awareness skills. Feedback of game developers as well as from test groups shows that the participatory approach to game development lead to a meaningful experience within an authentic virtual training environment. High functional and physical fidelity, a high degree of realism, compared with challenging game elements makes the developed serious game an appropriate training tool for situational awareness skills.},

Yet, there is a comparative lack of discourse across the design discipline regarding this topic. While there are fragments of methodological readiness for designing (with/for) AI, the nuances of such need to be further explored. The aim of this article is to shed light on these and suggest a possible way forward for design that can ensure AI-powered artifacts remain safe even as their utility evolves over time.},

This paper describes how the SIMPATICO project has used HI to contribute towards a further democratisation of e-services, i.e. making easier for citizens to complete the web-based services offered by public administrations (PAs). The Open Government solution proposed has been deployed and evaluated in three European pilots. This paper reflects on the results obtained applying the SIMPATICO solution to one of those PAs, i.e. regional government of Galicia in Spain. This reflection should help illustrating the ample potential of applying HI to give place to smarter more accessible humanfacing services.},

  abstract={Each passing day seems to bring new instances of automation of routine tasks and the addition of artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms to new domains. Autonomous systems are a diverse class of technologies ranging from AI driven natural language processing and image recognition to closed-form control systems for aircraft autopiloting. Coincident with this explosion in autonomy is a related drumbeat of stories of AI failures. These failures have ranged from tragedies resulting in bystander deaths to humorous examples of video game flaws being exploited. Widespread deployment and use of autonomous systems will depend on society trusting that these systems will perform as expected. While bias from incomplete training data is a well-trod area for improvement toward reducing AI failures, it is unclear if this bias is a sufficient or merely a necessary condition for loss of trust. What else may be needed for public assurance in autonomous systems? Here we identify three features of diverse autonomous systems that serve as a foundation for assured autonomy. These features are: the accuracy with which the algorithm senses and perceives the environment in a manner relatable to humans; a reduction in bias driven by the training data and algorithmic bias; and the complexity of the algorithmic process in terms of the ability to reverse engineer the decision-making processes. Building from this foundation, future autonomous systems can begin to reverse the loss of trust starting to be seen with respect to these technologies.},

Within the Computing Education Community, only a minority of research reports have experience teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI), and very little research has been conducted on teaching and learning AI in Africa. Given the high importance and impact of AI, this is alarming. Learning and teaching AI in an African higher education setting provides unique challenges compared to the standardized approach in the Global North. Our undergraduate course in AI was carried out in a novel way that emphasized the creative application of AI to meet the requirements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).

As AI becomes more pervasive and integrated into various domains, there is a growing need for AI governance models that can ensure that the development and deployment of AI systems align with ethical, legal, and social standards. There are some answers that literature puts forward to the question onthe way the government and public administration has to react to the huge concerns related to AI and usage of policies to avoid the emerging challenges. In this survey, AI problems and the prior AI regulation techniques are analyzed. In this research study, a governance model for AI is proposed by combining all the facets and also implements a new procedure for governing AI. This study will help the decision makers to make smart government a reality by using AI governance framework.},

  volume={24},
  number={1},
  pages={371-381},
  abstract={PhenoLines is a visual analysis tool for the interpretation of disease subtypes, derived from the application of topic models to clinical data. Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert. These results suggest that PhenoLines demonstrates promising approaches to support the characterization and optimization of topic models.},

  pages={70242-70260},
  abstract={The modern world is evolving rapidly, especially with respect to the development and proliferation of increasingly intelligent, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-related technologies. Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today's technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a “Human-or-AI” conversation about task assignments to more contextualized “Human-and-AI” way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.},

  abstract={In 2019, the IEEE launched the P7000 standards projects intended to address ethical issues in the design of autonomous and intelligent systems. This move came amidst a growing public concern over the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence (AI), compounded by the lack of an anticipatory process for attending to ethical impact within professional practice. However, the difficulty in moving from principles to practice presents a significant challenge to the implementation of ethical guidelines. Herein, we describe two complementary frameworks for integrating ethical analysis into engineering practice to help address this challenge. We then provide the outcomes of an ethical analysis informed by these frameworks, conducted within the specific context of Internet-delivered therapy in digital mental health. We hope both the frameworks and analysis can provide tools and insights, not only for the context of digital healthcare but also for data-enabled and intelligent technology development more broadly.},

  abstract={The use of semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) to support emergency response scenarios, such as fire surveillance and search-and-rescue, has the potential for huge societal benefits. Onboard sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) allow these UAVs to operate autonomously in the environment. However, human intelligence and domain expertise are crucial in planning and guiding UAVs to accomplish the mission. Therefore, humans and multiple UAVs need to collaborate as a team to conduct a time-critical mission successfully. We propose a meta-model to describe interactions among the human operators and the autonomous swarm of UAVs. The meta-model also provides a language to describe the roles of UAVs and humans and the autonomous decisions. We complement the meta-model with a template of requirements elicitation questions to derive models for specific missions. We also identify common scenarios where humans should collaborate with UAVs to augment the autonomy of the UAVs. We introduce the meta-model and the requirements elicitation process with examples drawn from a search-and-rescue mission in which multiple UAVs collaborate with humans to respond to the emergency. We then apply it to a second scenario in which UAVs support first responders in fighting a structural fire. Our results show that the meta-model and the template of questions support the modeling of the human-on-the-loop human interactions for these complex missions, suggesting that it is a useful tool for modeling the human-on-the-loop interactions for multi-UAVs missions.},

  pages={2754-2761},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has an increasing impact on all areas of people's livelihoods. A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.},

The challenges are magnified on current CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we study the problem of GPU launch bound configuration in hybrid graph algorithms. We train a multi-objective deep neural network to learn a function that maps input graph characteristics and runtime program behavior to a set of launch bound parameters. When applying launch bounds predicted by our neural network in BFS and SSSP algorithms, we observe as much as 2.76× speedup on certain graph instances and an overall speedup of 1.31 and 1.61, respectively. Similar improvements are seen in energy efficiency of the applications, with an average reduction of 14% in peak power consumption across 20 real-world input graphs. Evaluation of the neural network shows that it is robust and generalizable and yields close to a 90% accuracy on cross-validation.},

  pages={47-52},
  abstract={Effort estimation is essential for successful software project planning, budgeting, and risk identification. However, the techniques used to estimate effort are often inaccurate, outdated, and only consider technical factors while neglecting project management or stakeholder engagement. Expert estimation remains an important technique for leveraging human expertise in software estimation, but solely relying on this technique causes biased and subjective predictions. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shifted the direction of software project effort estimation towards computational intelligence. Nonetheless, there is a lack of deployment due to ambiguous outcomes and ineffective model-building approaches. This study presents an ensemble-based framework that can estimate software project effort more accurately with the incorporation of domain knowledge and experiences. To achieve this, six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be constructed using six distinct classifiers on the proposed USP05-FT dataset. The collected expert estimations will be integrated into the proposed dataset as an additional feature in the form of numerical values such as expert-provided software project effort estimations (in person hours) that provide additional insight and knowledge. Subsequently, the predictions of all six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be combined through majority voting to obtain a more accurate and reliable prediction with increased robustness against errors and uncertainties. The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using Recall, F-measure, Precision, and Accuracy. It is expected that the proposed ensemble-based framework for software project effort estimation will lead to more efficient and effective software project management, an improvement in resource allocation, empowering informed decision-making, and timely project delivery.},

Perhaps thanks to high-resolution visualization and recognition, wearable displays, mobile robots and drones, completely new services such as telepresence and extended reality will be possible. The main issue of the studies is the transfer of data with a rate of up to 1 Tbit/s per user. This may become possible thanks to the efficient use of the spectrum in the THz domain. Another important issue will be using and implementing smart technologies, different type data sources, artificial intelligence and remote (tele-) presence that raise many technical and mathematical problems on the road toward 6G. For these reasons, 6G networks are a huge area for research. This article presents the possible services and involved technologies of the 6G network and its possible features. The following are system-wide trends that will define goals for 6G. In conclusion, a key way-points and research program are suggested.},

  abstract={Division of labor is a widely studied subject of collective behavior in natural systems. It is concerned with the question of how the regulation of the division of labor may contribute to the performance of the multi-agent system. This brief investigates the evolution of the division of labor with three strategies by employing the evolutionary game theory. Thus, these available strategies are provided for the unstructured multi-agent system: strategy A (performing task A), strategy B (performing task B), and strategy C (not performing any task but only interfere other's actions). Depending on the parameter settings in the payoff matrix, four specific scenarios occur and the corresponding stability of the equilibrium points there are provided by calculation. Numerical calculation results are also provided for an intuitive description of the strategy evolution state. Results show that larger synergistic benefit contributes to the effective division of labor in the system, providing high benefits for the multi-agent system. These results help design a effective mechanism where self-organized division of labor occurs in the form of maximizing the benefit of the multi-agent system.},

  abstract={Business Process Management (BPM) has gained remarkable importance in research and practice in the last years. Innovative information and communication technology (ICT) is a driver for the effectiveness and efficiency of enterprise collaboration and the management of inter-organizational business processes. In this context, cooperating enterprises need a shared understanding of their own processes, those of their partners as well as of emerging inter-organizational process structures. In order to create such a shared understanding, the concept of collaborative modeling can serve as a useful approach. This article introduces a concept for collaborative business process modeling and its implementation in the CoMoMod tool. The tool supports several aspects of collaborative process modeling, such as simultaneous work of spatially distributed modelers on one process model diagram. Furthermore the tool permits synchronously creating a collaborative model with different modeling languages by automatically mapping and converting the different model representations. The proof of concept utilizes Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and Petri Nets. The usage of an integrated chat messaging service supports communication during the process of collaboratively modeling business process.},

  pages={152-159},
  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to explore the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots as part of public services, mainly when applied to mental health in today’s post-pandemic world. The adoption of AI chatbots to keep up with basic customer support business activities is based on extensive knowledge, both from the hard (software development) and the soft side (increasing the added value to the service/product). However, using chatbots as extenders of public services to support mental health in pandemic times is an emerging research topic. Hence, the paper identifies niche and under-explored research gaps in state-of-the-art literature, thus contributing to the body of academic knowledge. The paper adopts a design science approach to formulate the problem statement, articulate the objectives of target solutions, and propose a design and development framework for future mental health chatbots by employing an extensive literature review. Findings from this paper emphasize considerations of ethical issues and governance, purposeful and goal-oriented design, and AI-based technology as critical enablers for designing new mental health chatbots. The paper contributes to the knowledge by providing clear and structured future research priorities and offers a framework for designing more effective and intelligent mental health chatbots that public organizations and managers may find useful.},

Information is power and there are several challenges to conduct a successful and appropriate interaction between machines and humans to obtain and interpret the corresponding data. This study presents a summary of the new trends and types of equipment that are used in Artificial Intelligence Systems to support the urban planning process in the new cognitive cities paradigm were the human factor is the key. Based on the aforementioned, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology has been applied, originated by the searching for knowledge of social and technical situations about HCI. The results, which have been derived from data analysis, illustrate the impact of HCI in the digital age. Furthermore, they demonstrate some tendencies and approaches of the HCI research as well as artifacts and applications of HCI, and its relevance in the planning of cognitive cities.},

  title={Identifying AI Opportunities in Donor Kidney Acceptance: Incremental Hierarchical Systems Engineering Approach}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={The current organ placement process for transplantation is an evolving system of systems with emergent behavior. This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders’ needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor “reducing kidney discard” and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons. Future work will include developing data-driven models for all stakeholders using current data incorporating the most recent kidney allocation policy changes.},

  pages={230-235},
  abstract={There is a struggle in Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics to gain ground in actionable methods and models to be utilized by practitioners while developing and implementing ethically sound AI systems. AI ethics is a vague concept without a consensus of definition or theoretical grounding and bearing little connection to practice. Practice involving primarily technical tasks like software development is not aptly equipped to process and decide upon ethical considerations. Efforts to create tools and guidelines to help people working with AI development have been concentrating almost solely on the technical aspects of AI. A few exceptions do apply, such as the ECCOIA method for creating ethically aligned AI -systems. ECCOIA has proven results in terms of increased ethical considerations in AI systems development. Yet, it is a novel innovation, and room for development still exists. This study aims to extend ECCOIA with a deployment model to drive the adoption of ECCOIA, as any method - no matter how good -is of no value without adoption and use. The model includes simple metrics to facilitate the communication of ethical gaps or outcomes of ethical AI development. It offers the opportunity to assess any AI system at any given life-cycle phase, e.g., opening possibilities like analyzing the ethicality of an AI system under acquisition.},

  abstract={Sand models as used in military are thematic 3D representations of an area of interest which combined the information of maps with a more realistic 3D bird's eye view of the terrain. Sand models have been used for military planning and war gaming for many years as a field expedient, small-scale map, for planning and training of military operations. This, however increasingly fell out of favor with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. The proposed system, a Digital Sand Model (DSM) using a Virtual Reality (VR) Workbench, is a digital replica of the same. It involves a leader interacting with the digital environment and other viewers share his view of the digital scene. The system uses a stereoscopic projector, a mirror and Viewing Screen setup to produce a 3D stereoscopic display. This VR system allows performing interactive 3D explorations via stereo camera setup and wearable IR LEDs. A gesture recognition system is also described which allows interaction with the system. The proposed system uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture as the software design.},

  abstract={With the introduction of new technologies such as cloud computing and big data, the security issues of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) have become more complicated. Meanwhile, a lot of current security research lacks adaptation to industrial system upgrades. In this paper, an edge-cloud synergy framework for security decision-making is proposed, which takes advantage of the huge convenience and advantages brought by cloud computing and edge computing, and can make security decisions on a global perspective. Under this framework, a combination of Bayesian network-based risk assessment and stochastic game model-based security decision-making is proposed to generate an optimal defense strategy to minimize system losses. This method trains models in the clouds and infers at the edge computing nodes to achieve rapid defense strategy generation. Finally, a case study on the hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform proves the feasibility of the approach.},

  abstract={Research in robotics and human-robot interaction is becoming more and more mature. Additionally, more affordable social robots are being released commercially. Thus, industry is currently demanding ideas for viable commercial applications to situate social robots in public spaces and enhance customers experience. However, present literature in human-robot interaction does not provide a clear set of guidelines and a methodology to (i) identify commercial applications for robotic platforms able to position the users’ needs at the centre of the discussion and (ii) ensure the creation of a positive user experience. With this paper we propose to fill this gap by providing a methodology for the design of robotic applications including these desired features, suitable for integration by researchers, industry, business and government organisations. As we will show in this paper, we successfully employed this methodology for an exploratory field study involving the trial implementation of a commercially available, social humanoid robot at an airport.},

  abstract={Aiming at the complex structure and weak real-time performance of traditional visual tracking system, a scheme based on PYNQ (Python productivity for Zynq) framework is designed and deployed in Zynq heterogeneous platform. Firstly, according to the real-time requirements, the kernel-related filter tracking algorithm is selected. Then, according to the characteristics of the Zynq computing platform, the software and hardware collaborative design method is used to divide the system tasks, and the algorithm is converted into RTL (Register Transfer Level) by HLS (High Level Synthesis) development tools, and the calculation is performed. The process is optimized and exported as an IP core. Then, Python is used to import the IP core as a hardware coprocessor at the top level to implement the underlying to top-level data interaction. Finally, the system result is asynchronously updated in the Jupyter notebook. Experiments show that the system has good real-time performance, and the tracking speed averages 27.9FPS. At the same time, it has superior execution efficiency, is easy to develop and transplant, and has certain engineering reference value.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an approach to generate offers and counter-offers in a bilateral negotiation process between cognitive agents with the learning machine capacities. The approach is configured, as each participant of a negotiation process improve their satisfaction degree, gaining knowledge from prior experience, i.e., in the next negotiation session, each participant can individually use this knowledge to redefine the configuration parameters of strategies and tactics to generate offers and counter-offers. Each agent refines their strategies using a genetic algorithm application based on the historical offers and counter-offer exchanges dataset. This context can lead to a new dimension in CSCW system development. This approach was tested in a simulated bilateral negotiation environment, which involved, for example, a buyer agent and a seller agent. The discussions about the results confront different negotiation sessions comparing agents provided with strategy and tactics reconfiguration capabilities and agents using static strategies and tactics.},

  pages={137063-137082},
  abstract={A growing number of oil and gas offshore infrastructures across the globe are approaching the end of their operational life. It is a major challenge for the industry to plan and make a decision on the decommissioning as the processes are resource exhaustive. Whether a facility is completely removed, partially removed or left in-situ, each option will affect individual parties differently. Stakeholders’ concerns and needs are collected and analyzed to obtain the most compromised decommissioning decision. Engaging with hundreds of stakeholders is extremely complicated, hence time-consuming and costly. This issue can be addressed using a predictive model to provide suggested decommissioning options based on the data of previously approved projects. However, the lack of readily available relevant datasets is the main hindrance of such an approach. In this paper, we introduce a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset extensively covering all types of offshore infrastructures in the UK landscape over a 21-year period. An experimental framework using several learning algorithms on the new dataset for predicting the decommissioning option is presented. Various resampling methods were applied to tackle the imbalanced class distribution of the dataset for improved classification. Promising results were achieved despite the exclusion of some stakeholder-related features used in the traditional approach. This shows signs of a potential solution for the industry to significantly reduce time and cost spent on a decommissioning project, and encourages more efforts put into researching on this timely topic.},

  abstract={Research in fast-evolving technologies like AI & ML requires the collaborative effort of various stakeholders including industries and universities. In developed economies, industry-university collaboration (IUC) is mature and delivers benefits to both stakeholders. In a developing nation like India, there is relatively less emphasis on IUC and when present, is restricted to a small set of premier institutions. At the undergraduate level, the collaboration between industry and university is very minimal to none. This poses major challenges to industry (insufficient qualified talent pool, higher cost of training fresh recruits, limited choice of external research partners) as well as universities (curriculum lagging latest technology, not reaching full research and innovation potential, source for research funding). This paper summarizes the IUC effort undertaken by Intel Technology India Ltd and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at PES University to create mutually rewarding outcomes for both partners and describes a new model encompassing technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship in addition to the traditional elements of IUC. We present the IUC considerations and processes adopted to deal with the challenges and share the outcomes and impact at the end of two years of engagement and hope that key aspects of this IUC can be leveraged by other industry and university stakeholders for mutually rewarding outcomes.},

  year={2022},
  volume={52},
  number={5},
  pages={907-917},
  abstract={When robotic systems are developed for individualized training during rehabilitation, providing effective feedback to the users is essential. We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time. We conclude with a set of guidelines for developing automated feedback for patient populations.},

  pages={1091-1104},
  abstract={A physical unclonable function (PUF) is a hardware security primitive, which can be used secure various hardware-based applications. As a type of PUFs, strong PUFs have a large number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs), which can be used for authentication. At present, most strong PUF structures follow a one-to-one input/output relationship, i.e., linear function. As such, strong PUF designs are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) based modeling attacks. To address the issue, a dynamically configurable PUF structure is proposed in this article. A mathematical model of the proposed dynamic PUF is presented and the design is proposed against the effective ML based attacks, such as deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression (LR) and reliability-based covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES). Experimental results on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) show that the proposed dynamic structure has achived good uniqueness and reliability. It is also shown that the dynamic PUF has a strong resistance to the CMA-ES attack. Due to the dynamic nature of the proposed PUF structure, an authentication protocol is also designed to generate recognizable authentication bits string. The protocol shows strong resistance to classical machine learning attacks including the new variant of CMA-ES.},

There has been a shift towards increased reliance on distributed sensors to monitor bidirectional power flows and machine learning based load forecasting methods (e.g., using deep learning). These methods are fairly accurate under normal circumstances, but become highly vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks that could be deployed on the load forecasters. This paper provides a novel model-based Testbed for Simulation-based Evaluation of Resilience (TeSER) that enables evaluating deep learning based load forecasters against stealthy adversarial attacks. The testbed leverages three existing technologies, viz. DeepForge: for designing neural networks and machine learning pipelines, GridLAB-D: for electric grid distribution system simulation, and WebGME: for creating web-based collaborative metamodeling environments. The testbed architecture is described, and a case study to demonstrate its capabilities for evaluating load forecasters is provided.},

  year={2015},
  volume={},

  pages={83-91},
  abstract={Civil engineering projects increasingly involve a wide range of stakeholders with diverse interests and multidisciplinary teams. Engineers need soft skills to deal with these teams and stakeholders. “How to educate these soft skills to engineering students?” is the central question for technical universities. The course Collaborative Design and Engineering in the Dutch master's programme Construction Management and Engineering is an answer to that question. Feedback, however, indicated that the course did not meet expectations. The course needed a radical redesign. This paper describes the redesign and resulting framework of the course. The principles of the redesign are constructive alignment, activated learning and not to lecture the skills as `dry stuff'. The resulting course is based on a `pressure cooker - coaching' framework. The pressure cooker part creates a situation in which the students will experience stress. The students work in large groups on a complex assignment under time pressure. A mix of group and individual assignments creates tension between students. The coaching part provides structure and guidance. Theory on the necessary soft skills is introduced early in the course in workshops. Consultation meetings help to keep the students on track. The course has now evolved over three years. Theoretical evaluation shows that the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework fulfills the requirements of constructive alignment. Practical evaluation, using feedback, shows a consistent high score. We consider the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework broadly applicable and is successful enough to continue in our CDE course. Elements of the course can be improved. We consider introducing more theoretical depth and psychology without violating our idea of `no dry stuff' and `action learning'.},

  abstract={Several decision-aid frameworks attempt to provide an optimal solution to the complex, challenging problem of delivering water supply and sanitation services to communities in need. However, a failure in proper needs assessment or handoff causes systemic failure of an installed system. Capacity factors analysis (CFA) is one such framework that focuses on personalized technology-specific alternative recommendations; and it faces similar challenges. While helpful in many ways, designers using CFA still make critical assumptions with regards to community's expressed needs and only passively include the community members in the design process. Appreciative inquiry (AI) is introduced as a means to bridge this gap and increase community empowerment. The AI approach is a four-phase process: discovery, dream, design, and destiny. The process starts with asking community members about their strengths and capabilities, follows with their vision of the community, creates a space for collaborative design, and ends with implementation. A service-learning experience in Tshapasha is provided to demonstrate AI's benefits. The results are compared to a CFA-focused study of Tshapasha from 2011.},

The following article describes the results of an empirical study assessing the contribution of an interactive InfoVis method based on a spring metaphor (GRAVI), exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) to ease understanding. The application domain is the psychotherapeutic treatment of anorectic young women. The three methods are supposed to support the therapists in finding the variables which influence success or failure of the therapy. To conduct the evaluation we developed a report system which helped subjects to formulate and document in a self-directed manner the insights they gained when using the three methods. The results indicate that the three methods are complementary and should be used in conjunction.},

  abstract={COVID-19 has forced the government to close educational institutes to reduce the spread of the virus. As a result of this decision, students lose contact with teachers and a communication gap also arises. This survey attempts to bridge the gap between students and teachers. Through this survey, we sought to understand where the students are lacking and what are the different steps that can be taken by the teacher to improve the performance of the student and whether this concept should be reviewed or not. We found that most of the researchers who have published papers that we have read did the same mistake in their research, therefore we realized that the concept of AI should be studied again, and we should try not to repeat the same mistake in our research.The main aim of our project is to build “Teacher facing dashboard” which can help the teacher to summarize,visualize and analyze the data of the education field(academics) and also understanding the students performance using Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning (DL).},

  abstract={The deployment method of cloud computing is commonly used for artificial intelligence algorithm in current power inspection technology. For the outstanding problems such as huge energy consumption, low efficiency and poor timeliness of cloud computing, this paper proposes a low-energy power inspection scheme based on “cloud-fog-edge” collaborative technology. The portable AI diagnostic device at the edge side and the fixed UAV library at the fog side are developed respectively, and the method of two-level traffic offloading and cooperative diagnosis is adopted to sink the AI computing power to the edge side and reduce the pressure of 5G base stations and central servers, so as to achieve the global optimization of system energy consumption and the accurate identification of power equipment defects. To complete an inspection task in cloud computing mode, the system consumes 22,000~32,000 KW·h; to complete an inspection task in cloud edge collaboration mode, the system consumes 12,000~18,000 KW·h at the highest, reducing 16.93%~63.10%; to complete an inspection task in cloud fog edge collaboration mode, the system consumes 7,400~11,000 KW·h, reducing 48.8~77.25%, while the timeliness, accuracy, data security, system stability and inspection efficiency of identification have been greatly improved.},

With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, the company has carried out the technical transformation, innovation, and upgrading of the No. L Oilfield to meet the change of comprehensive informatization, comprehensively upgraded the engineering design software, eliminated the original two-dimensional design, and fully adopted BIM design. The company relies on the building information model to meet the architectural design tasks in the existing oil region. The BIM model contains much more information than the 2D CAD plane, including complete information such as equipment name, structure type, construction process, cost, human resources, machinery, etc., which makes the architectural design tasks completed through BIM software more information-based and intelligent, so as better to serve the future oilfield industry upgrading and construction. Although the current BIM-related design and software are still new and have many shortcomings, with the development of technology and the continuous improvement of software, the building information model will play a decisive role in the future intelligent information age for oil field construction.},

  abstract={GUI (graphical user interface) prototyping is a widely-used technique in requirements engineering for gathering and refining requirements, reducing development risks and increasing stakeholder engagement. However, GUI prototyping can be a time-consuming and costly process. In recent years, deep learning models such as Stable Diffusion have emerged as a powerful text-to-image tool capable of generating detailed images based on text prompts. In this paper, we propose UI-Diffuser, an approach that leverages Stable Diffusion to generate mobile UIs through simple textual descriptions and UI components. Preliminary results show that UI-Diffuser provides an efficient and cost-effective way to generate mobile GUI designs while reducing the need for extensive prototyping efforts. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the speed and efficiency of GUI prototyping in requirements engineering.},

Recent advances in IoT have made it possible to develop real-time improved traveler assistance tools for mobile phones, which we describe in this paper. These tools will be particularly valuable for the elderly or disabled travelers, or people with other constraints that require assistance, but will be highly valuable also to the seasoned traveler. The tool covers the essential path through the airport onto the flight, but also allows the traveler to fill their waiting time by discovering the facilities of the airport, aided by a recommender system using machine-learning. At the same time the system provides the airport with anonymized user "heat maps" which can highlight congestion and other aggregated data to highlight situations that require intervention, such as emergencies. Initially targeting Android, the app makes use of the fog-to-cloud platform developed by the Horizon2020-funded mF2C project.},

  number={9},
  pages={1256-1268},
  abstract={As a lightweight hardware security primitive, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can provide reliable identity authentication for devices of Internet of Things (IoTs) with limited resources. However, the delay-based PUF structures in authentication protocols have static responding behaviors, which make them vulnerable to modeling attacks. To address this issue, many complex PUF designs have been designed to increase the nonlinearity of their models. However, most of them can still be broken by modeling-based machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a dynamic responding mechanism for PUF designs to generate dynamic responses is proposed. Different from the concept of logically reconfigurable PUFs, the proposed mechanism does not rely on external inputs to provide reconfiguration signals. And different from the conventional PUF authentication protocols that use large-size linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to extend the master challenge, the proposed scheme uses internally generated dynamic signals to obfuscate the master challenge to generate multiple subchallenges. These subchallenges are then input to the underlying strong PUF to generate multibit dynamic responses. It can prevent an attacker from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs) for the underlying PUF. A security authentication protocol is also proposed, the special authentication bit-string design can resist both conventional ML attacks and the latest covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES) variant.},

  abstract={Airports are one relevant environment in the smart cities implementation. Recent progresses in IoT have made it possible to develop advanced real-time services and assistance tools for travelers, making use of fog computing as an architectural model that places itself between the Cloud and the IoT, in the Cloud-to-Things Continuum, fulfilling requirements for strict real-time responses. The main tool exploits the concept of proximity marketing and covers the essential experience through the airport onto the flight, but also allows travelers to spend their waiting time by discovering the facilities of the airport, supported by a recommendation system using machine learning. The system provides also the airport planners an aggregated and anonymized view, like heat maps, of travelers behavior that highlight bottlenecks in the infrastructure, or highlight situations that require intervention, such as emergencies. The app in based on Android and makes use of the fog-to-cloud platform developed by the Horizon2020-funded mF2C project, giving evidence that the adoption of the fog-to-cloud approach brings significant benefits in terms of performance and optimization of resource usage, giving an objective evidence of the impact of the mF2C framework.},

  pages={392-400},
  abstract={The security in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks becomes increasingly important with the growing popularity of IoT devices and their wide applications (e.g., critical infrastructure monitoring). However, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not suitable for IoT networks due to their large resource requirements. Moreover, IoT networks tend to have multiple access points for IoT devices and thus benefit from a distributed framework to enable collaborative prevention of potential attacks. To this end, we propose a lightweight collaborative distributed network IDS (NIDS) based on widely-utilized machine learning (ML) models, which are trained through a federated learning framework with two known datasets. We evaluate the distributed NIDS using the trained ML models on an IoT network testbed under seven types of attacks in comparison with Snort (a state-of-the-art IDS) and a centralized implementation of our proposed NIDS. An offline benchmark is also designed to measure the system’s performance with regard to resource usage and response time. Our results show that the proposed distributed NIDS outperforms Snort in identifying malicious traffic and achieves a much lower false positive rate compared to the centralized version in real-time for all seven types of network attacks tested.},
