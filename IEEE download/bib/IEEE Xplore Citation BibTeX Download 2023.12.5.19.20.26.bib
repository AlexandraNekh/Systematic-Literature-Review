  abstract={This article describes the story of pragmatism and its transformation into symbolic interactionism at Carnegie Mellon University and Aalto University. In both universities, design researchers were interested in user experience in interactive systems. John Dewey's pragmatism taught them to study how experience sometimes transforms into an experience and occasionally into stories. Herbert Blumer's interactionism had its roots in Chicago School sociology, and it developed in association with pragmatism. His interactionism gave these researchers tools to study Dewey's concepts empirically. We show in the article how this theoretical connection came about after 2000 and how it has shaped research programs in these two communities since then. We also discuss the relevance of pragmatism and interactionism in our current technological landscape, dominated by social media and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={In the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy by design and privacy impact assessments are given an even more prominent role than before. It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems. Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied. This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them. Our results show that both agile and services make the end-toend analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions. Additionally, we open a new research avenue pointing to Amazon Macie as an example of Machine Learning applications that aim to provide a solution to the scalability and usability of Privacy Threat Modeling processes.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) is a promising paradigm that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet, Internet of People, and many Internet-based paradigms to transform the industry, society, and people lives. It provides seamless integration of intelligent devices – with sensing, identification, processing, communication, networking capabilities, Big Data (machine learning, analytics, and distributed computing), and human sensors (collaboration, intelligent cognition, and social networks). IoE brings excellent opportunities to improve changes in society with collaborative intelligent systems. However, these new technologies also bring significant challenges and do not address major existing issues, including interoperability, reliability, and intelligence management. Awareness of these issues is required before IoE applications can be widely deployed. This work introduces an observatory for cataloging IoE applications. Registering these applications will support researchers, developers, and users to exchange more information, design improved IoE applications, facilitating the composition of different enablers (human and non-humans). The main contributions of this work include the proposal of a technology platform, the IoE Database (IoEDB), that enables the distributed and collaborative cataloging of IoE initiatives and provides the evolution of a ‘live’ IoE knowledge-based taxonomy to support interoperability and awareness of IoE enablers.},

  title={Composition of Resource-Service Chain Based on Evolutionary Algorithm in Distributed Cloud Manufacturing Systems}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={19911-19920},
  abstract={In distributed cloud manufacturing (CMfg) systems, multi-resource service can complete more complex manufacturing tasks than single resource service. Especially in business process, all the resource services are invoked in a certain sequence, which is called the Resource-Service Chain (RSC). The RSC, as a sequential composition of resource services, expresses the scheduling and the flow of servicing to a distributed business process. A perfect composition can improve utilization ratio and efficient matching availability of resource services greatly. However, most of the existing methods for resource service composition paid no attention to the temporal relationship between resource services. Moreover, the methods strongly depend on relevant element to be considered. Inspired by biological evolution, a Resource-Service Chain Composition Evolutionary (RSCCE) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, RSCCE tries to find multiple optimal solutions, namely all RSCs in a workflow with given constraints. To begin, initial sets of composite resource service are resolved by calculating the degree of dependency between resource services, so as to obtain initial RSCs by workflow. Then, RSCCE algorithm applies genetic algorithm to search for the extended of each initial RSC, a longer chain composing of it, to improve the reuse of RSC. Under this approach, gene and chromosome represent resource service and the entire RSC respectively. If the propagated chromosomes violate the sequence of resource service, as constraint in RSCCE algorithm, they will be repaired to obtain a valid solution. Finally, we take a multi-enterprise collaborative business process as an example to simulate our approach. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.},

  title={Identifying the Components and Interrelationships of Smart Cities in Indonesia: Supporting Policymaking via Fuzzy Cognitive Systems}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={46136-46151},
  abstract={Multiple Indonesian cities currently aim to qualify as “smart cities.” Previous research on defining smart cities (e.g., the implementation-oriented maturity model) tends to focus on components over interrelationships, is challenging to apply to a specific context such as Indonesia, and offers limited support for policy-relevant questions. In this paper, we propose to address these shortcomings to support policymakers in identifying concrete action plans in Indonesia specifically. Our approach clarifies interrelationships for the context of use and supports structural (e.g., what aspects of a “smart city” are impacted by an intervention?) as well as what-if policy questions. We started with a systems' science approach to developing a cognitive map of the components and their interrelationships, as is increasingly done in participatory modeling and particularly in socio-ecological management. We transformed semi-structured interviews of 10 Indonesian experts into maps and assembled them to create the first comprehensive smart cities cognitive map for Indonesia, totaling 52 concepts and 98 relationships. While a cognitive map already provides support for decision-making (e.g., by identifying loops in the system), it is only conceptual and thus cannot form predictions. Consequently, we extended our cognitive map into a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), whose inference abilities allow to examine the dynamic response of an indicator (e.g., “smart city”) in response to different interventions. As fuzzy cognitive maps include the strengths of interrelationships but not the notion of time, future research may refine our model using system dynamics. This refinement would support policymakers in investigating when to conduct and/or evaluate an intervention.},

  volume={6},

  pages={52355-52365},
  abstract={Nonhealing wounds pose a major challenge in clinical medicine. Typical chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, have brought substantial difficulties to millions of patients around the world. The management of chronic wound care remains challenging in terms of precise wound size measurement, comprehensive wound assessment, timely wound healing monitoring, and efficient wound case management. Despite the rapid progress of digital health technologies in recent years, practical smart wound care management systems are yet to be developed. One of the main difficulties is in-depth communication and interaction with nurses and doctors throughout the complex wound care process. This paper presents a systematic approach for the user-centered design and development of a new smart mobile system for the management of chronic wound care that manages the nurse's task flow and meets the requirements for the care of different types of wounds in both clinic and hospital wards. The system evaluation and satisfaction review was carried out with a group of ten nurses from various clinical departments after using the system for over one month. The survey results demonstrated high effectiveness and usability of the smart mobile system for chronic wound care management, in contrast to the traditional pen-and-paper approach, in busy clinical contexts.},

  abstract={In an effort towards the democratization of Robotics, this article presents a novel End-User Development framework called Robot Interfaces From Zero Experience (RIZE). The framework provides a set of useful software tools for the creation of robot-oriented software architectures and programming interfaces, as well as the modeling and execution of robot behaviors, with a specific emphasis on social behaviors. Programming interfaces built on top of RIZE enable professionals with different backgrounds and interests to design, adapt, and scale-up robotics applications. As an example of a programming interface, we present Open RIZE, which exploits an End-User Programming paradigm combining blocks, tables, and forms-filling interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, robot behavioral code generated by Open RIZE is intrinsically modular, re-usable, scalable, neutral to the employed programming language, and platform-agnostic. In the article, we present the main design guidelines and features of Open RIZE. Additionally, we perform an initial usability evaluation of the Open RIZE interface in an online workshop. Preliminary results using the System Usability Scale with 10 novice end-users indicate that Open RIZE is easy-to-use and learn.},

  abstract={A smart contract, in form, is represented as a piece of computer program code involving related commercial transactions and algorithms. Essentially, this is the computerization of the pre-agreed contract between the participants. This special contract agreement is automatically verified and executed once preset conditions are triggered. Smart contracts are not only used in the field of financial transactions, but also include many aspects of social life. Although smart contract technology has unique advantages, it is still in the early stages of development, and many problems remain to be solved. First, this article briefly summarizes the development process of blockchain, and then focuses on the research progress of blockchain 2.0-smart contracts. Second, the related concepts of smart contracts are presented, and the working mechanism of smart contracts and the difficulties faced by smart contracts are elaborated. Finally, in response to these problems and dilemmas, the corresponding solutions and ideas are summarized, and the future challenges and development trends of smart contracts are analyzed and judged.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={117486-117495},
  abstract={Automatic object removal with obstructed façades completion in the urban environment is essential for many applications such as scene restoration, environmental impact assessment, and urban mapping. However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background façade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and façade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building façades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.},

  title={Low Cost Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator Based on Bi-Directional Filtering and Bit-Width Reduction}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={14734-14746},
  abstract={This paper presents a low-area and energy-efficient hardware accelerator for the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Based on the multiply-accumulate-based architecture, three design techniques are proposed to reduce the hardware cost of the convolutional computations. First, to reduce the computational cost of convolutions, an adaptive bit-width reduction combined with near-zero skipping is proposed based on differential input method (DIM). The DIM-based design technique can reduce 62.5% of operation bit-width and improve 17.0% of activation sparsity with almost ignorable CNN accuracy degradation. Second, it has been found that adopting a bi-directional filtering window in a CNN accelerator can considerably reduce the energy for data movement with a much smaller number of memory accesses. To expedite the bi-directional filtering operations, we also propose a bi-directional first-input-first-output (bi-FIFO). With SRAM bit-cell layout manner, the proposed bi-FIFO facilitates fast data re-distribution with area and energy efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, the AlexNet accelerator has been designed. The numerical results show that the proposed adaptive bit-width reduction scheme achieves 34.6% and 58.2% of area and energy savings, respectively. The bi-FIFO-based accelerator also achieves 32.8% improved processing time.},

  abstract={Industrial design is a requisite and incontrovertible front-end design for Industrie 4.0 to realize personalization, agility, intelligence, and standardization, so it has very important practical significance to achieve industrial design collaborative workflow flexible management. This paper proposed a hierarchical colored Petri net (HCPN) for modeling the industrial design collaborative system workflow, which aims to provide a valid workflow model for the process management of the industrial design collaborative system. First, it is built the top-level workflow CPN model from product planning, markets research, product design, and product evaluation to prototype production, then the model is extended layer by layer to build the subnet model by the model refinement method. In the model, the activity of the workflow and the activity execution results are represented by the transitions ( $T$ ) and places ( $S$ ), respectively. The running state of the whole workflow is represented by the distribution of the token in the places. The token’ color sets expresses the real-time discrete state. By use of the function of token coloring places ( $S$ ) and the token’ color sets of HCPN, this paper extracts the common characteristics of process knowledge, including markets research results, design ideas, conceptual sketches, design schemes, human resources, and tacit creative knowledge, then uses the what, when, where, who, and how method to build knowledge information units for specific design event. Thus, realizes the industrial design process knowledge base construction and knowledge acquisition, which provides the necessary information and knowledge resources for the design reuse, flexibility management, and intelligent manufacturing of subsequent products.},

  abstract={Software development is incredibly complex. Specifically, open-source software (OSS) development requires developers to collaborate with each other to conduct their work. Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the OSS projects (e.g., bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, and so on) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on OSS projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: social network analysis, DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting overtime. DSNs over time are considered a small-world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55% diversity with 75% of evenness between the developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment. Moreover, DSNs over time have a few developers as core members and large developers as peripheral members. Finally, about 10% of developers changed their positions frequently over time.},

  abstract={The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the interest in new software tools to monitor the computer-based activities of employees working remotely (teleworking), and the demand for better analytics functionalities to be offered, focusing on employees’ performance and work-life balance. In this paper, we aim to analyze the habits of teleworking employees based on their interaction with the computer: how the employees are involved in different types of activities (actual work, recreation, documentation), and which are the most intensive periods. A conceptual framework for workforce analytics was developed for this purpose, together with tools and applications, that can provide useful information on different categories of activities where employees are involved. Knowledge generation is performed in four phases: collecting, processing, organizing, and analyzing the data to create valuable insights for the organization. Based on this framework, we developed a case study in an IT company, where two categories of employees, developers and software consultants, were monitored for 114 days, with 3.5 million events being generated and processed. The results showed different habits for consultants and developers, in terms of working activity structure, working schedule, inactivity time and interaction with the computer. Differences were also identified when we compared our results with previous research that monitored software developers working in-house: remote workers tend to organize their program for a longer period during the workday, and spend less time on meetings but longer time for programming. On the other hand, both categories of employees (in-house and teleworkers) show highly fragmented work, switching windows after very short periods of activity, with a potential negative impact on productivity, progress on tasks, and quality of output. The research results can be used in future employee productivity studies when searching answers to a fundamental question for workforce analytics – why are some employees more productive than others?},

  abstract={Human values (e.g., pleasure, privacy, and social justice) are what a person or a society considers important. Inability to address them in software-intensive systems can result in numerous undesired consequences (e.g., financial losses) for individuals and communities. Various solutions (e.g., methodologies, techniques) are developed to help “operationalize values in software”. The ultimate goal is to ensure building software (better) reflects and respects human values. In this survey, “operationalizing values” is referred to as the process of identifying human values and translating them to accessible and concrete concepts so that they can be implemented, validated, verified, and measured in software. This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle. However, the later phases (implementation and testing) and other aspects of software development (e.g., “team organization”) still need adequate consideration. We outline implications for research and practice and identify open issues and future research directions to advance this area.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={33661-33678},
  abstract={In today’s data-driven world, decision makers are facing many conflicting objectives. Since there is usually no solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously, the aim is to identify a solution with acceptable trade-offs. Interactive multiobjective optimization methods are iterative processes in which a human decision maker repeatedly provides one’s preferences to request computing new solutions and compares them. With these methods, the decision maker can learn about the problem and its limitations. However, advanced optimization software usually offer simple visualization tools that can be significantly improved. On the other hand, current approaches for multiobjective optimization from the visualization community provide superior visualization tools but lack advanced optimization. In this paper, we introduce a new term, interactivize, for integrating interactive multiobjective optimization and interactive visualization and present an interactivized approach supporting decision makers in visually steering interactive multiobjective optimization methods. We integrate state-of-the-art interactive visualization with the process of interactive multiobjective optimization in a visual analytics solution that significantly improves the analysis workflow of decision makers, like comparing selected solutions and specifying new preferences during the iterative solution process. To realize the new interactivized approach, we combine a coordinated multiple views system with DESDEO, an open-source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization. We demonstrate our interactivized approach on a river pollution problem.},

A family of experiments is a method of verification whereby we can check if the experimental results are reproducible. Through comparison with the updated control tool Creately, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the usability of the collaborative modeling chatbot and how it could be improved based on experimental evidence of changes in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction, and quality. A total of 87 students from three countries were recruited. We conducted a family of three experiments to compare the usability of SOCIO V1 and updated Creately in academic settings. Students appeared to be more satisfied with SOCIO V1, and SOCIO V1 scored better on completeness. There were no significant differences between the two tools regarding efficiency and quality. This study provides evidence on how to employ a family of experiments to improve chatbot usability and enrich knowledge on chatbot usability experimentation.},

Second, based on the theory of computational aesthetics, production rules were used to structurally describe the aesthetic knowledge of product form; the aesthetic index values of product form were calculated; and two gray-box image evaluation models of design features, aesthetic indexes, and images were established with the method of quadratic polynomial stepwise regression. Finally, using the image cognitions of users and designers as game participants and the two image evaluation models as profit functions, a noncooperative game model was established, and a quantum genetic algorithm was used to obtain the Nash equilibrium solution of the model to achieve the optimal design of the product form. Taking the optimal design of a sphygmomanometer as an example, the rationality and effectiveness of the method are verified.},

  abstract={This paper proposed an innovative method for aesthetic education by integrating shape grammar and neuroaesthetics. Aesthetic education can be divided into bottom-up aesthetic cultivation and top-down knowledge education, which correspond to the characteristics of shape grammar and neuroaesthetics, respectively. In this study, we redefined the state space of traditional shape grammar by replacing the computer-dominated label set with the affective-dominated emotion set of neuroaesthetics. This resulted in a neuroaesthetic shape grammar that is led by the designer and complementary to human intuition and algorithmic logic. We validated this method through practical design cases in the field of aesthetic education.},

  year={2006},
  volume={36},
  number={4},
  pages={563-577},
  abstract={Manufacturing process planning is the process of selecting and sequencing manufacturing processes such that they achieve one or more goals and satisfy a set of domain constraints. Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems. Major issues in these research areas are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are identified.},

  abstract={The boom in the capabilities and features of mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets, and wearables, combined with the ubiquitous and affordable Internet access and the advances in the areas of cooperative networking, computer vision, and mobile cloud computing transformed mobile augmented reality (MAR) from science fiction to a reality. Although mobile devices are more constrained computationalwise from traditional computers, they have a multitude of sensors that can be used to the development of more sophisticated MAR applications and can be assisted from remote servers for the execution of their intensive parts. In this paper, after introducing the reader to the basics of MAR, we present a categorization of the application fields together with some representative examples. Next, we introduce the reader to the user interface and experience in MAR applications and continue with the core system components of the MAR systems. After that, we discuss advances in tracking and registration, since their functionality is crucial to any MAR application and the network connectivity of the devices that run MAR applications together with its importance to the performance of the application. We continue with the importance of data management in MAR systems and the systems performance and sustainability, and before we conclude this survey, we present existing challenging problems.},

  abstract={Augmented Reality is a technique that enables users to interact with their physical environment through the overlay of digital information. While being researched for decades, more recently, Augmented Reality moved out of the research labs and into the field. While most of the applications are used sporadically and for one particular task only, current and future scenarios will provide a continuous and multi-purpose user experience. Therefore, in this paper, we present the concept of Pervasive Augmented Reality, aiming to provide such an experience by sensing the user's current context and adapting the AR system based on the changing requirements and constraints. We present a taxonomy for Pervasive Augmented Reality and context-aware Augmented Reality, which classifies context sources and context targets relevant for implementing such a context-aware, continuous Augmented Reality experience. We further summarize existing approaches that contribute towards Pervasive Augmented Reality. Based our taxonomy and survey, we identify challenges for future research directions in Pervasive Augmented Reality.},

  abstract={Microservices are a new trend rising fast from the enterprise world. Even though the design principles around microservices have been identified, it is difficult to have a clear view of existing research solutions for architecting microservices. In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology to identify, classify, and evaluate the current state of the art on architecting microservices from the following three perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption. More specifically, we systematically define a classification framework for categorizing the research on architecting microservices and we rigorously apply it to the 71 selected studies. We synthesize the obtained data and produce a clear overview of the state of the art. This gives a solid basis to plan for future research and applications of architecting microservices.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a new generation of secure information technology that is fueling business and industrial innovation. Many studies on key enabling technologies for resource organization and system operation of blockchain-secured smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 had been conducted. However, the progression and promotion of these blockchain applications have been fundamentally impeded by various issues in scalability, flexibility, and cybersecurity. This survey discusses how blockchain systems can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this regard, eight cybersecurity issues (CIs) are identified in manufacturing systems. Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature. Based on insights obtained from this analysis, future research directions for blockchain-secured smart manufacturing are presented, which potentially guides research on urgent cybersecurity concerns for achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0.},

There is enormous potential for us to use these data to understand ourselves better and make positive changes in our lives. Visualization (Vis) and visual analytics (VA) offer substantial opportunities to help individuals gain insights about themselves, their communities and their interests; however, designing tools to support data analysis in non-professional life brings a unique set of research and design challenges. We investigate the requirements and research directions required to take full advantage of Vis and VA in a personal context. We develop a taxonomy of design dimensions to provide a coherent vocabulary for discussing personal visualization and personal visual analytics. By identifying and exploring clusters in the design space, we discuss challenges and share perspectives on future research. This work brings together research that was previously scattered across disciplines. Our goal is to call research attention to this space and engage researchers to explore the enabling techniques and technology that will support people to better understand data relevant to their personal lives, interests, and needs.},

  year={2013},

  pages={92-104},
  abstract={Requirements elicitation research is reviewed using a framework categorising the relative `knowness' of requirements specification and Common Ground discourse theory. The main contribution of this survey is to review requirements elicitation from the perspective of this framework and propose a road map of research to tackle outstanding elicitation problems involving tacit knowledge. Elicitation techniques (interviews, scenarios, prototypes, etc.) are investigated, followed by representations, models and support tools. The survey results suggest that elicitation techniques appear to be relatively mature, although new areas of creative requirements are emerging. Representations and models are also well established although there is potential for more sophisticated modelling of domain knowledge. While model-checking tools continue to become more elaborate, more growth is apparent in NL tools such as text mining and IR which help to categorize and disambiguate requirements. Social collaboration support is a relatively new area that facilitates categorisation, prioritisation and matching collections of requirements for product line versions. A road map for future requirements elicitation research is proposed investigating the prospects for techniques, models and tools in green-field domains where few solutions exist, contrasted with brown-field domains where collections of requirements and products already exist. The paper concludes with remarks on the possibility of elicitation tackling the most difficult question of `unknown unknown' requirements.},

  abstract={Due to increased competitive pressure, modern organizations tend to rely on knowledge and its exploitation to sustain a long-term advantage. This calls for a precise understanding of knowledge management (KM) processes and, specifically, how knowledge is created, shared/transferred, acquired, stored/retrieved, and applied throughout an organizational system. However, since the beginning of the new millennium, such KM processes have been deeply affected and molded by the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, which involves the interconnectedness of machines and their ability to learn and share data autonomously. For this reason, the present article investigates the intellectual structure and trends of KM in Industry 4.0. Bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review are conducted on a total of 90 relevant articles. The results reveal six clusters of keywords, subsequently explored via a systematic literature review to identify potential stream of this emergent field and future research avenues capable of producing meaningful advances in managerial knowledge of Industry 4.0 and its consequences.},

  abstract={Since the early 20th century, inventors have conceptualized “plane cars” and other urban aerial transportation. Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) “flying car” concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics.},

  abstract={In recent years, the investigations on cyber-physical systems (CPS) have become increasingly popular in both academia and industry. A primary obstruction against the booming deployment of CPS applications lies in how to process and manage large amounts of generated data for decision making. To tackle this predicament, researchers advocate the idea of coupling edge computing, or edge-cloud computing into the design of CPS. However, this coupling process raises a diversity of challenges to the quality-of-services (QoS) of CPS applications. In this article, we present a survey on edge computing or edge-cloud computing assisted CPS designs from the QoS optimization perspective. We first discuss critical challenges in service latency, energy consumption, security, privacy, and reliability during the integration of CPS with edge computing or edge-cloud computing. Afterwards, we give an overview on the state-of-the-art works tackling different challenges for QoS optimization, and present a systematic classification during outlining literature for highlighting their similarities and differences. We finally summarize the experiences learned from surveyed works and envision future research directions on edge computing or edge-cloud computing assisted CPS optimization.},

  volume={8},

  pages={78779-78807},
  abstract={This paper presents a systematic review of relevant primary studies on the use of augmented reality (AR) to improve various skills of children and adolescents diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from years 2005 to 2018 inclusive in eight bibliographic databases. This systematic review attempts to address eleven specific research questions related to the learing skills, participants, AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, evaluation parameters, intervention outcomes, generalization, and maintenance. The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible. The review also proposes the research taxonomy for ASD. Future research addressing the effectiveness of AR among more participants, different technologies supporting AR for the intervention, generalization, and maintenance of learning skills, and the evaluation in the inslusive classroom environment and other settings is warranted.},

  pages={1175-1211},
  abstract={Network slicing has been widely agreed as a promising technique to accommodate diverse services for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.},

  abstract={Awareness is building on how managers should be involved in Industry 4.0 cybersecurity. This awareness and concern derives from heavy dependence of integrated information systems and technology for Industry 4.0. Manufacturing companies rely on data to run their operations. The Internet of Things is exponentially increasing the number of entry points for organizations to defend from nefarious actors. Complex digital value chains expose firms to risks beyond their direct control. The potential damage of cyberattacks is substantial in terms of continuity of business operations, theft of confidential information, and reputational harm. Even with this mounting sense of urgency, there is increasing confusion on what needs to be done and how. C-suite executives and entrepreneurs are puzzled due to the complexity of issues and concerns. Cybersecurity professionals, for their part, often fail to make the issue relevant and accessible to non-technical stakeholders. In this paper, we clarify why Industry 4.0 requires an evolving cybersecurity perspective. We identify where current approaches fall short and what emerging practices are gaining relevance. Our analysis is based on discussions with senior executives and an extensive literature review of academic papers and practical reports.},

  abstract={World leaders and scientists have been putting immense efforts into strengthening energy security and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by meeting growing energy demand for the last couple of decades. Their efforts accelerate the need for large-scale renewable energy resources (RER) integration into existing electricity grids. The intermittent nature of the dominant RER, e.g., solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems, poses operational and technical challenges in their effective integration by hampering network reliability and stability. This article reviews and discusses the challenges reported due to the grid integration of solar PV systems and relevant proposed solutions. Among various technical challenges, it reviews the non-dispatch-ability, power quality, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability related to solar PV systems grid integration. Also, it addresses relevant socio-economic, environmental, and electricity market challenges. Finally, it highlights the proposed solution methodologies, including grid codes, advanced control strategies, energy storage systems, and renewable energy policies to combat the discussed challenges. The findings of this article assist the power system scholars and researchers in conducting further research in this field. Furthermore, it helps the decision-makers to choose the appropriate technologies to deal with the anticipated challenges associated with the grid integration of PV systems.},

The focus of this paper is on rapid prototyping based on electron beam lithography as an alternative and complementary to what is available via deep-UV lithography-based foundries. We describe in detail the PDK and the use of open-source and commercial tools for the design of optical filters, sensors, neuromorphic photonic processors, optical switches, and discuss test and packaging approaches for these designs. We demonstrate that a “germanium less” process can be used to build small systems featuring photoconductive detectors, electronics, and phase shifters.},

  abstract={Cognitive radio technologies enable users to opportunistically access unused licensed spectrum and are viewed as a promising way to deal with the current spectrum crisis. Over the last 15 years, cognitive radio technologies have been extensively studied from algorithmic design to practical implementation. One pressing and fundamental problem is how to integrate cognitive radios into current wireless networks to enhance network capacity and improve users' experience. Unfortunately, existing solutions to cognitive radio networks (CRNs) suffer from many practical design issues. To foster further research activities in this direction, we attempt to provide a tutorial for CRN architecture design. Noticing that an effective architecture for CRNs is still lacking, in this tutorial, we systematically summarize the principles for CRN architecture design and present a novel flexible network architecture, termed cognitive capacity harvesting network (CCHN), to elaborate on how a CRN architecture can be designed. Unlike existing architectures, we introduce a new network entity, called secondary service provider, and deploy cognitive radio capability enabled routers, called cognitive radio routers, in order to effectively and efficiently manage resource harvesting and mobile traffic while enabling users without cognitive radios to access and enjoy CCHN services. Our analysis shows that our CCHN aligns well to industrial standardization activities and hence provides a viable approach to implementing future CRNs. We hope that our proposed design approach opens a new venue to future CRN research.},

  year={2014},
  volume={40},

  pages={533-554},
  abstract={Recommendation systems in software engineering (SE) should be designed to integrate evidence into practitioners experience. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a natural statistical framework for evidence-based decision-making by incorporating an integrated summary of the available evidence and associated uncertainty (of consequences). In this study, we follow the lead of computational biology and healthcare decision-making, and investigate the applications of BNs in SE in terms of 1) main software engineering challenges addressed, 2) techniques used to learn causal relationships among variables, 3) techniques used to infer the parameters, and 4) variable types used as BN nodes. We conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate each of these four facets and compare the current usage of BNs in SE with these two domains. Subsequently, we highlight the main limitations of the usage of BNs in SE and propose a Hybrid BN to improve evidence-based decision-making in SE. In two industrial cases, we build sample hybrid BNs and evaluate their performance. The results of our empirical analyses show that hybrid BNs are powerful frameworks that combine expert knowledge with quantitative data. As researchers in SE become more aware of the underlying dynamics of BNs, the proposed models will also advance and naturally contribute to evidence based-decision-making.},

  abstract={Multicarrier energy systems (MCESs) are characterized by strong coordination in operation and planning across multiple energy vectors and/or sectors to deliver reliable, cost-effective energy services to end users/customers with minimal impact on the environment. They have efficiency and flexibility benefits and are deployed in large and small scales on the supply and demand sides and at the network level but are more complex to control and manage. In this article, MCESs are reviewed in the context of future low carbon energy systems based on electrification and very high variable renewable energy penetrations. Fully exploiting these systems requires some cost reductions, more sophisticated operations enabled by standardized communications and control capabilities detailed planning paradigms, and addressing their corresponding economic challenges. All these point toward the direction of analysis, markets, and technology research and development coupled with better policy and regulatory frameworks. One futuristic vision of a very low carbon energy system is proposed that illustrates potential pathways to an MCES-dominated energy future.},

We propose a set of capabilities and technical features characterizing SMIs, as well as a design for a technological architecture supporting them. To illustrate possible applications enabled by this vision, we present a set of scenarios exploiting the intelligence embedded in SMIs. We also propose a set of guidelines that can help digital luthiers in the process of designing SMIs. Finally, we present a set of directions for future research.},

  abstract={Social network analysis (SNA) has been a research focus in multiple disciplines for decades, including sociology, healthcare, business management, etc. Traditional SNA researches concern more human and social science aspects—trying to undermine the real relationship of people and the impacts of these relationships. While online social networks have become popular in recent years, social media analysis, especially from the viewpoint of computer scientists, is usually limited to the aspects of people's behavior on specific websites and thus are considered not necessarily related to the day-to-day people's behavior and relationships. We conduct research to bridge the gap between social scientists and computer scientists by exploring the multifacet existing social networks in organizations that provide better insights on how people interact with each other in their professional life. We describe a comprehensive study on the challenges and solutions of mining and analyzing existing social networks in enterprise. Several aspects are considered, including system issues; privacy laws; the economic value of social networks; people's behavior modeling including channel, culture, and social inference; social network visualization in large-scale organization; and graph query and mining. The study is based on an SNA tool (SmallBlue) that was designed to overcome practical challenges and is based on the data collected in a global organization of more than 400 000 employees in more than 100 countries.},

  abstract={Since distance education creates new opportunities for learners, the enrollment in online courses has been sharply increasing in higher education. However, the higher attrition rate is one of the more significant concerns in this field. Educational researchers have found that meaningful interactions play a significant role in learner persistence in online courses. Still, it is challenging for an individual instructor to promote learners' positive interaction experiences. The expectation of improved learners' interaction with conversational agent systems has received attention in the distance education field. Few conversational agent systems have been developed for educational purposes, and few systems are used in real online learning settings. This study aims at designing and developing a conversational agent system to promote the learner's meaningful interaction in online courses, and also exploring the feasibility of human interaction with the conversational agent system, or chatbot, in online courses in higher education. The primary findings of this study show that instant, content-related, and quality interactions between the learner and the conversational agent system is applicable to graduate-level online courses. Implications and future research are discussed.},

For this reason, pervasive healthcare, i.e., the provision of healthcare services to individuals anytime anywhere, has become a major focus for the research community. In this paper, we map out the current state of pervasive healthcare research by presenting an overview of three emerging areas in personalized health monitoring, namely: 1) mobile phone sensing via in-built or external sensors, 2) self-reporting for manually captured health information, such as symptoms and behaviors, and 3) social sharing of health information within the individual's community. Systems deployed in a real-life setting as well as proofs-of-concept for achieving pervasive health are presented, in order to identify shortcomings and increase our understanding of the requirements for the next generation of pervasive healthcare systems addressing these three areas.},

  abstract={Modern scientific data management and analysis usually rely on multiple scientists with diverse expertise. In recent years, such a collaborative effort is often structured and automated by a data flow-oriented process called scientific workflow. However, such workflows may have to be designed and revised among multiple scientists over a long time period. Existing workbenches are single user-oriented and do not support scientific workflow application development in a "collaborative fashion". In this paper, we report our research on the enabling techniques in the aspects of collaboration provenance management and reproduciability. Based on a scientific collaboration ontology, we propose a service-oriented collaboration model supported by a set of composable collaboration primitives and patterns. The collaboration protocols are then applied to support effective concurrency control in the process of collaborative workflow composition. We also report the design and development of Confucius, a service-oriented collaborative scientific workflow composition tool that extends an open-source, single-user development environment.},

  abstract={Context: User stories have been widely accepted as artifacts to capture the user requirements in agile software development. They are short pieces of texts in a semi-structured format that express requirements. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer a potential advantage in user story applications. Objective: Conduct a systematic literature review to capture the current state-of-the-art of NLP research on user stories. Method: The search strategy is used to obtain relevant papers from SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to filter the search results. We also use the forward and backward snowballing techniques to obtain more comprehensive results. Results: The search results identified 718 papers published between January 2009 to December 2020. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we identified 38 primary studies that discuss NLP techniques in user stories. Most studies used NLP techniques to extract aspects of who, what, and why from user stories. The purpose of NLP studies in user stories is broad, ranging from discovering defects, generating software artifacts, identifying the key abstraction of user stories, and tracing links between model and user stories. Conclusion: NLP can help system analysts manage user stories. Implementing NLP in user stories has many opportunities and challenges. Considering the exploration of NLP techniques and rigorous evaluation methods is required to obtain quality research. As with NLP research in general, the ability to understand a sentence’s context continues to be a challenge.},

  pages={249-265},
  abstract={In response to public scrutiny of data-driven algorithms, the field of data science has adopted ethics training and principles. Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people&#x0027;s lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance&#x2014;a fundamentally conservative one&#x2014;and why data science&#x0027;s attempts to promote &#x201C;social good&#x201D; dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.},

  abstract={The potential social consequences that may arise as a result of the development and widespread use of ICT are of increasing interest to the general public, policymakers and researchers. Prominent examples include transformations of our concept of privacy when using social networking and other websites, ownership and control of personal data, and the ways crowd-sourced information transform how events are coordinated and how they unfold in real-time. Although there is broad acceptance that questions of professional responsibility are relevant to ICT it is often unclear how this could be achieved or how responsibilities should be defined and managed when considering the potential social consequences of ICT. `Responsible Research and Innovation' (RRI) has emerged in Europe proposing approaches for researchers to identify and consider the potential social consequences and impact of their research outputs within the entire research and innovation lifecycle. First, it asks researchers to take on a practice of critical reflection considering the potential societal impacts of their research outputs, and second to include the general public in a dialogue around the development of research goals and strategy. We discuss findings from interviews conducted with a broad range of stakeholders regarding challenges to identifying, debating and resolving social and ethical concerns associated with ICT research and practice. We also consider how we might extend existing or develop new approaches that facilitate both critical reflection and wider participation within the entire research and innovation lifecycle.},

  number={6},
  pages={1231-1246},
  abstract={Low task execution time and low energy consumption of collaborating mobile human users and robots are important requirements of emerging human-agent-robot teamwork (HART)-centric Tactile Internet applications. In particular, task migration among mobile HART members has emerged as an important research topic, taking different task types, task deadlines, collaborative node capabilities, and mobility patterns into account. We propose a context-aware task migration scheme for efficiently orchestrating the real-time collaboration among human mobile users, central and decentralized computational agents (cloud/cloudlets), and collaborative robots (cobots) across converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) communications infrastructures. We investigate the problem of whether and, if so, when and where a HART-centric task should be best migrated to. For resource-efficient task execution, the migration decision is made according to given task processing capabilities of cloud/cloudlet agents and cobots, task execution deadline, energy consumption of involved cobots and mobile devices, and task migration latency. We evaluate the performance of our context-aware HART-centric task migration scheme and compare it to conventional task execution without migration. Towards this end, we develop an analytical framework for quantifying its performance in terms of a variety of task migration key performance metrics, including task migration gain-overhead ratio, deadline-miss ratio, task response time, and energy consumption efficiency.},

  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  abstract={A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs. This user centered approach has proved fruitful, but there exists relatively little work examining the intent and values of the roboticists themselves. Furthermore, we know little of how the values of roboticists influence their own designs. Such knowledge could help designers better reflect on whether their designs effectively convey particular ethics to their users. In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids). Roboticists also see robots as testbeds for learning about humans themselves. We advocate a VSD approach for humanoids that goes beyond engineering disciplines and forces values to the forefront of discussion.},

  abstract={The challenge of Nigeria’s food insecurity in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, insecurity, climate change, population growth, food wastage, etc., is a demanding task. This study addresses Nigeria’s food insecurity challenges by adopting agriculture 4.0 and commercial farming. Using data from six digital libraries, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, and other internet sources, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR using PRISMA) on Nigeria’s agriculture, food security, and agriculture 4.0. Our results show Nigeria’s current agricultural state, threats to food security, and modern digital agriculture technologies. We adapted our SLR findings to develop an implementation framework for agriculture 4.0 in solving Nigeria’s food insecurity challenge in the post-Covid-19 era. Our proposed framework integrates precision agriculture in Nigeria’s food production and the necessary enabling digital technologies in the agri-food supply chain. We analyzed the critical implementation considerations during each agri-food supply chain stage of farming inputs, farming scale, farming approach, farming operation, food processing, food preservation/storage, distribution/logistics, and the final consumers. This study will help researchers, investors, and the government address food security in Nigeria. The implementation of agriculture 4.0 will substantially contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) of #Envision 2030 of the United Nations, for the benefit of Nigeria, Africa, and the entire world.},

In 2012 a new initiative to restart the debate on major grand challenges for modeling and simulation (M&S) began. Leading researchers have presented M&S Grand Challenges in areas such as ubiquitous simulation, high performance computing, spatial simulation, big simulation, human behaviour, multidomain design, systems engineering, cyber systems, network simulation and education. To contribute further to this initiative, this paper presents M&S Grand Challenges from an Operational Research/Management Science (OR/MS) perspective and discusses themes including simulation in healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based simulation and simulation analytics.},

  pages={118664-118672},
  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that may lead to significant impairment in social communication, repetitive patterns of behavior, and possible fixed and restricted interests. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a well-supported and evidence-based treatment for the delays attributed to ASD. Assistive technologies, such as gamification, software apps, computer-based training (Web), and robotics; provide a standardized method of implementing ABA techniques. This review provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of these technologies. The assessed proposals focused on technologies such as Distributed Systems, Image Processing, Gamification, and Robotics. The primary objectives of these tools sought to improve social behavior, attention, communication, and reading skills. Some common limitations found in the literature was a failure to accurately define their target audience, and a failure to comply with the dimensions of ABA as defined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968.},

  abstract={With the popularity of mobile devices and the development of the wireless technologies, humans can be connected ubiquitously. Because of the mobility of the devices, it is a hard task to maintain the end-to-end path between source node and destination node. Researchers have introduced analysis of nodes' social behavior to solve the problem of data dissemination in the networks, which leads to the emersion of the Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). They increase the performance of data forwarding by the social relationships and interactions among nodes. Many schemes and algorithms have been proposed to enhance data forwarding performance and provide humanized service by introducing social features and digging social properties. In this paper, first, we investigate the architectures and evolutionary process of the MSNs. Then, the social features of nodes existing in the MSNs and main social properties of MSNs are described. In term of the state-of-the-art works, data forwarding strategies in the MSNs are divided into four categories, including only encounter history-based strategies, social-based strategies, incentive mechanisms, and forwarding methods that take social selfishness into consideration of this paper. Finally, the major issues and challenges are discussed.},

  abstract={Global Software Development (GSD) is a well established field of software engineering with the benefits of a global environment. Software Project Management (SPM) plays a key role in the success of GSD. As a result, the need has arisen to study and evaluate the downsides of SPM for GSD, to thereby pave the way for the development of new methods, techniques, and tools with which to tackle them. This paper aims to identify and classify research on SPM approaches for GSD that are available in the literature, to identify their current weaknesses and strengths, and to analyze their applications in industry. We performed a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on six classification criteria. Eighty-four papers were selected and analyzed. The results indicate that interest in SPM for GSD has been increasing since 2006. As a class of approaches, the most frequently reported methods (40%) are those used for coordination, planning, and monitoring, along with estimation techniques that can be used to better match a distributed project. SPM for GSD requires further investigation by researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to cost and time estimations. These findings will help overcome the challenges that must to be considered in future SPM research for GSD, especially regarding collaboration and time-zone differences.},

Developing digital pervasive games involves additional requirements, such as dealing with ubiquitous computing challenges. Part of these requirements affect directly the design and development processes of pervasive games. Software Engineering techniques should be adapted to increase the overall quality of game software. The main objective of this paper is to present a systematic review of this area in order to capture the state of the art research in Software Engineering for Pervasive Games. A standard systematic review methodology using digital databases for research was applied and 100 relevant studies were found within 1304 obtained from searches.

  volume={14},

  pages={3904-3915},
  abstract={As a new computing paradigm, crowd-based cooperative computing aims at effective management and the coordinated use of crowd resources. In crowd-based cooperative task allocation (CBCTA), it is necessary to ensure the suitability and high-quality collaboration of resources for computer supported cooperative work. Generally, the high matching rate between resource and task requirements can achieve the optimal parameter configuration, whereas high-quality collaboration ensures the quality and success rates of crowd-based cooperative task. This article proposes a methodology to optimize the resource allocation model for solving CBCTA problems in a cost-efficient, requirements adapted fashion. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics to find proper resources that optimally balance matching rate and collaborative quality. We also present suitable metrics to quantify the aforementioned targets. Furthermore, the obtained solutions are ranked based on multicriteria decision making to provide a flexible design choice for decision-makers. Different scales of CBCTA problems are conducted to illustrate the value of the proposed methodology. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology is effective and feasible.},

The design of the game and adaptation mechanisms integrated with it are aimed at maintaining student engagement for the duration of an open-ended number of playing sessions, while using a limited quantity of assets and literacy content.

  abstract={Ubiquitous technologies such as mobile software applications (mobile apps) have a tremendous influence on the evolution of the social, cultural, economic, and political facets of life in society. Mobile apps fulfil many practical purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial management, etc. Given the ubiquity of mobile apps in the lives of individuals and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to consider the relationship between human values and the development and deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values requirements.},

  volume={14},

  pages={367-385},
  abstract={Collaboration is one of the important 21st-century skills. It can take place in remote or co-located settings. Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very complex process that involves subtle human interactions that can be described with indicators like eye gaze, speaking time, pitch, and social skills from different modalities. With the advent of sensors, multimodal learning analytics has gained momentum to detect CC quality. Indicators (or low-level events) can be used to detect CC quality with the help of measurable markers (i.e., indexes composed of one or more indicators) which give the high-level collaboration process definition. However, this understanding is incomplete without considering the scenarios (such as problem solving or meetings) of CC. The scenario of CC affects the set of indicators considered: For instance, in collaborative programming, grabbing the mouse from the partner is an indicator of collaboration; whereas in collaborative meetings, eye gaze, and audio level are indicators of collaboration. This can be a result of the differing goals and fundamental parameters (such as group behavior, interaction, or composition) in each scenario. In this article, we present our work on profiles of indicators on the basis of a scenario-driven prioritization, the parameters in different CC scenarios are mapped onto the indicators and the available indexes. This defines the conceptual model to support the design of a CC quality detection and prediction system.},

The findings indicate that colleagues play a significant role in information seeking activities, but there is need for better methods of capturing and retaining information from them during development. Also, in terms of online information sources, there is need for more centralization, improved access and organization of resources, and more consistency among formats.

The emerging crowdsourcing paradigm is based on harnessing human intelligence, effort and rational behaviors to augment computation and analysis. In addition to the crowdsourcing paradigm, new techniques have emerged that incorporate machine and human computational resources together forming a hybrid intelligence when addressing complex problems and tasks. This combined technique is particularly impactful if human and machine contributions can scale automatically in response to their respective efficiency and effectiveness when addressing subsets of a bigger problem - an approach that we have named mixed elastic systems. In this survey, we highlight state-of-the-art projects that investigate crowdsourcing, hybrid intelligence systems and mixed elastic systems.

Health area has been benefited from the advent of Virtual Reality (VR) especially in education area, where these systems present some advantages over traditional teaching methods such as: cost reduction for training, reducing the use of guinea pigs and anatomical specimens in laboratory practices as well the use of interactive teaching approaches. Another VR's feature is the ability to monitor user's actions for assessing training performance.

  year={2016},
  volume={10},

  pages={952-961},
  abstract={Persons who have lost their larynx and thus speech functionality need to use a substitution voice to regain speech. The electro-larynx (EL) is a widely used device but is known for its unnatural and monotonic speech quality. Previous research has addressed these problems, but until now no significant improvements could be reported. Moreover, the importance of human-centered computing and co-adaptation was only considered marginally. The EL speech system is a complex system including hardware (artificial excitation source or sound transducer), software (control and generation of the artificial excitation signal) and most important of all, the human user. Taking one isolated problem into consideration is not an adequate approach here, since all aspects of the EL speech system need to be integrated into a holistic approach. We have responded by pushing forward the boundaries of the conventional EL device toward a new bionic electro-larynx speech system. In this paper, we review existing approaches and summarize the most important findings. Subsequently, we piece together an overall speech system, which integrates several parts to significantly improve EL speech: we study electromyographic signals to analyze their suitability for hands-free on/off control of the EL speech system and investigate learning effects in the training of naive users. We propose a new transducer for the EL speech system based on electromagnetic mechanisms. The technical properties of the new transducer show significant advantages over the conventional electro-dynamic transducer. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to estimate a changing fundamental frequency from the speech spectral envelope and an optimized waveform shape for the excitation signal. Listening tests show that a changing fundamental frequency improves the perceived naturalness of EL speech. Listening tests serve as a proof of concept for the resulting EL speech system, which confirm that the proposed system is very promising.},

  abstract={Experts in data and physical sciences have to regularly grapple with the problem of competing models. Be it analytical or physics-based models, a cross-cutting challenge for experts is to reliably diagnose which model outcomes appropriately predict or simulate real-world phenomena. Expert judgment involves reconciling information across many, and often, conflicting criteria that describe the quality of model outcomes. In this paper, through a design study with climate scientists, we develop a deeper understanding of the problem and solution space of model diagnostics, resulting in the following contributions: i) a problem and task characterization using which we map experts' model diagnostics goals to multi-way visual comparison tasks, ii) a design space of comparative visual cues for letting experts quickly understand the degree of disagreement among competing models and gauge the degree of stability of model outputs with respect to alternative criteria, and iii) design and evaluation of MyriadCues, an interactive visualization interface for exploring alternative hypotheses and insights about good and bad models by leveraging comparative visual cues. We present case studies and subjective feedback by experts, which validate how MyriadCues enables more transparent model diagnostic mechanisms, as compared to the state of the art.},

  year={2022},
  volume={15},

  pages={260-272},
  abstract={Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of heart and vasculature conditions which are the leading form of mortality worldwide. Blood vessels can become narrowed, restricting blood flow, and drive the majority of hearts attacks and strokes. Reactive surgical interventions are frequently required; including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Despite successful opening of vessels and restoration of blood flow, often in-stent restenosis (ISR) and graft failure can still occur, resulting in subsequent patient morbidity and mortality. A new generation of cardiovascular implants that have sensors and real-time monitoring capabilities are being developed to combat ISR and graft failure. Self-reporting stent/graft technology could enable precision medicine-based and predictive healthcare by detecting the earliest features of disease, even before symptoms occur. Bringing an implantable medical device with wireless electronic sensing capabilities to market is complex and often obstructive undertaking. This critical review analyses the obstacles that need to be overcome for self-reporting stents/grafts to be developed and provide a precision-medicine based healthcare for cardiovascular patients. Here we assess the latest research and technological advancement in the field, the current devices; including smart cardiovascular implantable biosensors and associated wireless data and power transfer solutions. We include an evaluation of devices that have reached clinical trials and the market potential for their end-user implementation.},

  abstract={A medical cyber–physical system (MCPS) is a unique cyber–physical system (CPS), which combines embedded software control devices, networking capabilities, and complex physiological dynamics of patients in the modern medical field. In the process of communication, device, and information system interaction of MCPS, medical cyber–physical data are generated digitally, stored electronically, and accessed remotely by medical staff or patients. With the advent of the era of medical big data, a large amount of medical cyber–physical data is collected, and its sharing provides great value for diagnosis, pathological analysis, epidemic tracking, pharmaceutical, insurance, and so on. This overview will present MCPS’s architectures and frameworks from different perspectives, modeling and verification methods, identification and sign sensing technologies, key communications’ technologies, data storage and analysis technologies, monitoring systems, data security and privacy protection technologies, and key research perspectives and directions. We can have a comprehensive understanding of the important characteristics and technical route of MCPS, and grasp its research status and progress.},

  abstract={With new technologies such as body sensors, tangible interaction, haptics, interactive cloth, or small computing devices such as mobiles, we can move interaction from the desktop out into the world and onto our bodies. Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for non-instrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI. We suggest that learning technologies could use some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experience to happen, but in the end, it is the user who co-constructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving dasiasurfacespsila open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognise themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism.},

  year={2023},
  volume={70},
  number={11},
  pages={3745-3765},
  abstract={An ever-growing number of companies are moving toward the Industry 4.0 paradigm, adopting a range of advanced technologies (e.g., smart sensors, big data analytics, and cloud computing) and networking their manufacturing systems. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of operations but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments. In particular, based on this study, companies can define the critical manufacturing data to protect against cyber-attacks, isolate the business impacts in case of cybersecurity breaches, correlate the identified business impacts with the specific data category, and assess the level of business impacts.},

  year={2023},
  volume={41},
  number={5},
  pages={1265-1308},
  abstract={Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a powerful multiple access, interference management, and multi-user strategy for next generation communication systems. In this tutorial, we depart from the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) versus non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) discussion held in 5G, and the conventional multi-user linear precoding approach used in space-division multiple access (SDMA), multi-user and massive MIMO in 4G and 5G, and show how multi-user communications and multiple access design for 6G and beyond should be intimately related to the fundamental problem of interference management. We start from foundational principles of interference management and rate-splitting, and progressively delineate RSMA frameworks for downlink, uplink, and multi-cell networks. We show that, in contrast to past generations of multiple access techniques (OMA, NOMA, SDMA), RSMA offers numerous benefits: 1) enhanced spectral, energy and computation efficiency; 2) universality by unifying and generalizing OMA, SDMA, NOMA, physical-layer multicasting, multi-user MIMO under a single framework that holds for any number of antennas at each node (SISO, SIMO, MISO, and MIMO settings); 3) flexibility by coping with any interference levels (from very weak to very strong), network loads (underloaded, overloaded), services (unicast, multicast), traffic, user deployments (channel directions and strengths); 4) robustness to inaccurate channel state information (CSI) and resilience to mixed-critical quality of service; 5) reliability under short channel codes and low latency. We then discuss how those benefits translate into numerous opportunities for RSMA in over forty different applications and scenarios of 6G, e.g., multi-user MIMO with statistical/quantized CSI, FDD/TDD/cell-free massive MIMO, millimeter wave and terahertz, cooperative relaying, physical layer security, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, cloud-radio access network, internet-of-things, massive access, joint communication and jamming, non-orthogonal unicast and multicast, multigroup multicast, multibeam satellite, space-air-ground integrated networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, integrated sensing and communications, grant-free access, network slicing, cognitive radio, optical/visible light communications, mobile edge computing, machine/federated learning, etc. We finally address common myths and answer frequently asked questions, opening the discussions to interesting future research avenues. Supported by the numerous benefits and applications, the tutorial concludes on the underpinning role played by RSMA in next generation networks, which should inspire future research, development, and standardization of RSMA-aided communication for 6G.},

  title={How Can Human Values be Addressed in Agile Methods? A Case Study on SAFe}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={48},
  number={12},
  pages={5158-5175},
  abstract={Agile methods are predominantly focused on delivering business values. But can Agile methods be adapted to effectively address and deliver human values such as social justice, privacy, and sustainability in the software they produce? Human values are what an individual or a society considers important in life. Ignoring these human values in software can pose difficulties or risks for all stakeholders (e.g., user dissatisfaction, reputation damage, financial loss). To answer this question, we selected the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), one of the most commonly used Agile methods in the industry, and conducted a qualitative case study to identify possible intervention points within SAFe that are the most natural to address and integrate human values in software. We present five high-level empirically-justified sets of interventions in SAFe: artefacts, roles, ceremonies, practices, and culture. We elaborate how some current Agile artefacts (e.g., user story), roles (e.g., product owner), ceremonies (e.g., stand-up meeting), and practices (e.g., business-facing testing) in SAFe can be modified to support the inclusion of human values in software. Further, our study suggests new and exclusive values-based artefacts (e.g., legislative requirement), ceremonies (e.g., values conversation), roles (e.g., values champion), and cultural practices (e.g., induction and hiring) to be introduced in SAFe for this purpose. Guided by our findings, we argue that existing Agile methods can account for human values in software delivery with some evolutionary adaptations.},

  abstract={Current research has shown that global software development (GSD) organizations rely on agile methods to guarantee better communication, coordination, and improved productivity. Moreover, as organizations continue to grow, they are facing large-scale global project challenges and complexity, leading to an urge to scale agile practices for better coordination. However, it has been surprising to find that approaches in the literature on scaling agile for large and global projects remain unclear. In addition, to identify and highlight which agile scales practices reported in studies on Agile GSD (AGSD) are related to SAFe practices, we conducted a systematic literature review. Besides, we mapped AGSD practices to the SAFe 5.0 framework to provide bases for those starting on such a journey. In our study, we found 24 articles related to the scaling of agile practices in a global environment, and 44 scaling agile practices that embrace 95 SAFe 5.0 components, including “agile coaching,” “agile architecture,” and “system demo”. This study provides an in-depth scientific investigation on how SAFe can be associated with global teams applying GSD. The results and findings will benefit researchers and practitioners in conducting further research and provide more dedicated solutions for challenges to scaling agile in the context of GSD.},

Our works on the reengineering driven by models of e-learning systems, propose an architecture for usage analysis and a meta-language for describing the tracks' semantic and for linking them to observation needs defined in the predictive scenario. This architecture wants to be a collaborative cluster of services available for and designed by a community of practices on usage analysis. Concerning our meta-language UTL, we consider that it is important to interpret tracks in order to compare the designer's intentions with the learners' activities during a session.},

  abstract={The locus of innovation has shifted from mechanical advances to digital solutions. By emphasizing the importance of user needs, Design Thinking is apt to develop human-centered innovation, including digital solutions. Using two representative examples from 21 Design Thinking projects spanning the gamut of mechatronic to fully digital solutions, we report on critical incidents as opportunities and challenges of applying Design Thinking in a digital context. In the case of mechatronic solutions, we identified opportunities related to improved collaboration and higher quality prototyping as well as in innovative business models, which in turn created challenges in managing stakeholders. In the fully digital context, we observed opportunities in improved needfinding and the ability to offer individualized products. Conversely, we uncover difficulties in imagining digital features, estimating their feasibility, and correctly setting the fidelity of prototypes. Based on these observations, we discuss the intangibility of digital artifacts as enabler and inhibitor of Design Thinking in a digital context.},

  abstract={Health-related online communities are increasingly popular platforms on which consumers engage in peer-to-peer communication while seeking and providing health-related information. These platforms provide an empirical account of user communications related to health behaviors. Several advanced analytical approaches have been developed to unearth and characterize social influence mechanisms embedded in these platforms. However, translating these insights into design features of consumer-facing health promotion information systems presents very significant challenges. In this paper, we present a design methodology that utilizes persuasive principles and lessons learned from large-scale analysis of an online community for smoking cessation, to harness social influence and implement as technological features of a behavior support intervention. We transformed observed social diffusion patterns underlying user communication events to user-participatory interactions that can potentially lead to superior user engagement through meaningful network affiliations and thence to sustained healthy behavior change.

  abstract={In the past two decades, human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers have increasingly deployed autonomous and reliable robots long-term in various social contexts including the home. Our work provides a mixed-method approach for analyzing older adults' long-term robot usage data patterns combining quantitative data of robot usage logs with qualitative descriptions from participants' own experience. Overall, this provides a fuller picture to how older adults use and experience social robots in their homes. Our work involves a robot hosting period for at least a month (up to 12 months) in older adults' homes with an experience debrief session held a month into the robot hosting time period. We propose reflections on the novelty effect with respect to older adults' usage data and highlight feelings of guilt, the robot's proactivity and movement, meeting (or not meeting) user expectations, and the robot's persona as key aspects of the hosting experience that promoted usage or non-usage. Finally, we provide design guidelines for structuring future mixed-method long-term robot usage studies being mindful of ethical considerations in this space.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is the latest trend in business for providing software, platforms and services over the Internet. However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.},

  abstract={Computational Politics is the study of computational methods to analyze and moderate users' behaviors related to political activities such as election campaign persuasion, political affiliation, and opinion mining. With the rapid development and ease of access to the Internet, Information Communication Technologies (ICT) have given rise to massive numbers of users joining online communities and the digitization of political practices such as debates. These communities and digitized data contain both explicit and latent information about users and their behaviors related to politics and social movements. For researchers, it is essential to utilize data from these sources to develop and design systems that not only provide solutions to computational politics but also help other businesses, such as marketers, to increase users' participation and interactions. In this survey, we attempt to categorize main areas in computational politics and summarize the prominent studies in one place to better understand computational politics across different and multidimensional platforms. e.g., online social networks, online forums, and political debates. We then conclude this study by highlighting future research directions, opportunities, and challenges.},

  abstract={Massive connectivity of billions of communicating devices for fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks requires the deployment of self-sustaining, maintenance-free, and low-cost communication paradigms. Could passive Internet of Things (IoT) solve these challenges? Passive IoT can be realized with the backscatter communication (BackCom) paradigm, which uses ultra-low power, inexpensive passive tags to support massive connectivity. However, a comprehensive link budget analysis for BackCom networks has not yet been available. It is something that is necessary for practitioners and researchers to evaluate the potential of BackCom. This survey is organized as follows. First, we describe the BackCom configurations, passive IoT design targets, backscatter channel statistics, and the different components and operations of the backscatter tag. Second, we develop the forward link budget and the overall link budget. All the relevant parameters are described in detail. Third, we give numerical and simulation results to get insights on the achievable performance of BackCom networks. Since additive path losses and excess fading can limit the performance of BackCom networks, we examine potential solutions to overcome the resulting limitations, enabling massive IoT networks. We also discuss integrating BackCom with existing wireless technologies. We further highlight some applications and address open issues, challenges, and future research directions.},

A highly- expert seven (7) partner consortium, coordinated by Cyprus University of Technology (CUT) leverages the support of a unique and powerful Advisory Group, consisting of many of the Europe and the world's leading public and private sector organisations in the field, to define and support high quality policies, strategic and day-to-day decision making, the utilisation of breakthrough technological developments such as VR/AR and to nurture an evidence-based view of growth and development impacted by VM, supported by a set of case studies in culturally- rich regions of South Europe affected by economic recession. Its work is founded on building a consensual framework directly involving Europe's leading VM decision-makers and practitioners in defining and resolving existing issues spread across 7 interlinked Thematic Areas (`the 7 Ds'): Definitions -Directions - Documentation - Dimensions - Demand- Discovery - Decisions and aims to achieve wide-reaching stakeholder participation and very high visibility, the latter to be achieved through organisation of key events at policy and practitioner/ stakeholder levels, extensive use of the media, and by the introduction of an interactive and wide-reaching communication platform, deploying social media and novel approaches to enable focused debate by all interested parties, supported by access to representations of excellence and a decision-support tool for stakeholders. An initially broad and open approach is being refined to arrive at a validated Manifesto and Roadmap for Action on VM/DCH, validated at a final ViMM international conference. Measurable impacts are sought on the role and capability of DCH to meet its enormous potential in society and the economy.},
