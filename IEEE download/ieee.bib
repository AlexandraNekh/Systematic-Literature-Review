  abstract={Current trends in the design of road systems are driven by the digitalization process. Work on the introduction of intelligent transport systems is being carried out all over the world, because the improvement of the road network is an important element in creating comfortable conditions for the movement of people in an urbanized environment; a tool for improving road safety. Based on interdisciplinary research methods in the framework of urban planning, the paper proposes a methodology for assessing the prospects for the development of an intelligent city transport system within the framework of the concept of participatory design. The formation of the transport system is seen as a process of coordination of institutional and civil needs. The goal of the joint work of urban planners and civil society is to improve the safety of road infrastructure, not only through the development and implementation of quality standards, but also through the internalization (recognition) of the value of new technologies by the society. It is necessary to introduce the principles of participatory design of the transport system into the development of the road network, the urban space should remain free for co-creation. The problem of the study is that technologies for improving road safety, including the use of artificial intelligence, automation systems for traffic management processes depending on the rhythm of the city, weather conditions, time of day (traffic flow detectors, CCTV cameras, "smart traffic lights", weather stations, vehicle traffic sensors, navigation information systems, weather information display systems, environmental pollution sensors, traffic control centers, etc.) can be perceived by citizens primarily as devices that restrict freedom of movement, and not as means of improving road safety},

  abstract={There has been a tremendous growth of digital health applications within healthcare. Clinicians are inundated with new types of data to synthesize in a timely manner to make a clinical decisions about the care of their patients. The overwhelming abundance of data leads to physician burnout, which is a major problem within healthcare. In parallel, there is an immense hype building up about implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, to augment clinician decision making processes. Healthcare is a highly regulated environment so it's imperative to involve clinicians and data scientists in the entire model development, validation and implementation lifecycle. There ought to be a mechanism in place for integration of human feedback to build trust in the AI model, through human in the loop implementation models and participatory design approaches. The overarching aim of this stury is to formulate a problem statement and propose the development a system dynamics model highlighting the feedback loops within clinical decision-making workflows leading to diffusion of innovation of AI within healthcare. We propose system dynamics modelling as a mechanism to articulate the problems that are best suited for AI models, and conceptualize how the models would fit into the current workflow.},

  abstract={At present, it is difficult to handle unexpected exceptions in collaborative design. Ad-hoc methods are important ones, but how to utilize the expert experience efficiently, especially, store those in structured format and not to lose any information and interact under more user-friendly interface during handling exceptions, seem a mission impossible. Aiming at those, we proposed a question answering mechanism based approach for handling unexpected exceptions in collaborative design, which have some good characteristics, 1) unexpected exception handling is treated as a question answering mechanism so as to be more user-friendly, 2) in which exception handler can use natural language to define an exception; 3) expert experience are stored in natural language, there is no information loss; 4) higher efficiency, extendability and precision. In this paper, two approaches for mining similar records are proposed, and their performance comparison is shown},

  abstract={In order to improve the manufacturability of products and enhance the efficiency of communication during the co-design process, it is important to focus on the problem of inconsistent representation of concepts in the design and manufacturing domains; In the co-design process, it is important to consider the management of relevant data, such as the management of data upload, modification and access rights. Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a framework for dual fusion of knowledge data in co-design based on blockchain and ontology methods. Firstly, the ontology method is used to establish the framework for knowledge unification, and the knowledge and concepts in the design and manufacturing fields are unified so as to realize the purpose of concept unification and meet the needs of efficient communication. Secondly, the blockchain method is used to establish the data management system. Through signing the smart contract, the use authority of the data involved is limited, so as to realize the data fusion in the co-design process. In the co-design process, parallel and integrated design and manufacturing processes can be realized, and product manufacturability and communication efficiency between designers and manufacturing engineers can be improved through knowledge fusion and data fusion.},

  abstract={The Participatory Design and End-User Program-ming for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) workshop aims to advance research on how to design systems that can be used by end users to program robots. There tends to be a fracture in HRI between the technical designers of robot programs (often engineers or computer scientists) and the actual users of such robots. Developers have the capabilities to program robots but often lack insights possessed by domain experts, sometimes leading to technically interesting but impractical systems. With this workshop, we aim to bridge two different methods often used individually within the wider HRI community to involve end users in robot program design: Participatory Design (PD) and End-User Programming (EUP). Both methods empower end users to co-produce robots addressing real-world needs. However, there have been limited opportunities to unite researchers who specialize in these areas and engage in mutual learning. We will address this shortcoming with a full-day workshop, which will put the PD and EUP communities in touch, inviting speakers from both sides and welcoming a wide range of publications from describing new end-user programming methods to compiling insights learned from conducting participatory design studies.},

The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) report [1] highlighted the need to "establish justified confidence in AI systems," and further acknowledged that "the United States will field safe and reliable AI…" through the execution of existing procedures. This acknowledgment reinforces the prevailing thought from the U.S. Army Combat Capability Development Command Armaments Center (DEVCOM AC) that there are robust processes in place to mitigate risks, such as the Army Materiel Release (MR) process, but the key is how to tailor them to ensure continued application.The Materiel Release process, which ensure systems are safe, suitable, and supportable, as written may be a challenging process to adhere to by AI-enabled projects. There are facets of the AI technology that currently make it difficult to proceed through the process. The authors spent years engaged with MR stakeholders, board members, coordinator, and chair to identify the prevailing concerns, risks, and proposed mitigations, which eventually formed into a roadmap to properly and thoroughly review an AI enabled system. The validated roadmap has helped reduce risks, educate stakeholders, identify gaps, and suggest future solutions to both the process and products to ensure safety, suitability, and supportability to the Warfighter and DoD mission.},

  abstract={In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of press and attention. Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles. The author's aim is to set out obstacles and realistic alternatives for next generation project managers to apply AI in managing stakeholder expectations, resolving dissent and conflicts, and assuring flawless project delivery.},

  pages={233-237},
  abstract={The collaborative design is an important style for modern design. But the conflict appears in the process of design which may interface the design. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a good method for conflict resolution, which has been applied in the artificial intelligence field successfully. However, due to the uncertainties in knowledge representation, attribute description, and similarity measures of CBR, it is very difficult to find the similar cases from case database. To solve the problem of conflict resolution in collaborative design, a fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. The process of fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is introduced. Based on the feature attributes and their relative weights determined by a fuzzy technique, a fuzzy CBR retrieving mechanism is developed to retrieve conflict resolution cases that tend to enhance the functions of the database. The theory and methods of fuzzy CBR is applied to define the cases. By indexing, calculating the weight and defuzzication of the cases, the case similarity can be obtained. Then the case consistency is measured to keep the result right. Finally, the method is demonstrated availably for conflict resolution by means of a case study.},

  abstract={Integrate multidisciplinary virtual teams in collaborative design process is a hard task to tackle with. Differences of background, culture and expertise usually lead to conflicting situations. Moreover, if we consider to be working on a synchronous environment — where all designers exchange data and share information at the same time that the product design is being done — potential knowledge representation conflicts can also arise from this process. In our work we currently represent knowledge in collaborative design by using Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is structured to be a major formalism for the design and dissemination of ontology information. The use of OWL reasoning is intended to be a consistent way to verify the information given by several experts, trying to avoid redundancies, contradictions and misunderstood. This paper presents an approach to detect collaborative design conflicts through the use of an OWL inference engine.},

This concept characterizes collaborative design in terms of two models introduced in this article -an annotation model with a semantic metadata notion - and a knowledge model to capitalize and to manage annotations - MATRICS environment. We briefly describe this approach. Then we present the results of an empirical study in which subjects performed annotation tasks with the support of an ontology visualization 2D tool and through the navigation in the 3D annotations. This study shows that the knowledge model improves the quality of the understanding of design projects.},

  abstract={Recent advancements of technologies, including computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization technologies, bring us closer to futuristic visions of compassionate intelligent devices. The missing element is a basic understanding of how to relate human functions (physiological, physical, and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people. Our stakeholder and clinician consultants identified a number of mobility barriers that have been intransigent to traditional approaches. The most important physical obstacles are stairs, steps, curbs, doorways (doors), rough/uneven surfaces, weather hazards (snow, ice), crowded/cluttered spaces, and confined spaces. Focus group participants suggested a number of ways to make interaction simpler, including natural language interfaces such as the ability to say ";I want a drink";, a library of high level commands (open a door, park the wheelchair, ...), and a touchscreen interface with images so the user could point and use other gestures.},

  abstract={We are living in an ageing population with an escalation in chronic illnesses including dementia and other age related diseases. People living with dementia often continue to live at home and are supported by caregivers and next of kin. It is often important to monitor the wellbeing of people living with dementia in order to measure their level of independence and to provide proper support at the time of need as well as supporting their quality of life. Some researchers have focused on monitoring physical wellbeing and activities of daily living (ADL). However, there has been a paucity of research focussed on monitoring mood, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia, despite these people experiencing frustration, agitation, depression and social isolation to name but a few known effects. As a result, the SenseCare project aims to build an affective computing platform that uses sensors placed in the home environment to monitor moods, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia. This platform is being iteratively designed and will likely use plug-n-play sensors such as passive infrared, wearables and camera technologies to infer emotions from facial expressions, voice intonations and physical behaviour and other modalities. However, it is important to interact iteratively with people living with dementia and their caregivers in order to understand their profound needs. In this study, we report on two focus groups that were conducted to elicit user stories and eventual requirements for the SenseCare platform. Since participatory design involving people living with dementia could bring about unique challenges, we adopted a dyad approach where a caregiver and the person living with dementia participate together in the focus group. This ensures that their needs are fully represented and that consent is fully transparent. In this paper, we report the personal stories elicited during these discussions which will ultimately inform the implementation of the SenseCare platform.},

In a manufacture system, a good method can be captured to model the process of collaborative design. But the present process modeling techniques are not sufficient to model the process, which is are IDEF, UML and ARIS. Colored Petri nets is proposed to model the whole process of the collaborative design. The process of collaborative design is a dynamic process and the colored Petri nets can describe the process. The allocation of task, the conflict resolution and other processes are all expressed in the model. The result suggests that the model is suit to express the process of design and it is good to know the whole process of collaborative design. By doing it, the system can be realized successfully.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) literacy has recently been identified as one of critical skills students need to succeed as future creators and innovators. While the significance of introducing ML basics at kindergarten to twelfth grade (K-12) levels is increasingly acknowledged, there is limited research that focuses specifically on collaborative design of ML applications with middle school students. We posit that engaging young children to co-invent and make concrete prototypes improves their ideas, encourages them to become active participants, and allows them to establish the implications of the technology in their everyday lives. In order to lay the foundation for middle school ML education, we collaboratively designed and prototyped ML applications with 43 eighth grade students (ages 11 to 14) in a Nigerian school. The ideas generated by the students indicate that they began to identify the applicability of ML to their daily lives and as a solution to a plethora of societal challenges. This study provides learners’ input and preliminary insights into approaches that could be adopted to promote ML within the compulsory level of education in an African setting. The research contributes to the limited body of knowledge available on effectively teaching ML to young learners using design-oriented pedagogy, especially in the context of an emerging country.},

The pipeline was able to ingest demographic data and near real-time continuous physiological data, run through a model, and output the results twice a day automatically. It was a highly collaborative effort among clinical neurologists, the research team, and the IT innovation team. We illustrate the technical run time challenges and mitigations in each of the three components of the pipeline: data, model (modular), and output communication.

  abstract={It has been many years now the concept of smart city evolved, with the beginning of a new era in urban innovation called Smart cities. Since that time there has been many studies made to discuss and understand this new concept with its application and acceptance worldwide. It is very obvious that smart cities will make things much complex but also ease our life style with high-tech solutions at the urban context. The study discusses various smart initiatives of top three ranked smart cities (London, Singapore & Seoul) by the smart government and the user experience. However research still fall short to understand the success of participatory design in use of smart concepts and the smart knowledge in day-to-day life. Policy makers and practitioners both need to deal with these progressive developments and digital connections. One example of this is the popular anonymous England based street artist who is known for his satirical street art regarding political activism, social causes and ironic realities of civic life. This work can truly be experienced in person yet does not require any digital media to enhance the experience. In order to explore the recent scenario of smart cities a survey is conducted to analyze the role of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in place making of Dubai. Though smart cities bring many complexities with them but same time they also ease and improve lifestyles. IoT and AI are very essential key elements during the entire process of planning for smart cities.},

  abstract={Effective real-time network measurement provides a basis for generating routing optimization strategies, so that the network can sense congestion. The existing out of band network telemetry technology will transmit additional probes to measure the network status, which will inevitably lead to the "observer" effect, leading to inaccurate measurement information. In addition, it is difficult to describe the relationship between complex network states and routing optimization strategies with accurate mathematical models. Let some neurons stop working temporarily, reduce the interaction between neurons, implicitly delete neurons in the network, and prevent some functional synergies to alleviate excessive matching. The algorithm selects temporarily discarded neurons with random probability, while the optimization algorithm uses Ising model in machine learning data to identify neurons with low link energy, and temporarily discards these neurons in training and reasoning. This algorithm makes the model more general and effectively alleviates the over fitting problem of network training. Its purpose is to select key features closely related to the learning purpose or eliminate irrelevant features to improve the performance of the model. Feature sparse methods can be divided into two categories. And in machine learning, the use of control algorithms can effectively improve the development of machine learning, and in machine learning, the proportion of optimization using control algorithms is very large. This paper puts forward many new ideas, hoping to improve the use of machine learning control algorithm.},

  pages={590-595},
  abstract={Collaborative design entails sharing knowledge in an effective way and from a variety of sources, which raises the need of developing technology-enabled systems that can improve decision making by streamlining complex analysis and synthesis processes and facilitating communication and negotiation in the design process. While previous research predominantly focuses on a particular aspect of design knowledge, an integrated method is required to develop such systems especially in the context that the amount of data has become huge. To address such a gap, this work aims to address the two views of design knowledge, namely codification and personalisation. The main idea is to facilitate the collaborative design process with a model-based solution which uses computational methods based on codified knowledge while incorporating rich personal experience of problem-solving for decision-making. This solution requires an effective knowledge representation that facilitates the integration of explicit and tacit knowledge in the computational processes. In addition, it relies on effective system integration during these processes. This paper reports the very first step towards such a solution, describing the system integration issues and the user interaction issues in the development of a prototype system.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has been identified as a critical technology of Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) for protecting computer network systems against cyber-attacks, malware, phishing, damage, or illicit access. AI has potential in strengthening the cyber capabilities and safety of nation-states, local governments, and non-state entities through e-Governance. Existing research provides a mixed association between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity; however, this relationship is believed to be context-specific. AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity influence and are affected by various stakeholders possessing a variety of knowledge and expertise in respective areas. To fill this context specific gap, this study investigates the direct relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, this study examines the mediating role of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity and moderating effect of stakeholders involvement on the relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. The results of PLS-SEM path modeling analysis revealed a partial mediating impact of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity. Likewise, moderating influence of stakeholders involvement was discovered on the relationship between AI and e-Governance, as well as between e-Governance and cybersecurity. It implies that stakeholders involvement has vital significance in AI and e-Governance because all stakeholders have interest in vibrant, transparent, and secured cyberspace while using e-services. This study provides practical implications for governmental bodies of smart cities for strengthening their cybersecurity measures.},

  abstract={Machine learning has been pervasively used in a wide range of applications due to its technical breakthroughs in recent years. It has demonstrated significant success in dealing with various complex problems, and shows capabilities close to humans or even beyond humans. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions. Several suggestions on security evaluations of machine learning systems are also provided. Last, future directions for machine learning security are also presented.},

It changes traditional learning methods by using its Innovative techniques and applications. Using its applications, the teachers may keep track of each student’s development, paying close attention to the areas in which they struggle. Many researchers are working with ML and DL to exploit its discoveries and insights. In education, traditional education methods (TEM) are the same for each student, which means each student is taught in the same way as ML and DL, making this process flexible and creative for solving complex problems and enhancing productivity. Nowadays, each institution adopts E-learning methods as the primary way of learning, especially during the pandemic. Despite this evolution of creativity, delivering quality education, making strategies for analyzing performance and future goals, and career counseling for students still pose challenges. The current study aims to offer a complete overview of the significance of ML approaches in online education. To accomplish this purpose, the study synthesizes information from multiple scientific papers that investigate (a) the methodology used to construct learning analysis tools, (b) the key data resources used, and (c) the scopeÂ of data sources now available. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the research conducted between 1961 and 2022, focusing on various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Its aim is to provide insights into the applications of these techniques and offer optimal solutions to the research questions at hand.

For this purpose, we present a framework that defines the fundamental concepts for applying AI to PM comprising both the requirements of AI for the application domain PM as well as the requirements of PM for the solution domain AI.

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are respected, medical machine learning systems must be developed responsibly. Many high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations—albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations, model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge, the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments.},

  abstract={DevOps is an agile software delivery approach which combines IT development and operation functions into cross-functional teams and promotes team autonomy and automation of processes. Many companies transform their IT departments according to the DevOps paradigm, hoping to increase their pace of software delivery and achieve a tighter collaboration between business and IT functions. Whereas reasons for adopting DevOps are often described in terms of operational efficiency, the paper at hand aims to investigate whether implementing DevOps can additionally contribute to the strategic advantage of companies. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review of 37 empirical research papers on DevOps capabilities and analyzed the results in the context of the dynamic capabilities theory. Our conceptual model proposes that DevOps teams can contribute to firm competitive advantage by building both business- and technology-related capabilities which enable them to sense market opportunities, make fast and targeted decisions and transform their assets in case of changing circumstances. This research aims to generate a deeper understanding of the impact which software delivery approaches like DevOps can have on firm competitive advantage and provides insight into the sources of dynamic capabilities in modern IT organizations.},

  abstract={Technology, and specifically Artificial Intelligence, is transforming society in profound bivalent ways with positive and negative impacts. There is a recognition that AI offers immense potential for improving human well-being, which has been formulated at length from many perspectives, including the economic, social, psychological, developmental, and health perspectives. Critical questions with regards to these AI for well-being systems are, “What does success as far as employing AI to support human well-being look like?” and perhaps more importantly, “How do we inform system development processes to ensure the said success?” AI ethical frameworks and design guidelines have been formulated that address these questions by articulating some notion of successful or desired AI. Further, approaches such as participatory design, value-sensitive design, and goal-oriented requirements engineering aim to connect system development processes with high-level contextual concerns and non-functional softgoals. However, to establish the effectiveness of these instruments for informing AI for well-being solutions, it is necessary to have normative analysis and evaluation frameworks that recognize the innate complexity and multidimensionality of human well-being. This paper presents Herman Dooyeweerd's philosophy as one such framework and provides a formulation of well-being informed by his Theory of Aspects and his “simultaneous realization of norms” principle. The paper then presents a multi-aspectual analysis of AI Ethics frameworks to illustrate and suggest a mechanism that can be employed across diverse contexts and domains for requirement analysis and requirements refinement for technology solutions in general, but specifically for AI for well-being solutions.},

  abstract={This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way.

  abstract={Scenario planning is useful to approach the uncertainty of the future but scenario planning in public policy has gained less attention while public policy requires more realistic future scenarios. This study aims to study what are the roles of scenario planning linking public policy with the future. This study adopted a methodology based on workshop discussion among experts using Korean AI policy case as a case study. The main roles of scenario planning for public policy were exhibited to consider the publicity to approach and resolve public issues, to define the multiple stakeholders and their interests during public policy decisions, to approach time mismatching issues, and to consider cross-border effect between private and public sectors by public policy. The cross-border effect between private and public sectors by technological innovation was uniquely discussed and the theory of scenario planning is extended including the public area in this study.},

  abstract={The benefits of user-centered and participatory design have been widely acknowledged for the development of technologies that are likely to be appropriated by the product&#x2019;s stakeholders. While participatory design has been applied to some affective technologies, the technical and algorithmic complexity of those based on semi-intelligent information filters (SIIFs) pose distinct challenges. Coincidentally, these technologies raise important and distinct ethical issues that make stakeholder input critical during product design. We present a framework for fostering genuine engagement from stakeholders through the case example of biomusic - a SIIF-based affective technology that translates emotion-related physiological changes into sound. During a 3-day workshop, ethnographic methods were used to collect data about the interface between biomusic and individuals on the autism spectrum. From these data, emergent themes, such as such as privacy, data security, conceptions of assistive technology and representation of emotions were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. In order to illuminate distinct design decisions implicated by these complex and interwoven ethical issues, we propose a design framework consisting of a technological, a human-centered and an ecological lens. This framework and recommendations provide a concrete praxis for engaging stakeholders in the complex issues associated with the design of SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems.},

However, adapting AI for EO (AI4EO) solutions to real-world problems in these contexts are not without risks and challenges. In this paper, we discuss the barriers to successful adoption of AI4EO in developing countries and propose a roadmap for more impactful applications of future AI4EO research. The recommendations emerge from three case studies that illustrate the need to create AI4EO systems that take into account technical, social, and ethical considerations specific to the Global South such as data and infrastructural limitations, gaps in technological literacy, geodiversity issues in remote sensing (RS) datasets, and the need for stronger stakeholder engagement, among others. Finally, we propose a framework based on more inclusive, human-centered methodologies rooted in the needs, perspectives, and lived experiences of domain experts, decision-makers, and local communities in the Global South.},

Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse. The goal of our project is to create a mobile phone application that can detect digital dating abuse. To create the user-interface of this application, we are using a participatory design process. This paper describes the first two phases of this process. Focus group sessions were conducted to understand user requirements and generate hand drawn images to get users' visions of the application. Themes generated using thematic analysis concluded that the users wanted an application with an educational component, supported by a detection tool and a resource locator. A digital mockup of the phone app, with the themes generated and images drawn out by the participants, was then created.},

  abstract={In today's world, characterized by the massive generation of data, a major problem related to data manipulation occurs when people's privacy is violated. To face this situation different regulations and solutions, to help users get in control over their data, emerged. However, many of the solutions require a certain level of knowledge in the field of privacy or offer unclear information that does not facilitate a real control of their data by the users. Added to this is the unfriendly user interface design as one of the factors that prevents users from managing their privacy settings effectively. Thus, in this work we explore the effect of the application of Participatory Design (PD) techniques in the implementation of privacy enhancing technologies. In particular, we focus on the use of PD for the design of a privacy dashboard that encourages the immersion of users with privacy issues and gives them greater control with a user interface according to usability criteria. The evaluation of the PD process, which has resulted in a high-fidelity prototype of the dashboard, shows encouraging results and greater user immersion in privacy management.},

  abstract={For varying reasons, our world is experiencing increasing life expectancies and decreasing birth rates, which has led to a generational shift in population distribution. The Government of Canada predicts that in the year 2030, over 9.5 million (23%) Canadians will be 65 years or older. For this growing demographic of older adults, intelligent home health technologies have been proposed as one beneficial avenue to support and maintain an individual’s health and wellness as they begin experiencing aging-related health effects. However, many ethical concerns have been raised regarding the design and deployment of intelligent home healthcare technologies in aging- in-place settings such as long-term care and nursing homes. This paper presents a revised participatory design methodology to identify aging-in-place stakeholders’ ethical concerns with two Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) devices. The main objective of this paper is to develop and test a participatory design research method that is well suited for older adults living in long-term care settings, which is currently lacking. Developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers and social science researchers, this paper presents the participatory method that was designed and tested in a long-term care facility by collaborating with a mix of aging-in-place stakeholders, including older adults and healthcare professionals. By interweaving interactive activities, hand-written tasks, and discussions throughout the data collection process, the methodology successfully identified stakeholders’ ethical concerns with the devices.},

  abstract={The collaborative design is a process that many design groups complete a product development together through the division of labor and the cooperation. These groups are located in different areas, and have different knowledge. They are restricted and affected each other. The way and the evaluation criteria that they consider the development of the products and their knowledge field are different. At the same time, there are dependable relations between the design object and the attribute. Therefore, it is inevitable that there are conflicts in the process of coordination design. These conflicts play an important role in the process, on the one hand the existence of conflicts will result in coordination or breakdown, on the other hand, the conflict will bring a better or a brand-new design, with the solution to a series of conflicts, a better project will be designed. So it has great and positive significance to study the method to solve the conflict of collaborative design.},

  abstract={Object detection remains an active area of research in the field of computer vision, and considerable advances and successes has been achieved in this area through the design of deep convolutional neural networks for tackling object detection. Despite these successes, one of the biggest challenges to widespread deployment of such object detection networks on edge and mobile scenarios is the high computational and memory requirements. As such, there has been growing research interest in the design of efficient deep neural network architectures catered for edge and mobile usage. In this study, we introduce YOLO Nano, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of object detection. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create YOLO Nano, where principled network design prototyping, based on design principles from the YOLO family of single-shot object detection network architectures, is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create a compact network with highly customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task of embedded object detection. The proposed YOLO Nano possesses a model size of ~4.0MB (>15.1× and >8.3× smaller than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) and requires 4.57B operations for inference (>34% and ~17% lower than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) while still achieving an mAP of ~69.1% on the VOC 2007 dataset (~12% and ~10.7% higher than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively). Experiments on inference speed and power efficiency on a Jetson AGX Xavier embedded module at different power budgets further demonstrate the efficacy of YOLO Nano for embedded scenarios.},

  abstract={Over the years, the number of firms measuring and reporting environmental, social, and governance data has seen a massive shift due to the overwhelming demand and pressure from different stakeholders. The introduction of various international regulatory bodies like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), has also been intentional in encouraging companies to disclose publicly documents like annual reports, integrated reports in regards to topics like social, environmental, employee affairs and human rights. When it comes to investing, ESG issues take into account a firm’s operational influence on the native environment. Customers, policy makers, investors, and regulators are exerting huge amount of pressure on Companies to carry out Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") reporting also known as non-financial reporting. Sustainability reporting has previously exhibited numerous advantages to businesses as accurate data collection and reporting are essential for managing the company’s sustainability performance as well as improving financial decision making. It is vital for a company’s long-term performance to actively disclose and communicate its non-financial practices and approaches. Therefore, in order to answer questions like; “Is it vital for developing market firms to disclose non-financial information, such as that relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG)?”, this paper will attempt to provide a deeper insight into ESG disclosure and the impact it has on Firm Performance using Machine Learning techniques (Regression) and performance Ratios (Return On Assets & Return On Equity).},

This article reports on a participatory design process used for the development of an affective technology intended for users on the autism spectrum. We first briefly recapitulate concepts and theories about emotions to illuminate emotion-specific challenges faced in the design process. We then introduce biomusic, an affective technology that communicates emotional states by translating physiological signals into auditory output. The necessity of stakeholder involvement during the development of biomusic is discussed, with a focus specifically on including individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC). Finally, we present a concrete example of a participatory sound design workshop focusing on the development of biomusic's auditory display in collaboration with adolescents with ASC. From this experience, challenges of using participatory design for the development of affective technologies with people with ASC are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence - AI intervention in business has become pervasive across industries, making it invariably essential for human leadership to adapt. AI which might simulate human cognitive behaviour is likely to supplant human leadership. AI may thus redefine the role of leadership in organizations as AI progressively performs new intellectual tasks by replacing human intelligence. While, human limits of domain knowledge and experience restrict decision making, AI with its superior information processing abilities aims at overcoming cognition and complexity. Executives accept that AI will impact workforces as routine and logic based tasks become automated, leading to an increase in demand for EI skills. Even though AI is yet to replace skilled professionals, EI is what machines will remain deprived of. However forging of data, technology and emotional intelligence might be crucial to build an effective decision. HR professionals, policy and decision makers thus intend to leverage potential of AI technologies while seeking ways to offset the negative impacts of AI systems. The study proposes that in this era of technological leap, unprecedented disruption and ambiguous change; effective leadership needs to be redefined. Thus if, business functional domains seek any competitive advantage from AI, they would essentially need it to be coupled with EI.},

The JADE-based autonomous workflow management system (JAWMS) uses a workflow enactment mechanism and an agent integration mechanism. The workflow enactment mechanism is the system kernel and follows the specifications of the workflow reference model. The system kernel supports five agents to manage the workflow and the integration mechanism supports an agent to interact with other platforms and to coordinate and monitor the workflow. JAWMS facilitates integrated circuit design and team interaction in a collaborative but distributed product development environment.},

  pages={10a-10a},
  abstract={The central idea in reference modeling is the reutilization of the business knowledge contained in reference models for the construction of specific information models. The orientation on the technical content of a reference model can increase the efficiency of processes in business engineering projects. Despite this, the use of reference models in the field of business engineering has not established itself in practice. This is due to the particular field of conflict between research and practice, in which reference modeling is at home. Thus, there is still a deficit in knowledge about the use and problems inherent in the implementation of reference models despite the array of theoretical concepts. Accordingly, in the past years the supply-sided development of reference models predominant in the science world has distanced itself from their demand-sided use in business and administration. The article at hand analyses this problem and presents an integrative approach to the computer-aided management of reference models. The task to be mastered using the proposed approach will be conceptually concretized with an framework and prototypically implemented in the form of a reference model management system.},

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in the medical field has demonstrated encouraging potential for enhancing the quality of life of patients who suffer from physical impairments. This comprises the creation of an artificial intelligence agent that is trained in a virtual reality game using a deep reinforcement learning (DQN) algorithm. This will be used as a form of game therapy for children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. The virtual reality game's artificial intelligence can give the child individualized feedback based on their specific skills and how far they've come in the game. As it observes visible growth over time, this can help the child build confidence and self-esteem, which is a win-win situation. This to the enhancement of the child's confidence as well as their general well-being. Multiple studies have shown that artificial intelligence-assisted game therapy is beneficial in enhancing the ability of thinking and overall quality of life of children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. Children who took part in a virtual reality (VR) game treatment programmed using an artificial intelligence (AI) avatar exhibited significant gains in mental ability to think and their confidence level when compared to others. The usage of a virtual reality (VR) game that incorporates an AI agent that has been trained using the DQN algorithm as a form of game therapy for children who suffer from paraplegia has the potential to significantly improve the children's overall quality of life. Researchers should anticipate seeing even more creative uses of virtual reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical and rehabilitation fields as the technology continues to advance.},

  abstract={While deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a large number of complex tasks, it remains a big challenge to deploy such networks for practical, on-device edge scenarios such as on mobile devices, consumer devices, drones, and vehicles. There has been significant recent effort in designing small, low-footprint deep neural networks catered for low-power edge devices, with much of the focus on two extremes: hand-crafting via design principles or fully automated network architecture search. In this study, we take a deeper exploration into a human-machine collaborative design approach for creating highly efficient deep neural networks through a synergy between principled network design prototyping and machine-driven design exploration. The efficacy of human-machine collaborative design is demonstrated through the creation of AttoNets, a family of highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device edge deep learning. Each AttoNet possesses a human-specified network-level macro-architecture comprising of custom modules with unique machine-designed module-level macro-architecture and micro-architecture designs, all driven by human-specified design requirements. Experimental results for the task of object recognition showed that the AttoNets created via human-machine collaborative design has significantly fewer parameters and computational costs than state-of-the-art networks designed for efficiency while achieving noticeably higher accuracy (with the smallest AttoNet achieving ~1.8% higher accuracy while requiring ~10x fewer multiply-add operations and parameters than MobileNet-V1). Furthermore, the efficacy of the AttoNets is demonstrated for the task of instance segmentation and object detection, where an AttoNet-based Mask R-CNN network was constructed with significantly fewer parameters and computational costs (~5x fewer multiply-add operations and ~2x fewer parameters) than a ResNet-50 based Mask R-CNN network.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) for K-12 education has been considered a global initiative. However, evidence of Africa’s inclusion in globalization across schools is lacking in the literature. Besides, resources, including materials and content, are developed across Hong Kong, Japan, Europe, and the USA. These suggest that contextualized resources are effective for AI implementation in schools. Since appropriate pedagogical approaches, sound instructional methods, materials, tools, and activities familiar to the student for instruction lead to effective learning, we embark on a literature survey to unravel the approaches and kind of AI resources utilized across contexts. A systematic literature review methodology was used in this paper to understand the trends of teaching AI at the K-12 educational level. Scientific databases such as IEEE, ACM, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to gather relevant literature in tandem with our research aim. Out of the 451 articles that were retrieved, only 54 fit well into the inclusion criteria and were reviewed for further analysis. This study revealed several existing approaches and resources used to teach AI in schools.},

  abstract={Several policy options exist, or have been proposed, to further responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment. Institutions, including U.S. government agencies, states, professional societies, and private and public sector businesses, are well positioned to implement these policies. However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI technologies or incidents. We recognize that no one policy will lead to responsible AI and instead advocate for strategic policy implementation across institutions.},

  abstract={Individuals who demonstrate well-founded fears of persecution or face real risk of being subjected to torture, are eligible for asylum under Danish law. Decision outcomes, however, are often influenced by the subjective perceptions of the asylum applicant’s credibility. Literature reports on correlations between asylum outcomes and various extra-legal factors. Artificial Intelligence has often been used to uncover such correlations and highlight the predictability of the asylum outcomes. In this work, we employ a dataset of asylum decisions in Denmark to study the variations in recognition rates, on the basis of several application features, such as the applicant’s nationality, identified gender, religion etc. We use Machine Learning classifiers to assess the predictability of the cases’ outcomes on the basis of such features. We find that depending on the classifier, and the considered features, different predictability outcomes arise. We highlight, therefore, the need to take such discrepancies into account, before drawing conclusions with regards to the causes of the outcomes’ predictability.},

  pages={778-791},
  abstract={Building trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, whether in academia or industry, must take into consideration a number of dimensions including legal, social, ethical, public opinion, and environmental aspects. A plethora of guidelines, principles, and toolkits have been published globally, but have seen limited grassroots implementation, especially among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills, and resources. In this article, we report on qualitative SME consultations over two events to establish their understanding of both data and AI ethical principles and to identify the key barriers SMEs face in their adoption of ethical AI approaches. We then use independent experts to review and code 77 published toolkits designed to build and support ethical and responsible AI practices, based on 33 evaluation criteria. The toolkits were evaluated considering their scope to address the identified SME barriers to adoption, human-centric AI principles, AI life cycle stages, and key themes around responsible AI and practical usability. Toolkits were ranked on the basis of criteria coverage and expert intercoder agreement. Results show that there is not a one-size-fits-all toolkit that addresses all criteria suitable for SMEs. Our findings show few exemplars of practical application, little guidance on how to use/apply the toolkits, and very low uptake by SMEs. Our analysis provides a mechanism for SMEs to select their own toolkits based on their current capacity, resources, and ethical awareness levels – focusing initially at the conceptualization stage of the AI life cycle and then extending throughout.},

  abstract={Scholars acknowledge that achieving societal impact should be a key aim of research. However, societal impact usually becomes tangible only long after research completion, so that scholars can hardly report its evidence in a research article, if it is to be published in a timely manner. Interventionist research methods that involve engagement with stakeholders to generate solutions for real-world problem situations can provide a path towards direct societal impact. We argue that achieving such impact requires effective engagement with careful attention to the timing of engagement and inclusiveness of stakeholders – drawing on examples from our own research projects. Our analyses suggest that the research team needs to make choices to structure engagement efforts across research phases spanning problem definition, solution design, and solution evaluation. These choices define a space of possibilities that a research team can navigate based on considerations of access, research setting, research approach, and researcher expertise. We map these to three specific interventionist research approaches: Action Research, Clinical Research, and Action Design Research to highlight the alternatives. The paper concludes by pointing out that interventionist approaches can create favorable conditions but require the judicious exercise of choices by the research team to generate outcomes with direct societal impact.},

Aiming at the problem that semantic information is represented insufficiently when MRs are searched in MG, we propose an ontology-based MR discovery architecture which is based on semantic web technology. Then from the point of view based on semantics and QoS (Quality of Service), the main framework of resource matchmaking is constructed, in which three processes are included: task modeling, resource modeling, semantic modeling and resource matchmaking. On the basis of resource representation model and manufacturing featuresoriented task representation model, combining with the research results of semantic web, some pivotal concepts are defined about the matchmaking resources. Finally, by means of a functional semantic extending method based on the ontology and QoS, the MR matchmaking algorithm is constructed.},

However, it is not often efficient to shorten longer commute times, as it is unable to keep-up with logistics demand during peak hours. Integrative policies, in flow terms, could fill this gap when supported through freight consolidation. Yet, a key issue that emerges in the implementation of consolidation-based transportation systems is that of logistics demand for reducing uncertainties about whether it will be met. The main target of this article is to include demand volatility to carry out a longterm urban land splitting that serve in building consolidation network. To that end, we propose a hybrid machine-learning framework combining several algorithms that are thought robust according to the literature and the achieved accuracy benchmarks.

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In response to the needs of various stakeholders, the FAA has developed an automated tool that provides values for expected next day airport runway configurations and their respective arrival and departure rates. The arrival and departure rates at an airport define the capacity of an airport and as such are a critical piece in determining whether not a capacity/demand imbalance is expected. A forecast of these imbalances facilitates next-day planning and provides to stakeholders transparency regarding potential traffic constraints. The use case that motivated the work described in this paper is to develop various machine-learning (ML) models and compare their performance against the current automated tool, which finds operational periods with similar facility (airport) weather and uses the most frequently occurring runway configuration and rates as the capacity forecast for the next day. Extensive model development across five airports and four years of operational data and forecasted weather showed that the ML models consistently had higher accuracy than the automated tool. Among the ML models, superior options were found, but a single best model across all airports and predictions was not. In a follow-on effort, the authors hope to explore opportunities for working with the user community, incorporate their feedback, and determine if one or more ML models can be used in practice.},

  abstract={While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for many prediction tasks, understanding these models remains a challenge. Despite the recent interest in developing visual tools to help users interpret deep learning models, the complexity and wide variety of models deployed in industry, and the large-scale datasets that they used, pose unique design challenges that are inadequately addressed by existing work. Through participatory design sessions with over 15 researchers and engineers at Facebook, we have developed, deployed, and iteratively improved ActiVis, an interactive visualization system for interpreting large-scale deep learning models and results. By tightly integrating multiple coordinated views, such as a computation graph overview of the model architecture, and a neuron activation view for pattern discovery and comparison, users can explore complex deep neural network models at both the instance-and subset-level. ActiVis has been deployed on Facebook's machine learning platform. We present case studies with Facebook researchers and engineers, and usage scenarios of how ActiVis may work with different models.},

  abstract={Virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI) application in healthcare has shown promise in improving the lives of those with physical limitations. This article describes how an AI agent was created and then taught using the deep reinforcement learning Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) algorithm in a virtual reality game for paraplegic children. Depending on the child's individual skills and development, the AI agent in the Virtual Reality(VR) game may provide them with feedback that is specifically suited. If the child observes actual growth over time, this might help to foster confidence and self-esteem. The AI agent may also provide real-time feedback that is responsive to the child's movements, which will help to improve the child's physical function and all-around wellbeing. Many Research have shown how AI-assisted game therapy can improve the motor skills and general wellbeing of paraplegic youngsters. In one such study, children who participated in a Virtual Reality (VR) gaming therapy created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent showed remarkably greater improvements in balance and gait than those who received conventional physical therapy. In order to improve the quality of life for children with paraplegia, this research aims to use an AI agent that has been trained using the Deep Q-Learning Network(DQN) algorithm in a Virtual Reality (VR) game, that should be anticipate seeing much more varied applications of AI and VR in healthcare and treatment as technology advances.},

We decided to apply it for collaborative and blended design thinking activities in a specialization in human-Computer interaction for master students in computer and data sciences. While being very useful, the original value proposition canvas relies on a business-oriented vocabulary not familiar to science and engineering students. Moreover, its underlying profit-oriented objective makes it difficult to focus on impact and trust-oriented design activities. In this paper, we propose two alternative value proposition canvases, one dedicated to sustainability for development and one to explainability for artificial intelligence. The motivations why and the ways how these alternative canvases were elicited and used in higher education are also discussed.},

  abstract={Complex product development becomes more and more knowledge-intensive. Knowledge integration faces the problems of semantic ambiguity and semantic heterogeneity due to cross-functional teams and multiple cross-domain applications involved in collaborative design environment. To address these problems, this paper presents a mechanism for integrated product modeling with semantic enhancing through ontology technology. Core ontology is constructed to provide a shared semantic foundation. By mapping core ontology according application contexts, application ontologies are built to explicit the application specific semantics. Based on these, core product model containing kernel information of a product and domain models are constructed. To support semantic interoperability, a multi-strategies based semantic reconcile method through core ontology is proposed to discover semantic correspondences between domain ontologies.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Aviation is a conservative field with a focus on deterministic systems that continuously builds on known risks. Currently, available aviation design assurance methods using safety assurance standards are not suited for regulatory assurance of autonomous systems Aviation is facing enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) technology. The challenge for applicants and regulators is to assure system safety of autonomous systems. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions. This paper explores whether the aviation industry can apply those solutions to UAS and UAM assurance. ANSI/UL 4600, Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products, is the first and only publicly available autonomous safety standard. This standard is backed by a certified non-profit standards organization, Underwriters Laboratories. This standard has been recognized as an international American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved standard. The goal-based, technology neutral features of ANSI/UL 4600 make it adaptable to other industries and applications. It assures safety through monitoring safety performance, which enables the desired aviation regulatory approach. It reflects stakeholder views from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who have contemplated the product liability for the design and manufacturing challenges associated with these new technologies. The applicability to the aviation industry can be understood in terms of these features: Goal-Based and Technology Neutral: ANSI/UL 4600 does not require a specific design approach or specific technology. The applicant company must present an auditable and defensible evidence-based safety case. Those central features of safety and auditability follow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance philosophy and could be adapted to aviation. Continued Airworthiness with Monitored Safety Metrics: The FAA's desire to move to performance-based standards with risk-based strategy is supported by ANSI/UL 4600. Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology. Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability. Applicants could design and test appropriate to their technology while regulators can audit and check for safety case completeness. Over time, industry can standardize some portions of testing as the technology matures. Different standards and codified standard approaches could also be independently designed and adapted as technology becomes standardized across the industry. Aviation regulators are already on this path to make performance-based regulations where applicants have the choice of technology and standards that can support innovation. Industry and Public Stakeholder Engagement: The standard has undergone industry and public scrutiny in the automobile segment with considered reviews from technical, legal, and actuarial perspectives. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) have been working to implement a safety case umbrella that encompasses all facets of UAS and UAM development, operation, and maintenance. The safety case umbrella is a systems approach to combine specific UAS and UAM nuances as they relate to current regulatory structure. While the approach affords a performance-based and risk-based oversight of aircraft design and development, production, maintenance and operation, the current regulations were not written to address AI and specifically machine learning. Even when those advanced techniques are not used, small UASs often use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and technology of unknown pedigree could also be assured by the regulators using that approach. The codified approach of ANSI/UL 4600 could be superimposed on the safety case umbrella approach based on current regulations. The exercise of creating an auditable safety case also increases applicant safety awareness and safety culture. For approval of UAS and UAM, this paper recommends a structured and practical framework with an evidence-based safety case, which also takes into consideration the current regulations for applicability to UAS and UAM safety.},

  abstract={In the past century many medical advancements in prosthetics have been achieved, however, discomfort in prosthetic socket remains one of the toughest challenges faced by both amputees and prosthetists. Wearing an uncomfortable socket can lead to users discontinuing use of their socket and subsequently reducing their long-term mobility; negatively impact their psychological health; and prolong rehabilitation. This paper continues the research conducted in earlier publications [1], [2], which introduced the concept of an automated ISO standard robotic testing rig to test a full artificial limb prosthesis (a bio-inspired transfemoral prosthetic socket attached to robotic prosthetic joints and an ankle joint). This paper presents an automated method of designing the bio-inspired socket using artificial intelligence to reduce discomfort and the design time of new or existing full artificial lower limbs using qualitative and quantitative data. The socket will be tested in a gait simulation shown in the figure 7, to safely achieve desirable walking velocities, step length, safety and comfort while consequentially reducing the physical testing on patients and consequentially reduce physical testing on patients.},

  abstract={When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle.

  abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread adoption in healthcare applications and services. The global pandemic has further hastened the integration of AI into telehealth services, such as service quality improvement and new models of care. This paper focuses on the service quality improvement of telehealth, specifically, cancer information and telephone support services, in terms of its human system interaction. We present an AI framework for the detection of patient emotions and emotion transitions based on call recordings of telehealth services. The call recordings are typically a conversation between the caller (patient or carer) and the healthcare practitioner (nurse or counsellor). All primary emotions are expressed across diverse topics during these calls. It is anticipated that the caller emotion state improves during the call due to the information and support received. The proposed AI framework is designed to detect emotions expressed at all stages of the call and based on these expressions, formulate the emotion transition during the call. We have evaluated the proposed AI framework on a large real-world dataset of 60,000 call recordings of cancer information and telephone support services provided by Cancer Council Victoria, Australia. The results confirm the effectiveness of this AI framework in detection of emotions and emotion transitions during the provision of telehealth services.},

In this article, an initial framework to measure the interpretability of HFSs is proposed, combined with a participatory user design process to create a specific instance of the framework for an application context. This approach enables the subjective views of a range of practitioners, experts in the design and creation of FLSs, to be taken into account in shaping the design of a generic framework for measuring interpretability in HFSs. This design process and framework are demonstrated through two classification application examples, showing the ability of the resulting index to appropriately capture interpretability as perceived by system design experts.},

  abstract={Serious mental illness (SMI) is a leading disability worldwide. Partnering with people with SMI to co-produce smartphone apps to support mental health outcomes throughout the software development lifecycle may support patient engagement with smartphone health app interventions. Partnering with this community is often challenging and requires a highly specialized community engagement training and skillset. The purpose of this study was to identify stakeholders' perspectives on partnering to inform the software development lifecycle of a smartphone health app intervention for people with SMI. We conducted thirty-five semi-structured qualitative interviews with 20 mental health patients and 15 peer support specialists. We identified six themes: (1) co-produce health app intervention content; (2) selection of app technology features; (3) integration of human factors in digital health apps; (4) consideration of personalized patient preferences in digital health apps; (5) identify unrecognized concerns early in the software development lifecycle; and (6) inclusion of real-world social, cognitive, and environmental contexts. Integration of these considerations may elucidate the partnering process to facilitate engagement among vulnerable populations that commonly disengage from mental health smartphone apps use such as people with SMI.},

This aspect becomes even more relevant when dealing with sensitive services and issues such as those related to interaction with specific subgroups of any population. Over the years, there have been few successes in integrating and proposing technologies related to deafness and sign language. Instead, in this paper, we propose an account of successful interaction between a signatory robot and the Italian deaf community, which occurred during the Smart City Robotics Challenge (SciRoc) 2021 competition1. Thanks to the use of a participatory design and the involvement of experts belonging to the deaf community from the early stages of the project, it was possible to create a technology that has achieved significant results in terms of acceptance by the community itself and could lead to significant results in the technology development as well.},

The resulting structure of created ontologies is described together with generic process models that enable a semantic composition and orchestration of electronic services in the analyzed courses. Added semantics allows a flexible integration of educational services and processes, which consequently may help educators to minimize their efforts when preparing and running new instances of courses or lectures, as well as to effectively analyze the students' performance and the teaching process as whole.},

The machine teaching paradigm instead shifts the focus from machine learning experts towards the domain experts and users of machine learning technology. This shift opens up for new perspectives on the current use of machine learning as well as new usage areas to explore. In this study, we apply and map existing machine teaching principles onto a contextual machine teaching implementation in a commuting setting. The aim is to highlight areas in machine teaching theory that requires more attention. The main contribution of this work is an increased focus on available features, the features space and the potential to transfer some of the domain expert's explanatory powers to the machine learning system.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer, and it has a dismal prognosis. It represents about 30 % (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year. As a result, there is a pressing need to create efficient and quick computational approaches for breast cancer prognosis. In this study, a multimodal deep learning model that enables decision-making on data from multiple data sources is proposed and used with three different classifiers. We achieved 82% accuracy in decision trees, 90% in random forests and 88% in support vector machines. We have seen that the results we get from the combined data are more successful than the distinct convolutional neural network models we have run separately before. Combining diverse data sources for the successful application of multimodal deep learning algorithms appears to be an effective strategy to improve human breast cancer prediction performance.},

We present the DelphAI framework as an example of a practical human-centered approach to ML-based time-series forecasting for applications where end-users have little familiarity with ML techniques. The proposed socio-technical methodology incorporates essential domain knowledge through stakeholder participation into the development of predictive models.

  abstract={Software effort estimation is a necessary component of software development projects that belong to industrial software systems and digital transformation initiatives. Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technology into various components of a company or organization in order to improve operations, procedures, customer experiences, and overall performance. Industrial software systems are trained software packages designed for use in industrial and manufacturing processes. The paper deals with the machine learning based effort estimation in order to create an effective and robust model for predicting effort. The paper proposes an Omni-Ensemble Learning (OEL) approach, which is a combination of static ensemble selection along with genetic algorithm and dynamic ensemble selection. The paper identifies the impact of software effort estimation in industrial software system, and works on the these attributes to implement a robust ensemble model. The proposed Omni-Ensemble Selection (OES) provides better overall performance (in terms of evaluation metrics) and on comparing with multiple machine learning models over Finnish and Maxwell datasets.},

  abstract={Traditionally both Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Human Factors disciplines have tended to utilise their own methods and tools in order to achieve the design of Human-Machine Teams (HMT), with little interaction between the two approaches. However, in order to address both human and machine both disciplines can bring the design team together. In this paper we propose a shared co-design approach for HMT that facilitates a better understanding of system requirements and user interaction. By focusing on context rich scenarios and asking end users to walk through decisions they would make using the system it is possible for both AI and HF team members to obtain critical design information for the HMT. System intent and transparency are essential components within the HMT paradigm, and thus play a central role within the design team. This is particularly relevant when multiple AIs are involved in a decision that is then mediated by the machine. In such instances, the human component is a fundamental component and will often be required to approve or maintain awareness of the decision being generated. This is discussed using examples of user interface design and how the human can be embraced within such AI mediations.},

  abstract={Staff engagement in the work environment is vital to organizational success. Engaged staff are motivated and indulged in their work as they have a sense of belonging, commitment, and loyalty toward their employer, which eventually leads to better performance and outcomes. While various organizational factors are related to staff engagement, limited research is available regarding what drives staff engagement and the degree of their importance in healthcare. Leveraging data-driven approaches, in this article, we employ three machine learning algorithms, random forests, gradient boosting, and extra trees, to identify the relative importance of organizational factors affecting staff engagement. We use hospital-level aggregate survey data from hospitals in the U.K. While staff engagement is the outcome variable, the following factors are used as organizational factors in the prediction model and feature importance analysis: equality, diversity, and inclusion, safety culture, health and wellbeing, immediate managers, quality of appraisals, quality of care, bullying and harassment, violence, and team working. All the algorithms provide comparable prediction results with similar feature importance ranking with respect to prediction accuracy. The results suggest that safety culture is the most influential factor related to staff engagement, followed by the team working. Healthcare managers and decision makers can benefit from this data-driven application to make informed decisions in resource allocation and prioritization efforts to improve staff engagement.},

  abstract={As AI algorithms become increasingly integrated into social media platforms, concerns regarding their ethical implications have grown. This research paper examines the ethical use of AI in social media, focusing on three key areas: content moderation, user manipulation, and the spread of misinformation. We analyze the ethical concerns arising from personal, political, social, and ethical biases embedded within AI algorithms. The paper highlights the challenges of striking a balance between human moderation and algorithmic enforcement, as well as the need to address biases in the decision-making process. We delve into the complexities of content moderation, including the unintended consequences of algorithmic enforcement and the ethical debates surrounding content removal. The paper also explores user manipulation tactics employed in social media and the ethical considerations necessary to protect and empower users against manipulation. Furthermore, we examine AI's role in spreading misinformation and the ethical challenges of detecting and combatting false information while avoiding unintended amplification. To address these ethical concerns, we discuss potential solutions such as enhancing transparency, promoting fairness, and empowering users with control over their AI -driven experiences. Additionally, we present case studies and examples to provide practical insights into the complex ethical landscape of AI in social media. The research paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in AI usage and suggesting future directions for research, collaboration, policy development, and responsible innovation.

  abstract={The use of data analytics and Machine Learning (ML) branches of AI for predictive and analytic knowledge retrieval has surged significantly in various industries (e.g., health, finance, business, and manufacturing). However, the acceptance of AI has been hindered by opaque models that lack transparency. Explainability in AI (XAI) has gained significant prominence owing to its focus on introducing avenues of accountability in AI. XAI acknowledges the importance of human factors and strives to incorporate them into the design process, recognising that the cognitive effort involved in understanding explanations is a key aspect. Mental Models play a crucial role in the XAI evaluative premise, but their current utility is limited. By intentionally designing explanations that align with users’ mental models, their experiences can be significantly enhanced, leading to improved understanding, satisfaction, trust, and performance. This study proposes using Mental Models to elicit explainability requirements and to develop an Ontology-Driven Conceptual Model to facilitate the learning process for a better understanding of explanations.},

  abstract={Development and Operations (DevOps), a particular type of Continuous Software Engineering, has become a popular Software System Engineering paradigm. Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.},

  abstract={This paper discusses principles and practices that can optimize artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching and learning from the perspectives of leading organizational change and by reimaging learning activities with AI as a collaborative partner. Based on the Kowch's participatory teaching and learning (PTL) principles for networked organizations, the authors analyze the integration of new talent patterns emerging in more agile interdisciplinary education systems connected through information and technologies, and propose principles for collaboration through machines as AI participants and principles for designing new education systems where the teams with AI can thrive. Taking a different angle from the traditional linear education system design tasks and education institution redesigns, the proposed principles assume more time for education and training leaders to take stronger leadership roles in the creation of better teams with AI augmentation. We offer principles for designing education institutions that are capable of adapting with these innovations and we also offer principles for designing these next generation learning environments. Finally by "zooming in" on instruction and AI, we use Activity theory to imagine better inclusions of social and cultural components with AI as an important, emerging, and unscripted new partner.},

  abstract={Majority of the rural population in India rely on agriculture as their major source of income. Due to the unforeseen circumstances and changes pertinent to season, demographics, geopolitical, etc., growth in the agricultural sector has been very constrained, thus keeping the majority below the poverty line. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or MGNREGA, is an Indian labor law that strives to guarantee the ‘right to work. It is a social security measure with a goal to improve livelihood of the adults in the rural areas by providing at least 100 days of unskilled labor work. However, its efficiency is hampered by the inability to accurately track the work on a regular basis. Absence of third-party contractors may be financially beneficial, but it is causing a growing discontentment within the rural households. This paper summarizes two years of rigorous field work and articulates field experience and challenges with the MGNREGA scheme implementation in Dunda village, located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India. The systemic and contextual causes are explored while our stay with the rural community and studied using participatory and user centric methods. This paper presents and proposes a viable solution developed using collaborative approach with the rural workers and village officials in-charge of the scheme's implementation. A wearable smart device to monitor the on-field activity of workers is proposed. A centralized worker report database to record workdays generated by each worker and task details is also proposed. Further, details about task progress and worker compensation can be regulated. It is expected that this sort of activity tracking device will improve the transparency of the process and restore confidence in the MGNREGA scheme at the grassroots.},

  abstract={Visual Analytics (VA) is a process to facilitate the uncovering of knowledge from large and complex datasets to enable users to make informed decisions. However, the design of VA tools is frequently performed by multidisciplinary teams that can be physically in the same place or distributed across different locations. Therefore, there is an intrinsic collaboration need between team members and also of proposing methods to support these teams to work collaboratively during the design and implementation of VA systems. Although some proposals have made on the use of visual data flows and recommender systems, its combination with a Multi-Device Environment can benefit the discussion and exchange of knowledge during design and programming. Therefore, this article presents the design of an architecture that combines a Multi-Device Environment (MDE) with visual data flows and recommender systems for the design of VA tools in a collaborative way. The intention is to support designers and programmers during the design of visual data flows through the sharing and analysis of ideas in a collaborative environment supported by a recommender system that aids decision making during the design of flows.},

  abstract={This paper surveys the recent developments and future research opportunities in computer supported cooperative work in design. This domain of interest has been variously conceptualized and described in different publications. There is a broader interpretation that considers the entirety of product lifecycle as a target domain and aims at a holistic optimization of all related engineering processes by connecting them through design. There exists a narrower interpretation that concentrates on the enhancement of the product conceptualization and creative design activities in distributed, multidisciplinary and volatile environments. The former is most frequently referred to as collaborative engineering and the latter as collaborative design. The paper concentrates on collaborative design and investigates the concepts, advancements and issues from: (i) philosophical and theoretical, (ii) technological and infrastructural, (iii) organizational and methodological, (iv) social and cultural, (v) cognitive and behavioral perspectives. Based on literature sources and the own work of the author in the last three decades, it provides a broadly-based analysis of the related concepts, knowledge, means, systems and concerns in current research, development and application with the objective to point towards future progression opportunities. The paper identifies a gradual shift in the research interest from the technological and procedural aspects to the socio-cultural, inter-personal and informational aspects. It proposes that collaborative design is eventually about people and that mobile, ubiquitous and smart technologies create many new opportunities for conducting collaborative design. Semantics, pragmatics and apobetics of inter-personal interaction and communication play a key role in the success of collaborative design.},

We show that the reality is more nuanced; machine learning can be expected to induce types of bias not found in the training data. In particular, if different groups have different optimal models, and the optimal model for one group has higher accuracy, the optimal accuracy joint model will induce disparate impact even when the training data does not display disparate impact. We argue that due to systemic bias, this is a likely situation, and simply ensuring training data appears unbiased is insufficient to ensure fair machine learning.},

  abstract={In contemporary agriculture, protecting ripening fruit crops is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity and preventing economic losses. This study presents an intelligent, Edge Computing-based acoustic bird repellent system developed to deter birds from damaging ripening fruits in orchards. The system is equipped with microphone sensors to detect bird vocalizations and audible alarms utilized to scare off the birds. Machine learning algorithms analyze the collected audio data to identify bird sounds in real-time and generate effective bird repellent noises accordingly. This Edge Computing solution minimizes data transmission latency and network load, providing rapid and efficient protection. The system can be tailored to different bird species and optimized according to specific conditions within the orchard. Experimental tests conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed acoustic bird repellent system is successful in safeguarding fruit crops and significantly mitigating the detrimental impact of birds. In conclusion, the Edge Computingbased acoustic bird repellent system offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution in the agricultural domain, assisting in the prevention of yield loss in orchards and enhancing economic benefits.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The reviving of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is changing our lives due to the superior performance in computer vision, nature language processing, and decision making and control tasks. Recently, computing in memristor (CIM) technology is considered as an unconventional approach to meet the urgent needs of high computing efficiency and throughput in continuously developing AI applications. In contrast to von Neumann architecture, computing in memristor technology avoids the data movement between computing units (such as CPU and GPU) and memory unit which would greatly reduce computing latency and power consumption. Memristor is one kind of novel non-volatile memory devices which could not only store information with multi-bit, but also conduct core computing operations of AI algorithm. Assembling memristors in a crossbar structure, it could carry out in-situ parallel multiply-accumulation (MAC) computation. To make the best use of the memristors in neuromorphic systems, a memristor-friendly architecture and the software-hardware collaborative design methods are essential, and the key challenge is how to utilize the memristor’s analog behavior. The talk will discuss recent development of analog computing in memory technology from device engineering, circuit design and architecture optimization perspectives. Further, the system and technology co-optimization (STCO) method is proposed to fully unleash the potential of CIM for practical applications.},

However, ChatGPT's security system can be circumvented or deceived to generate malicious content. Moreover, these AI enabled tools to have design issues, e.g., accuracy issues. As a result, ChatGPT can be accused of violating the confidentiality of information (privacy invasion), producing inaccurate information, and potentially facilitating attack tool generation that can compromise the availability principle of the CIA triad. This paper presents ChatGPT as a threat against the CIA triad principle by focusing on violating these principles.},

Also, the psychophysiological correlates of users' trust from users” eletrodermal activity responses. Eighteen (18) carefully selected participants embark on a hypothetical trip playing an autonomous vehicle driving game. In order to stay safe, throughout the drive experience under four risk conditions (very high risk, high risk, low risk and no risk) that are based on automotive safety and integrity levels (ASIL D, C, B, A), participants exhibit either high or low trust by evaluating the AVs' to be highly or less trustworthy and consequently relying on the Artificial intelligence or the joystick to control the vehicle. The result of the experiment shows that there is significant increase in users' trust and user's delegation of controls to AVs' as risk decreases and vice-versa. In addition, there was a significant difference between user's initial trust before and after interacting with AVs' under varying risk conditions. Finally, there was a significant correlation in users' psychophysiological responses (electrodermal activity) when exhibiting higher and lower trust levels towards AVs'. The implications of these results and future research opportunities are discussed.},

  abstract={Improving analysis of market basket data requires the development of approaches that lead to recommendation systems that are tailored to specifically benefit grocery chain. The main purpose of that is to find relationships existing among the sales of the products that can help retailer identify new opportunities for cross-selling their products to customers. This paper aims to discover knowledge patterns hidden in large data set that can yield more understanding to the data holders and identify new opportunities for imperative tasks including strategic planning and decision making. This paper delivers a strategy for the implementation of a systematic analysis framework built on the established principles used in data mining and machine learning. The primary goal of that is to form the foundation of what we envisage will be a new recommendation system in the market. Uniquely, our strategy seeks to implement data mining tools that will allow the analyst to interact with the data and address business questions such as promotions advertisement. We employ Apriori algorithm and support vector machine to implement our recommendation systems. Experiments are done using a real market dataset and the 0.632+ bootstrap method is used here in order to evaluate our framework. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework will be able to generate benefits for grocery chain using a real-world grocery store data.},

  abstract={The reverse design of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) using AI has received significant attention in recent years. To quickly optimize the fundamental optical properties of PCFs and obtain the optimal design combination, researchers have favored machine learning algorithms. However, relying solely on the knowledge provided by a few experts has limited the versatility and performance of these models. To address these issues, we propose a collaborative PCF property optimization framework as a new paradigm for reverse design. This framework allows experts from different institutions to share their design knowledge and collaboratively optimize the fundamental optical properties of PCFs without direct data interaction. Additionally, this framework can adapt to low-resourced computing devices that only use a small dataset without any data augmentation methods to achieve excellent optimization performance. Our proposed framework provides a novel and practical platform for global collaboration among research institutions for the reverse design of micro-structured fibers.},

  abstract={This paper conducts a study of input-sensitivity in collaborative graph algorithms for CPU-GPU systems with support for Unified Memory. The study, conducted on an extensive set of real-world graphs from the Koblenz Network, identifies three main sources of performance inefficiencies that are influenced by characteristics of the input graph. We develop autotuning methods to specifically address these inefficiencies. We then explore machine learning approaches to characterize the relationship between input graph properties, performance, and optimization parameters. In applying our learned models to a test dataset of 70 real-world graphs on the problems of breadth-first search (BFS) and single-source shortest path (SSSP), we are able to attain 96.33% of the peak performance on BFS, and 99.40% on SSSP when using the top-3 predictions of a neural network. We also attain 95.63% of the peak performance on BFS when using three decision trees trained on different categories of graphs. The performance of the learned models is superior to selecting the most frequent optimal configuration, indicating that the machine learning models were able to successfully correlate our selected configuration parameters with graph attributes.},

Yet successful diagnosis requires high-level expertise that practitioners lack. As in many complex data-oriented domains, visualization could help. This two-phase study explored the design of visualizations to aid ML diagnosis. In phase 1, twelve ML practitioners were asked to diagnose a model using ten state-of-the-art visualizations; seven design themes were identified. In phase 2, several design themes were embodied in an interactive visualization. The visualization was used to engage practitioners in a participatory design exercise that explored how they would carry out multi-step diagnosis using the visualization. Our findings provide design implications for tools that better support ML diagnosis by non-expert practitioners.},

  abstract={The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought forward new digital tools that have had a wide impact across society. However, AI digital tools (such as ChatGPT, midjourney, DALL-E 2) have brought forward legal and ethical concerns. — Internationally, public, and private leaders are introducing regulatory frameworks to address data governance for such these AI digital tools (i.e., Global Data Protection Regulation, the European AI Act, Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, NIST Risk Management Framework, etc.). We recognize that these AI digital tools are a vital aspect of future technological development, but they require input from various sectors in addressing ethics and compliance design. We survey the current landscape of published AI-specific regulatory frameworks and known engineering design process methods. Using a product lifecycle approach, we also introduce a trans-disciplinary framework to address AI ethics and compliance via design. This product lifecycle approach considers several principles: a Human-Centered Design for Risk Assessment, Functional Safety and Risk Management Standardization, and Continuous Governance throughout Product Lifecycle. Establishing risk management throughout AI product lifecycles can ensure accountability for AI product use cases. In addition, by utilizing previous Functional Safety considerations we can create safety mechanisms throughout the product lifecycle of AI digital tools. Finally, establishing in-field testing for continuous governance will enable the flexibility for new compliance standards and transparency. We establish this governance framework to aid in new compliance strategies for these emerging issues with AI digital tools.},

  abstract={Polynomial multiplication is widely used in communication, signal and image processing. In practical application, the system often needs to process a large amount of data efficiently and then output the results. However, since polynomials are always multivariable and large-scale, software algorithms alone are not effective to meet the actual requestments. In addition, the key to polynomial multiplication is the operation of matrix multiplication. Nevertheless, due to the increasingly complex structure of matrix multiplication, it is challenging to realize efficient processing and calculation of large matrices. With the development of FPGA, LSI manufacturing, memory interface and EDA tools, it is possible to apply hardware to the polynomial multiplication. To solve the above problems, we have designed and implemented a polynomial multiplication platform based on FPGA, which combines hardware and software to make up for the shortcomings of current software algorithms and at the same time, it can efficiently and effectively operate polynomial multiplication.},

  abstract={In today’s world, digital platforms such as social media have become one of the most influential media sources. This may give an impact on company reputation due to massive user-generated content. However, due to its vast volume and unstructured nature, manual classification of these digital contents is difficult. Previous studies, evaluate corporate reputation using machine learning-focused mostly on positive, neutral, and negative aspects and lacking the multidimensional nature of corporate reputation. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore the integration of the domain ontology approach with machine learning approaches to achieve multi-dimensional classification for online corporate reputation. Overall research route to measure corporate reputation in social media is discussed. The proposed research route starts from retrieving corporate content from digital media for selected domain, next preprocessing data before topics and bag-of-words generated from the extracted data and mapping according to corporate reputation dimensions. The proposed approach is expected to produce a framework for an online corporate reputation that can be used across multiple business domains.},

  abstract={Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe the challenges involved in automating collaborative negotiations and propose solution idea that can reduce computational cost of deal identification. We consider negotiations over a matter that has multiple issues and each issue can take any one of the multiple possible values for that issue. Two challenges are discussed in detail. The first one is the difficulty of assigning utility value ( i.e. evaluating) each possible contract in large contract spaces. The second is the computational complexity of locating the optimal contract. Previous work proposed grouping contracts to avoid evaluating each contract and a mediated bidding based deal identification algorithm to reduce the search for the optimal contract. However, the computational cost of exhaustively matching bids from agents grows exponentially with the number of agents and bids. We propose a rule that can be used during grouping of contracts (defining constraints) that reduces the number of possible bids from agents and hence increases the number of agents that could participate in the negotiation. We assume that each constraint corresponds to one evaluation criterion. The rule states that when evaluating contracts by a criterion, only contracts that satisfied previous contracts are considered.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are having a great impact on all aspects of society. However, due to the technical competencies and mathematical understanding required for implementing solutions leveraging these technologies, access to the communities working on these technologies is limited to those having these skills. This limits the ability of domain experts to directly transfer their knowledge and contribute to the development of AI and ML systems. To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example.},

Although the term Q4.0 was introduced with the fourth industrial revolution, its use and understanding are still unclear and not widespread. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis on the topic has been carried out followed by a more general overview of literature on the impact of digitalization on Quality Management. The literature findings along with the empirical experience of the authors led to the development of a comprehensive framework depicting the challenges of different nature faced during the adoption of a Q4.0 approach from the initial awareness of the topic, till the implementation phase. After its empirical validation, the framework can be used as a basis to develop an implementation framework of Q4.0.},

To implement the approach we plan to use OMAS, a platform for developing multi-agent systems. OMAS has features for describing multi-lingual ontologies and multi-lingual representations of dialogs. It also provides a platform for testing multi-cultural cooperation over the Internet. Some experimental applications are being developed currently using different natural languages. In this paper, we propose an agent-based support system for requirement specification definition as one such application. The proposed system is a web-based and agent-based application and supports a multi-lingual software design team using a network of personal design assistant agents.},

The group was composed of experts with same background, who work in different locations of the same company. Even though they apparently share similar analysis methods, during meetings discrepancies emerged. Different points of view were argued and decisions were made at the end of each meeting. Given the final product acceptance problems, we look back at each meeting and attempt to identify the reasons that led to this unfortunate and common outcome. Understanding the problem enables us to draw a set of guidelines for empowering design meetings with simple technologic methods for improving group final artifact acceptance; therefore diminishing re-work. Our observations point towards (1) a correlation between designers' behavior and future artifact acceptance; (2) a set of actions that interrupts or brings back group attention; and (3) a metric for evaluating group design meetings. We believe our findings may guide software developers to tools for supporting group design.},

  abstract={Collaborative new product development is a common practice in most of the companies to maintain their competitiveness in global competition. Case-based reasoning system can provide the most similar cases for the new product development project to shorten the time-to-market of new product. However, most of the CBRS are limited to the cases created within the company. It would be very difficult to access information about collaborative partners before the collaborating project started. Therefore, sharing of product cases between collaborating partners becomes a research issue. This paper makes sharing of design cases between partners become easier by utilizing the ontology alignment technology to integrate the case-based reasoning systems of the collaborating partners. The case library structure of collaborating partner is merged with main CBRS through the merge of ontology of the library.},

The paper presents methods and tools for distributed tools integration based on a markup language (XML) which supports universal description of tools, straightforward storage, search and retrieval of tool descriptions, as well as remote invocation of tools, and in consequence realization of distributed design tasks. Sequences of design tasks are graphically represented as workflows. Presented concepts and methods have been verified with the design environment based on Tools Registration and Management Services (TRMS). The TRMS-based environment comprises among others a tool for tracking changes in specification of a design tool which is available in a network.

  abstract={While projects, developments and applications addressing and using artificial intelligence (AI) are rather multifaceted and their number is constantly increasing, the standardisation activities in the field of artificial intelligence are limited, their number is significantly lower and does not increase at the same pace. The European funded project StandICT.eu aims at supporting European experts' presence in and contributions to international standardisation activities in ICT. The focus of the project is on the 5 priority domains identified by the European Commission (Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data, Cyber Security, 5G) and on Artificial Intelligence while being open for other relevant topics defined in the annual European Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation. The project has two main outcomes: (i) increased contribution of European experts in international standardisation through support by providing grants for planned contributions of successful applications of experts, and (ii) an online observatory of published standards and ongoing standardisation activities in the areas mentioned before. This observatory (called Standards Watch) is accessible through the project's web site and open for contributions and comments from registered users. As part of the effort for the Standards Watch the projects has prepared a comprehensive analysis of the international standardisation landscape in the AI field, that comprises a description of the ICT standards and ongoing work at international level in the field of AI across the standardisation organisations already active in the field. In this article we will present results of our work where we have analysed the work of the 5 international and European Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) IEEE,11Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [13]. ISO/IEC,22International Organization for Standardization [15]/International Electrotechnical Com mission [12]. ITU-T,33International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector [16]. ETSI44European Telecommunications Standards Institute [10]. and CEN-CENELEC55European Committee for Standardization [7]-European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization [8]. developing standards in the field of AI. The first 4 bodies have already been active several years in AI standardisation at the time of writing this article. CEN-CENELEC has launched a focus group in 2019 which aims at producing a roadmap for AI standardisation. For these 4 SDOs information on their active groups, details of their work and the respective state/outcome is provided in the main part of this article. Followed by the same exercise for the two identified Standards Settings Organisations (SSOs): W3C66World Wide Web Consortium [20]. and IRTF,77Internet Research Task Force [14]. their active groups and the respective state/outcome. With this information an initial analysis of the AI standardisation landscape as Q3 2019 is performed with the main outcomes that (i) the number of working groups chaired by Europeans is significant and (ii) that there is room for European experts contributing to ongoing and future standardisation work. The article is concluded by considerations on future priorities.},

  abstract={Indefinite semantic conflict of words is another category of the problem of semantic consistency of words, besides definite semantic conflict of words. While the definite cases are well solved in our previous work, there are still no effective solutions to the indefinite semantic conflicts of words, which involve a much more complicated process of semantic discrimination. Based on WordNet and our ontology description language FLoDL, we propose a document type based word frequency accumulation algorithm to solve the problems. This algorithm is carried out in two phases based on different document types: a training phase and a discrimination phase. The discrimination phase is mainly based on the words' frequency information collected in the training process. Finally, through some detailed experiments, a compared analysis is given to show that our algorithm has a far better performance than other previous solutions, thus improves the overall performance collaborative editing},

We propose an awareness ontology that conceptualizes the most important aspects of awareness in such systems and can be used to automatize the development of their user interfaces. In order to validate the usefulness of this ontology, we have related the concepts included in our ontology to the awareness dimensions exposed in a well-known awareness framework.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) leverages distributed and non-dedicated sensing concepts by utilizing sensors embedded in a large number of mobile smart devices. However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume resources from any number of participants’ devices; as well as attempting to clog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection devices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a machine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore, the aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect to misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach where the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection performance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher performance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100% detection accuracy using small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel architecture for collaborative multi-agent functional modeling in design on the semantic Web. The proposed architecture is composed of two visiting levels, i.e., local level and global level. The local level is an ontology-based functional modeling framework, which uses Web ontology language (OWL) to build a domain-specific local functional design ontology repository. Using this local ontology repository, the requests coming from the functional design agent can be parsed and performed effectively. The global level is a distributed multi-agent collaborative virtual environment, in which, OWL is used as a content language within the standard FIPA agent communication language (FIPA ACL) messages for describing ontologies, enabling diverse functional design ontologies between different agents to be communicated freely. The proposed architecture facilitates the exchange between diverse knowledge representation schemes in different functional modeling environments, and supports computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) between multiple functional design agents},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={With the increasing complexity of engineering design objects, online collaborative design is considered to be a way to solve complex design problems by using multidisciplinary teams and parallel work. However, the coexistence of collaboration and competition among interdisciplinary teams, the coexistence of the consistency of the overall design goals and the heterogeneity of individual knowledge, causes frequent conflicts in the design process. The traditional integrated conflict resolution strategy adopts the corresponding conflict resolution strategy to solve the conflicts in order based on the conflict classification. Essentially, conflict resolution is regarded as a static resolution process, which is a repetitive work of "detecting conflicts and resolving conflicts". This article defines the concept of conflict degree by integrating the three dimensions of conflict subject contradiction degree, conflict object complexity and conflict problem impact degree, and links conflict with the collaborative design process, and regards the conflict process as a dynamic development process with the design process. On this basis, for conflicts with a high degree of conflict, the strategy of direct activation assisted negotiation is adopted to shorten the conflict resolution cycle and improve the quality of conflict resolution. Based on the modeling and calculation method of conflict degree, the negotiation process is explained.},

  abstract={Ontologies that explicitly identify objects, properties, and relationships in specific domains are essential for collaborations that involve sharing of data, knowledge, or resources among autonomous individuals. Against this background, this paper motivates the need for collaborative environments for ontology construction, sharing, and usage; identifies the desiderata of such environments; and proposes package based description logics (P-DL) that extend classic description logic (DL) based ontology languages to support modularity and (selective) knowledge hiding. In P-DL, each ontology consists of packages (or modules) with well-defined interfaces. Each package encapsulates a closely related set of terms and relations between terms. Together, these terms and relations represent the ontological commitments about a small, coherent part of the universe of discourse. Packages can be hierarchically nested, thereby imposing an organizational structure on the ontology. Package-based ontologies also allow creators of packages to exert control over the visibility of each term or relation within the package thereby allowing the selective sharing (or conversely, hiding) of ontological commitments captured by a package.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1295-1300},
  abstract={Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a challenging problem with important real-world applications. Recent efforts attempting to exploit powerful representations by deep neural networks (DNN) are hindered by the lack of subjectively annotated data. This paper presents a novel BIQA method which overcomes this fundamental obstacle. Specifically, we design a pair of collaborative autoencoders (COAE) consisting of a content autoencoder (CAE) and a distortion autoencoder (DAE) that work together to extract content and distortion representations, which are shown to be highly descriptive of image quality. While the CAE follows a standard codec procedure, we introduce the CAE-encoded feature as an extra input to the DAE's decoder for reconstructing distorted images, thus effectively forcing DAE's encoder to extract distortion representations. The self-supervised learning framework allows the COAE including two feature extractors to be trained by almost unlimited amount of data, thus leaving limited samples with annotations to finetune a BIQA model. We will show that the proposed BIQA method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has superior generalization capability over other learning based models. All the related codes, trained models, and the supplementary material are available at: https://github.com/Macro-Zhou/NRIQA-VISOR/.},

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a belief representation method of designing a mental model based on Design Rationale. First, through the logic narration of designers, on the basis of the DR model, the knowledge semantic network is constructed based on the Bayesian Network. Then, the causality in the Bayesian Network is obtained by means of node conversion. Finally, the belief in designing mental models is calculated by reusing the design rationality for parameter learning. An example of cantilever beam structure design is used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Yet, we argue this is fundamentally misguided because these definitions are imperfect, siloed constructions of the human values they hope to proxy, while giving the guise that those values are sufficiently embedded in our technologies. Under popularized methods, tensions arise when practitioners attempt to achieve each pillar of fairness, privacy, and transparency in isolation or simultaneously. In this position paper, we push for redirection. We argue that the AI community needs to consider all the consequences of choosing certain formulations of these pillars-not just the technical incompatibilities, but also the effects within the context of deployment. We point towards sociotechnical research for frameworks for the latter, but push for broader efforts into implementing these in practice.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to exploit stakeholder information for constructing stake-based social networks. We devise three types of networks: StakeNet (a company-person network), StakeCompanyNet (a company-company network), and StakePersonNet (a person-person network). We also present a visualization tool to display socio-centric and ego-centric views of the networks. Furthermore, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of the StakeNet, and the results reveal that most of StakeNet's characteristics are similar to those of a typical social network, excluding that the in-degree does not follow a power law distribution. Finally, we show two applications of StakeNet by utilizing it to discover influential companies and business groups. The experiments suggest that our outcomes are highly consistent with the results generated by human experts.},

  abstract={To achieve the minimal latency, proactive wireless communication has been proposed to facilitate proactive mobile networks. Due to lacking closed-loop control, random selection of radio resource units (RRUs) serves the only way to the critical radio resource allocation (RRA), which inevitably suffers collisions of simultaneous utilizing the same RRUs to result in loss of packets, particularly in the uplink. Macroscopic view on the uplink and downlink network operation cycle insightfully suggests that it is still possible to construct a delayed version of semi-closed-loop operation to predictively utilize radio resource in the uplink of proactive mobile network. A two-stage reinforcement learning mechanism to enable the recommendation of radio resource utilization from network infrastructure to mobile smart machines is proposed, which consists of the multi-armed bandit scheme for RRA and the neural network to learn historical utilization of RRUs. Simulations verify machine learning enables smart and predictive RRA with superior performance that can lead to the minimal latency of mobile networking.},

A detailed survey of the current state of the art for the development of XR-based simulators is presented in this paper followed by the gap in the current research. The need for a framework based on the current gap is also showcased in the paper. Finally, the proposed Human eXtended Reality Interaction (HXRI) framework for the creation of XR-based training environments for surgical contexts is discussed.},

  abstract={with the rapid development of intelligent technology, the product image design process made the transition from “mechanized” to “intellectualized”. With a view to making the product image design scenario and process central focuses, this paper intends to expound upon research into intelligent technology. A theoretical framework, Kansei engineering, will form the basis of discussion into the image design decision optimization system. Firstly, the key developing technologies that facilitate the use of product image design decision system are detailed, namely, computer aided design system (CAD), X reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI). Secondly, an application analysis of the CAD, XR and AI is made of the product image design decision optimization system, respectively. Thirdly, the effective characteristics of the product image design decision optimization system will be depicted, including intelligence, digitization, and integration within the industrial design process. Finally, the ways that product image design system can be optimized will be summarized. The future of development within the industry of product image design technology and the ways that the system can be optimized going forward will be discussed. Combining system optimization with the technology available within the industry could potentially bring about more accurate, efficient, humanized, and intelligent design.},

  abstract={Advances in data collection in radiation therapy have led to an abundance of opportunities for applying data mining and machine learning techniques to promote new data-driven insights. In light of these advances, supporting collaboration between machine learning experts and clinicians is important for facilitating better development and adoption of these models. Although many medical use-cases rely on spatial data, where understanding and visualizing the underlying structure of the data is important, little is known about the interpretability of spatial clustering results by clinical audiences. In this work, we reflect on the design of visualizations for explaining novel approaches to clustering complex anatomical data from head and neck cancer patients. These visualizations were developed, through participatory design, for clinical audiences during a multi-year collaboration with radiation oncologists and statisticians. We distill this collaboration into a set of lessons learned for creating visual and explainable spatial clustering for clinical users.},

  abstract={In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to explore high-performance folded-waveguide (FWG) slow-wave structures (SWSs) for broadband application in traveling-wave tubes (TWTs). DRL combines deep learning (DL) for perception and reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making to form a complete automated system from input data to output action control. The deep  ${Q}$ -network (DQN), a typical model of DRL is employed to learn how to design FWG SWSs like human beings, and to apply the learned design experience to meet different application requirements. To verify the effectiveness of this method concretely, a DQN is trained in  ${G}$ -band to explore the general design policy of FWG SWSs for realizing broadband beam-wave interaction, and it will be exploited to search for well-structured FWG SWSs in the frequency band centered at 850 GHz. Using CST to predict the performance of the structure designed by the DQN, the simulation results show that the reflection coefficient  ${S}_{{11}}$  is less than −20.3 dB and the transmission loss is less than 1.95 dB/mm from 750 to 1000 GHz. With a pencil electron beam of 20 kV and 10 mA, the hot simulation results show that the 3-dB bandwidth with the output power greater than 1.6 W and the gain greater than 26 dB can reach 110 GHz from 800 to 910 GHz. Such a design method will facilitate researchers to obtain a practical FWG structure at specified operating conditions, and help to get a deeper insight into the design process from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI).},

  abstract={The multi-agent system is the subject of a stream of research within distributed artificial intelligence. For achieving a solution to a certain global problem, each agent has its own local goal to be fulfilled. When working on a shared goal each agent would like its priorities to be given the most consideration. Unfortunately, many agents' priorities (arising from their own personal goals) will not be coherent with their fellow agents', thus leading to the conflict problem. This paper presents a formal and executable approach to resolve conflict in multi-agent systems by negotiation and arbitrage. We give the definition of agent, action, environment, negotiation process in formalization. Negotiation and arbitrage strategies of conflict resolution are also presented. Agents can arrive at good solutions by using the above strategies.},

  abstract={Product design tends to be more complex and needs the effective cooperation among multidisciplinary designers and engineers. An ideal product design environment, which is both collaborative and intelligent, will be much appreciated. Agent technology is an innovative and promising approach to implementing distributed systems and is becoming popular in various areas of computing in recent years. In this paper, the dynamic nature of collaborative design process and the representation of collaborative design knowledge are presented. In order to model constantly evolving design process and the rationales resulted from collaboration, a Collaborative Product Data Model (CPDM), which extends traditional Product Data Model (PDM), and a constraint-based Collaborative Design Process Model (CDPM) are proposed. These are intended to facilitate the management and coordination of collaborative product design process and knowledge management. A design example is used to illustrate CDPM. While the system is being implemented, the architecture of our agent-based collaborative product design environment based on CPDM and CDPM is described.},

  abstract={Due to the demographic changes, the demand for care services adapted to the elderly will have an unprecedented growth globally. In this situation, maintaining quality of life (QoL) and wellbeing for older adults will need support of complementary, nontraditional, ICT-based care practices. vINCI project, part of the European research effort in this domain, aims to deliver an integrated technology for the monitoring and instrumentation of the QoL intervention for older adults. The process of designing the vINCI application is based on the patient profile model that will be the input to provide personalized healthcare. The profile is used as evidence to evaluate the impact of vINCI solution on the perceived quality of life provided by caregivers. This paper proposes a complementary approach in modelling the user profile by identifying the needs and preferences of elderly and translating them into development requirements of the vINCI monitoring platform. In this respect, this paper proposes a methodology and methods to define user needs, which are based upon the User Centered Design principles, such as user surveys. The needs survey provides information that is used to specify the needed functional and nonfunctional requirements that vINCI platform must support.},

  abstract={In CSCW and related fields, computer supported collaborative design has been used in various fields. Yet, there has been little research focusing on the collaborative context design for elderly caring. For filling this gap, this paper explores a notion of rule-driven layout co-designing system for elderly caring. What makes it distinct from other layout designing system is that it employs hierarchically modularization to store all standardized components that are needed for the aging caring space, and embeds intelligence algorithm into the typical evidence-based design for improving design efficiency and reducing design costs. In this paper, we designed and implemented a prototype called iCare Designer, and conducted a preliminary study to understand how this notion works in reality. While findings of the preliminary study suggest promises of the notion of rule-driven space layout co-designing system, it reveals some challenges this kind of systems to truly work in practices, mainly reflecting in its flexibility and perception to ambient environment. An in-depth discussion is provided in the end.},

Advantages of simulation games lay in the provision of a safe training environment, where users are able to play, test and probe without serious consequences. At the same time, it is important to engage learners by providing a motivating, challenging environment, which becomes meaningful to the player when skills and knowledge acquired within the game are transferrable to real work tasks. With the use of a participatory game design approach, we developed an immersive, meaningful virtual training environment to improve situational awareness skills. Feedback of game developers as well as from test groups shows that the participatory approach to game development lead to a meaningful experience within an authentic virtual training environment. High functional and physical fidelity, a high degree of realism, compared with challenging game elements makes the developed serious game an appropriate training tool for situational awareness skills.},

  abstract={Each passing day seems to bring new instances of automation of routine tasks and the addition of artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms to new domains. Autonomous systems are a diverse class of technologies ranging from AI driven natural language processing and image recognition to closed-form control systems for aircraft autopiloting. Coincident with this explosion in autonomy is a related drumbeat of stories of AI failures. These failures have ranged from tragedies resulting in bystander deaths to humorous examples of video game flaws being exploited. Widespread deployment and use of autonomous systems will depend on society trusting that these systems will perform as expected. While bias from incomplete training data is a well-trod area for improvement toward reducing AI failures, it is unclear if this bias is a sufficient or merely a necessary condition for loss of trust. What else may be needed for public assurance in autonomous systems? Here we identify three features of diverse autonomous systems that serve as a foundation for assured autonomy. These features are: the accuracy with which the algorithm senses and perceives the environment in a manner relatable to humans; a reduction in bias driven by the training data and algorithmic bias; and the complexity of the algorithmic process in terms of the ability to reverse engineer the decision-making processes. Building from this foundation, future autonomous systems can begin to reverse the loss of trust starting to be seen with respect to these technologies.},

  volume={24},
  number={1},
  pages={371-381},
  abstract={PhenoLines is a visual analysis tool for the interpretation of disease subtypes, derived from the application of topic models to clinical data. Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert. These results suggest that PhenoLines demonstrates promising approaches to support the characterization and optimization of topic models.},

  pages={70242-70260},
  abstract={The modern world is evolving rapidly, especially with respect to the development and proliferation of increasingly intelligent, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-related technologies. Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today's technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a “Human-or-AI” conversation about task assignments to more contextualized “Human-and-AI” way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.},

This move came amidst a growing public concern over the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence (AI), compounded by the lack of an anticipatory process for attending to ethical impact within professional practice. However, the difficulty in moving from principles to practice presents a significant challenge to the implementation of ethical guidelines. Herein, we describe two complementary frameworks for integrating ethical analysis into engineering practice to help address this challenge. We then provide the outcomes of an ethical analysis informed by these frameworks, conducted within the specific context of Internet-delivered therapy in digital mental health. We hope both the frameworks and analysis can provide tools and insights, not only for the context of digital healthcare but also for data-enabled and intelligent technology development more broadly.},

  abstract={The use of semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) to support emergency response scenarios, such as fire surveillance and search-and-rescue, has the potential for huge societal benefits. Onboard sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) allow these UAVs to operate autonomously in the environment. However, human intelligence and domain expertise are crucial in planning and guiding UAVs to accomplish the mission. Therefore, humans and multiple UAVs need to collaborate as a team to conduct a time-critical mission successfully. We propose a meta-model to describe interactions among the human operators and the autonomous swarm of UAVs. The meta-model also provides a language to describe the roles of UAVs and humans and the autonomous decisions. We complement the meta-model with a template of requirements elicitation questions to derive models for specific missions. We also identify common scenarios where humans should collaborate with UAVs to augment the autonomy of the UAVs. We introduce the meta-model and the requirements elicitation process with examples drawn from a search-and-rescue mission in which multiple UAVs collaborate with humans to respond to the emergency. We then apply it to a second scenario in which UAVs support first responders in fighting a structural fire. Our results show that the meta-model and the template of questions support the modeling of the human-on-the-loop human interactions for these complex missions, suggesting that it is a useful tool for modeling the human-on-the-loop interactions for multi-UAVs missions.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has an increasing impact on all areas of people's livelihoods. A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.},

  abstract={Graph algorithms, which are at heart of emerging computation domains such as machine learning, are notoriously difficult to optimize because of their irregular behavior. The challenges are magnified on current CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we study the problem of GPU launch bound configuration in hybrid graph algorithms. We train a multi-objective deep neural network to learn a function that maps input graph characteristics and runtime program behavior to a set of launch bound parameters. When applying launch bounds predicted by our neural network in BFS and SSSP algorithms, we observe as much as 2.76× speedup on certain graph instances and an overall speedup of 1.31 and 1.61, respectively. Similar improvements are seen in energy efficiency of the applications, with an average reduction of 14% in peak power consumption across 20 real-world input graphs. Evaluation of the neural network shows that it is robust and generalizable and yields close to a 90% accuracy on cross-validation.},

  abstract={Implementing systems based on Machine Learning to detect fraud and other Non-Technical Losses (NTL) is challenging: the data available is biased, and the algorithms currently used are black-boxes that cannot be either easily trusted or understood by stakeholders. This work explains our human-in-the-loop approach to mitigate these problems in a real system that uses a supervised model to detect Non-Technical Losses (NTL) for an international utility company from Spain. This approach exploits human knowledge (e.g. from the data scientists or the company&#x2019;s stakeholders) and the information provided by explanatory methods to guide the system during the training process. This simple, efficient method that can be easily implemented in other industrial projects is tested in a real dataset and the results show that the derived prediction model is better in terms of accuracy, interpretability, robustness and flexibility.},

  year={2023},

  pages={47-52},
  abstract={Effort estimation is essential for successful software project planning, budgeting, and risk identification. However, the techniques used to estimate effort are often inaccurate, outdated, and only consider technical factors while neglecting project management or stakeholder engagement. Expert estimation remains an important technique for leveraging human expertise in software estimation, but solely relying on this technique causes biased and subjective predictions. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shifted the direction of software project effort estimation towards computational intelligence. Nonetheless, there is a lack of deployment due to ambiguous outcomes and ineffective model-building approaches. This study presents an ensemble-based framework that can estimate software project effort more accurately with the incorporation of domain knowledge and experiences. To achieve this, six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be constructed using six distinct classifiers on the proposed USP05-FT dataset. The collected expert estimations will be integrated into the proposed dataset as an additional feature in the form of numerical values such as expert-provided software project effort estimations (in person hours) that provide additional insight and knowledge. Subsequently, the predictions of all six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be combined through majority voting to obtain a more accurate and reliable prediction with increased robustness against errors and uncertainties. The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using Recall, F-measure, Precision, and Accuracy. It is expected that the proposed ensemble-based framework for software project effort estimation will lead to more efficient and effective software project management, an improvement in resource allocation, empowering informed decision-making, and timely project delivery.},

  abstract={Our future society will be increasingly digitized and globally data-driven. Mobile communications technologies like 5Gwhile evolving make our daily lives easier and safer, as well as significantly impact on business efficiency. But we start thinking about the next steps - 6G networks. It is not yet clear what the advent of sixth-generation networks will entail. Perhaps thanks to high-resolution visualization and recognition, wearable displays, mobile robots and drones, completely new services such as telepresence and extended reality will be possible. The main issue of the studies is the transfer of data with a rate of up to 1 Tbit/s per user. This may become possible thanks to the efficient use of the spectrum in the THz domain. Another important issue will be using and implementing smart technologies, different type data sources, artificial intelligence and remote (tele-) presence that raise many technical and mathematical problems on the road toward 6G. For these reasons, 6G networks are a huge area for research. This article presents the possible services and involved technologies of the 6G network and its possible features. The following are system-wide trends that will define goals for 6G. In conclusion, a key way-points and research program are suggested.},

  abstract={Division of labor is a widely studied subject of collective behavior in natural systems. It is concerned with the question of how the regulation of the division of labor may contribute to the performance of the multi-agent system. This brief investigates the evolution of the division of labor with three strategies by employing the evolutionary game theory. Thus, these available strategies are provided for the unstructured multi-agent system: strategy A (performing task A), strategy B (performing task B), and strategy C (not performing any task but only interfere other's actions). Depending on the parameter settings in the payoff matrix, four specific scenarios occur and the corresponding stability of the equilibrium points there are provided by calculation. Numerical calculation results are also provided for an intuitive description of the strategy evolution state. Results show that larger synergistic benefit contributes to the effective division of labor in the system, providing high benefits for the multi-agent system. These results help design a effective mechanism where self-organized division of labor occurs in the form of maximizing the benefit of the multi-agent system.},

  abstract={Business Process Management (BPM) has gained remarkable importance in research and practice in the last years. Innovative information and communication technology (ICT) is a driver for the effectiveness and efficiency of enterprise collaboration and the management of inter-organizational business processes. In this context, cooperating enterprises need a shared understanding of their own processes, those of their partners as well as of emerging inter-organizational process structures. In order to create such a shared understanding, the concept of collaborative modeling can serve as a useful approach. This article introduces a concept for collaborative business process modeling and its implementation in the CoMoMod tool. The tool supports several aspects of collaborative process modeling, such as simultaneous work of spatially distributed modelers on one process model diagram. Furthermore the tool permits synchronously creating a collaborative model with different modeling languages by automatically mapping and converting the different model representations. The proof of concept utilizes Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and Petri Nets. The usage of an integrated chat messaging service supports communication during the process of collaboratively modeling business process.},

  pages={152-159},
  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to explore the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots as part of public services, mainly when applied to mental health in today’s post-pandemic world. The adoption of AI chatbots to keep up with basic customer support business activities is based on extensive knowledge, both from the hard (software development) and the soft side (increasing the added value to the service/product). However, using chatbots as extenders of public services to support mental health in pandemic times is an emerging research topic. Hence, the paper identifies niche and under-explored research gaps in state-of-the-art literature, thus contributing to the body of academic knowledge. The paper adopts a design science approach to formulate the problem statement, articulate the objectives of target solutions, and propose a design and development framework for future mental health chatbots by employing an extensive literature review. Findings from this paper emphasize considerations of ethical issues and governance, purposeful and goal-oriented design, and AI-based technology as critical enablers for designing new mental health chatbots. The paper contributes to the knowledge by providing clear and structured future research priorities and offers a framework for designing more effective and intelligent mental health chatbots that public organizations and managers may find useful.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={The current organ placement process for transplantation is an evolving system of systems with emergent behavior. This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders’ needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor “reducing kidney discard” and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons. Future work will include developing data-driven models for all stakeholders using current data incorporating the most recent kidney allocation policy changes.},

  abstract={There is a struggle in Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics to gain ground in actionable methods and models to be utilized by practitioners while developing and implementing ethically sound AI systems. AI ethics is a vague concept without a consensus of definition or theoretical grounding and bearing little connection to practice. Practice involving primarily technical tasks like software development is not aptly equipped to process and decide upon ethical considerations. Efforts to create tools and guidelines to help people working with AI development have been concentrating almost solely on the technical aspects of AI. A few exceptions do apply, such as the ECCOIA method for creating ethically aligned AI -systems. ECCOIA has proven results in terms of increased ethical considerations in AI systems development. Yet, it is a novel innovation, and room for development still exists. This study aims to extend ECCOIA with a deployment model to drive the adoption of ECCOIA, as any method - no matter how good -is of no value without adoption and use. The model includes simple metrics to facilitate the communication of ethical gaps or outcomes of ethical AI development. It offers the opportunity to assess any AI system at any given life-cycle phase, e.g., opening possibilities like analyzing the ethicality of an AI system under acquisition.},

Meanwhile, a lot of current security research lacks adaptation to industrial system upgrades. In this paper, an edge-cloud synergy framework for security decision-making is proposed, which takes advantage of the huge convenience and advantages brought by cloud computing and edge computing, and can make security decisions on a global perspective. Under this framework, a combination of Bayesian network-based risk assessment and stochastic game model-based security decision-making is proposed to generate an optimal defense strategy to minimize system losses. This method trains models in the clouds and infers at the edge computing nodes to achieve rapid defense strategy generation. Finally, a case study on the hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform proves the feasibility of the approach.},

The process is optimized and exported as an IP core. Then, Python is used to import the IP core as a hardware coprocessor at the top level to implement the underlying to top-level data interaction. Finally, the system result is asynchronously updated in the Jupyter notebook. Experiments show that the system has good real-time performance, and the tracking speed averages 27.9FPS. At the same time, it has superior execution efficiency, is easy to develop and transplant, and has certain engineering reference value.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an approach to generate offers and counter-offers in a bilateral negotiation process between cognitive agents with the learning machine capacities. The approach is configured, as each participant of a negotiation process improve their satisfaction degree, gaining knowledge from prior experience, i.e., in the next negotiation session, each participant can individually use this knowledge to redefine the configuration parameters of strategies and tactics to generate offers and counter-offers. Each agent refines their strategies using a genetic algorithm application based on the historical offers and counter-offer exchanges dataset. This context can lead to a new dimension in CSCW system development. This approach was tested in a simulated bilateral negotiation environment, which involved, for example, a buyer agent and a seller agent. The discussions about the results confront different negotiation sessions comparing agents provided with strategy and tactics reconfiguration capabilities and agents using static strategies and tactics.},

  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={137063-137082},
  abstract={A growing number of oil and gas offshore infrastructures across the globe are approaching the end of their operational life. It is a major challenge for the industry to plan and make a decision on the decommissioning as the processes are resource exhaustive. Whether a facility is completely removed, partially removed or left in-situ, each option will affect individual parties differently. Stakeholders’ concerns and needs are collected and analyzed to obtain the most compromised decommissioning decision. Engaging with hundreds of stakeholders is extremely complicated, hence time-consuming and costly. This issue can be addressed using a predictive model to provide suggested decommissioning options based on the data of previously approved projects. However, the lack of readily available relevant datasets is the main hindrance of such an approach. In this paper, we introduce a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset extensively covering all types of offshore infrastructures in the UK landscape over a 21-year period. An experimental framework using several learning algorithms on the new dataset for predicting the decommissioning option is presented. Various resampling methods were applied to tackle the imbalanced class distribution of the dataset for improved classification. Promising results were achieved despite the exclusion of some stakeholder-related features used in the traditional approach. This shows signs of a potential solution for the industry to significantly reduce time and cost spent on a decommissioning project, and encourages more efforts put into researching on this timely topic.},

  abstract={Research in fast-evolving technologies like AI & ML requires the collaborative effort of various stakeholders including industries and universities. In developed economies, industry-university collaboration (IUC) is mature and delivers benefits to both stakeholders. In a developing nation like India, there is relatively less emphasis on IUC and when present, is restricted to a small set of premier institutions. At the undergraduate level, the collaboration between industry and university is very minimal to none. This poses major challenges to industry (insufficient qualified talent pool, higher cost of training fresh recruits, limited choice of external research partners) as well as universities (curriculum lagging latest technology, not reaching full research and innovation potential, source for research funding). This paper summarizes the IUC effort undertaken by Intel Technology India Ltd and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at PES University to create mutually rewarding outcomes for both partners and describes a new model encompassing technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship in addition to the traditional elements of IUC. We present the IUC considerations and processes adopted to deal with the challenges and share the outcomes and impact at the end of two years of engagement and hope that key aspects of this IUC can be leveraged by other industry and university stakeholders for mutually rewarding outcomes.},

  year={2022},
  volume={52},

  pages={907-917},
  abstract={When robotic systems are developed for individualized training during rehabilitation, providing effective feedback to the users is essential. We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time. We conclude with a set of guidelines for developing automated feedback for patient populations.},

  pages={1091-1104},
  abstract={A physical unclonable function (PUF) is a hardware security primitive, which can be used secure various hardware-based applications. As a type of PUFs, strong PUFs have a large number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs), which can be used for authentication. At present, most strong PUF structures follow a one-to-one input/output relationship, i.e., linear function. As such, strong PUF designs are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) based modeling attacks. To address the issue, a dynamically configurable PUF structure is proposed in this article. A mathematical model of the proposed dynamic PUF is presented and the design is proposed against the effective ML based attacks, such as deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression (LR) and reliability-based covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES). Experimental results on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) show that the proposed dynamic structure has achived good uniqueness and reliability. It is also shown that the dynamic PUF has a strong resistance to the CMA-ES attack. Due to the dynamic nature of the proposed PUF structure, an authentication protocol is also designed to generate recognizable authentication bits string. The protocol shows strong resistance to classical machine learning attacks including the new variant of CMA-ES.},

  abstract={Modern electric grids that integrate smart grid technologies require different approaches to grid operations. There has been a shift towards increased reliance on distributed sensors to monitor bidirectional power flows and machine learning based load forecasting methods (e.g., using deep learning). These methods are fairly accurate under normal circumstances, but become highly vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks that could be deployed on the load forecasters. This paper provides a novel model-based Testbed for Simulation-based Evaluation of Resilience (TeSER) that enables evaluating deep learning based load forecasters against stealthy adversarial attacks. The testbed leverages three existing technologies, viz. DeepForge: for designing neural networks and machine learning pipelines, GridLAB-D: for electric grid distribution system simulation, and WebGME: for creating web-based collaborative metamodeling environments. The testbed architecture is described, and a case study to demonstrate its capabilities for evaluating load forecasters is provided.},

  abstract={Civil engineering projects increasingly involve a wide range of stakeholders with diverse interests and multidisciplinary teams. Engineers need soft skills to deal with these teams and stakeholders. “How to educate these soft skills to engineering students?” is the central question for technical universities. The course Collaborative Design and Engineering in the Dutch master's programme Construction Management and Engineering is an answer to that question. Feedback, however, indicated that the course did not meet expectations. The course needed a radical redesign. This paper describes the redesign and resulting framework of the course. The principles of the redesign are constructive alignment, activated learning and not to lecture the skills as `dry stuff'. The resulting course is based on a `pressure cooker - coaching' framework. The pressure cooker part creates a situation in which the students will experience stress. The students work in large groups on a complex assignment under time pressure. A mix of group and individual assignments creates tension between students. The coaching part provides structure and guidance. Theory on the necessary soft skills is introduced early in the course in workshops. Consultation meetings help to keep the students on track. The course has now evolved over three years. Theoretical evaluation shows that the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework fulfills the requirements of constructive alignment. Practical evaluation, using feedback, shows a consistent high score. We consider the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework broadly applicable and is successful enough to continue in our CDE course. Elements of the course can be improved. We consider introducing more theoretical depth and psychology without violating our idea of `no dry stuff' and `action learning'.},

  abstract={Several decision-aid frameworks attempt to provide an optimal solution to the complex, challenging problem of delivering water supply and sanitation services to communities in need. However, a failure in proper needs assessment or handoff causes systemic failure of an installed system. Capacity factors analysis (CFA) is one such framework that focuses on personalized technology-specific alternative recommendations; and it faces similar challenges. While helpful in many ways, designers using CFA still make critical assumptions with regards to community's expressed needs and only passively include the community members in the design process. Appreciative inquiry (AI) is introduced as a means to bridge this gap and increase community empowerment. The AI approach is a four-phase process: discovery, dream, design, and destiny. The process starts with asking community members about their strengths and capabilities, follows with their vision of the community, creates a space for collaborative design, and ends with implementation. A service-learning experience in Tshapasha is provided to demonstrate AI's benefits. The results are compared to a CFA-focused study of Tshapasha from 2011.},

Through this survey, we sought to understand where the students are lacking and what are the different steps that can be taken by the teacher to improve the performance of the student and whether this concept should be reviewed or not. We found that most of the researchers who have published papers that we have read did the same mistake in their research, therefore we realized that the concept of AI should be studied again, and we should try not to repeat the same mistake in our research.The main aim of our project is to build “Teacher facing dashboard” which can help the teacher to summarize,visualize and analyze the data of the education field(academics) and also understanding the students performance using Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning (DL).},

For the outstanding problems such as huge energy consumption, low efficiency and poor timeliness of cloud computing, this paper proposes a low-energy power inspection scheme based on “cloud-fog-edge” collaborative technology. The portable AI diagnostic device at the edge side and the fixed UAV library at the fog side are developed respectively, and the method of two-level traffic offloading and cooperative diagnosis is adopted to sink the AI computing power to the edge side and reduce the pressure of 5G base stations and central servers, so as to achieve the global optimization of system energy consumption and the accurate identification of power equipment defects. To complete an inspection task in cloud computing mode, the system consumes 22,000~32,000 KW·h; to complete an inspection task in cloud edge collaboration mode, the system consumes 12,000~18,000 KW·h at the highest, reducing 16.93%~63.10%; to complete an inspection task in cloud fog edge collaboration mode, the system consumes 7,400~11,000 KW·h, reducing 48.8~77.25%, while the timeliness, accuracy, data security, system stability and inspection efficiency of identification have been greatly improved.},

In this paper, we propose UI-Diffuser, an approach that leverages Stable Diffusion to generate mobile UIs through simple textual descriptions and UI components. Preliminary results show that UI-Diffuser provides an efficient and cost-effective way to generate mobile GUI designs while reducing the need for extensive prototyping efforts.

  pages={1256-1268},
  abstract={As a lightweight hardware security primitive, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can provide reliable identity authentication for devices of Internet of Things (IoTs) with limited resources. However, the delay-based PUF structures in authentication protocols have static responding behaviors, which make them vulnerable to modeling attacks. To address this issue, many complex PUF designs have been designed to increase the nonlinearity of their models. However, most of them can still be broken by modeling-based machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a dynamic responding mechanism for PUF designs to generate dynamic responses is proposed. Different from the concept of logically reconfigurable PUFs, the proposed mechanism does not rely on external inputs to provide reconfiguration signals. And different from the conventional PUF authentication protocols that use large-size linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to extend the master challenge, the proposed scheme uses internally generated dynamic signals to obfuscate the master challenge to generate multiple subchallenges. These subchallenges are then input to the underlying strong PUF to generate multibit dynamic responses. It can prevent an attacker from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs) for the underlying PUF. A security authentication protocol is also proposed, the special authentication bit-string design can resist both conventional ML attacks and the latest covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES) variant.},

  abstract={Airports are one relevant environment in the smart cities implementation. Recent progresses in IoT have made it possible to develop advanced real-time services and assistance tools for travelers, making use of fog computing as an architectural model that places itself between the Cloud and the IoT, in the Cloud-to-Things Continuum, fulfilling requirements for strict real-time responses. The main tool exploits the concept of proximity marketing and covers the essential experience through the airport onto the flight, but also allows travelers to spend their waiting time by discovering the facilities of the airport, supported by a recommendation system using machine learning. The system provides also the airport planners an aggregated and anonymized view, like heat maps, of travelers behavior that highlight bottlenecks in the infrastructure, or highlight situations that require intervention, such as emergencies. The app in based on Android and makes use of the fog-to-cloud platform developed by the Horizon2020-funded mF2C project, giving evidence that the adoption of the fog-to-cloud approach brings significant benefits in terms of performance and optimization of resource usage, giving an objective evidence of the impact of the mF2C framework.},

  abstract={Plenteous research has been undertaken on the direct effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on smart decision-making. However, little attention has been paid to contextual factors such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart governance that mediate the relationship between AI and smart decision-making. This research investigates direct, mediating, and parallel-sequential multiple mediating interactions between AI, the IoT, smart governance, and smart decision-making. We used a self-structured survey to collect cross-sectional data from citizens in the Republic of Korea, and 516 responses were examined using SmartPLS structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). A parallel-sequential multiple mediator framework is assessed using the Hayes Process Model with bootstrapping. Our results reveal a substantial and favorable multi-mediating effect from the IoT and smart governance on the relationship between AI applications and smart decision-making, as predicted. Previous scholars have investigated a few factors that influence decision-making, but our research contributes to the literature of applied and social sciences, including traditional decision theory, by examining the impact of multi-mediating factors on smart decision-making. This study presents both theoretical and practical implications for scholars and policymakers engaged in the development of smart cities. Additionally, this study provides recommendations for future research.},

  abstract={The security in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks becomes increasingly important with the growing popularity of IoT devices and their wide applications (e.g., critical infrastructure monitoring). However, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not suitable for IoT networks due to their large resource requirements. Moreover, IoT networks tend to have multiple access points for IoT devices and thus benefit from a distributed framework to enable collaborative prevention of potential attacks. To this end, we propose a lightweight collaborative distributed network IDS (NIDS) based on widely-utilized machine learning (ML) models, which are trained through a federated learning framework with two known datasets. We evaluate the distributed NIDS using the trained ML models on an IoT network testbed under seven types of attacks in comparison with Snort (a state-of-the-art IDS) and a centralized implementation of our proposed NIDS. An offline benchmark is also designed to measure the system’s performance with regard to resource usage and response time. Our results show that the proposed distributed NIDS outperforms Snort in identifying malicious traffic and achieves a much lower false positive rate compared to the centralized version in real-time for all seven types of network attacks tested.},

  abstract={Participatory design is a popular design technique that involves the end-users in the early stages of the design process to obtain user-friendly gestural interfaces. Guessability studies followed by agreement analyses are often used to elicit and comprehend the preferences (gestures/proposals) of the participants. Previous approaches to assess agreement, grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this work, we represent the gestures using binary description vectors to allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as a soft agreement rate (SAR) to quantify the level of consensus between the participants. In addition, we performed computational experiments to study the behavior of our partial agreement formula and mathematically show that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our methodology was evaluated through a gesture elicitation study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR metric is 2.64 times higher than the existing metrics. In addition to the most agreed gesture, SAR formulation also provides the mostly agreed descriptors which can potentially help the designers to come up with a final gesture set.},

  abstract={The management of coupled human-natural (CHN) systems, including natural resource and environmental systems, would benefit from recognition of the need to integrate, and bring critical thinking, transparency, and accountability to science and policy development. It would benefit also from: (1) stakeholder engagement and participatory processes, (2) societal and institutional continuity in science and decisions evaluation and follow-through, and (3) recognition and understanding of the role of biases, beliefs, heuristics, and values (BBHV) in decision-making.We suggest that creating multi-media, efficiently accessible, "Records of Engagement" (RoE) could support meeting the above needs. RoE would offer: (1) a reward system to support and foster stakeholder engagement; (2) a record structure for evaluating processes and outcomes and for learning and knowledge transfer, and (3) an opportunity to systematize, facilitate, create efficiencies, and improve the engagement of experts and stakeholders in participatory modeling, planning and policy development. RoE, in our view, should also not only describe scientific evidence and lines of argumentation but also BBHV and emotions expressed, a first step in understanding their impacts on decision making and management of CHN systems.We seek to engage readers to help us determine how to create RoE, including what they might contain to be most useful. Preliminary thoughts are offered on RoE framework design and content, and on a Decision Tracking System and methodologies that could be used to support creation and use of RoE. Some existing stakeholder engagement records are discussed in reference to the ideal RoE that we envision.},

  abstract={Extended Reality (XR) is actively bringing innovative opportunities to business, from Virtual Reality (VR) assistants to Augmented Reality (AR) sales advertisements. However, there is currently a lack of adaptive profiling in training simulators, limiting their potential, effectiveness, dynamicity, and customization. This paper proposes the use of a Content-Based Recommender System integrated into an XR simulator to predict training scenarios for the user. Although customization can be achieved in many ways, this project focuses on in-game input data: user interaction with virtual objects, decisions made by the user, and metadata associated with the training scenario (plot keywords, characters involved in the scenarios, objects metadata, scenario category and room in which the scenario takes place). The results of the user study show that the participants enjoyed the simulation and preferred a dynamic and customized training narrative compared to a standard linear one. This innovative approach will enable in the future the automation of personalized training simulations, creating targeted and individual XR experiences for each user.},

  abstract={Low-cost virtual-reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) with the integration of smartphones have brought the immersive VR to the masses, and increased the ubiquity of VR. However, these systems are often limited by their poor interactivity. In this paper, we present GestOnHMD, a gesture-based interaction technique and a gesture-classification pipeline that leverages the stereo microphones in a commodity smartphone to detect the tapping and the scratching gestures on the front, the left, and the right surfaces on a mobile VR headset. Taking the Google Cardboard as our focused headset, we first conducted a gesture-elicitation study to generate 150 user-defined gestures with 50 on each surface. We then selected 15, 9, and 9 gestures for the front, the left, and the right surfaces respectively based on user preferences and signal detectability. We constructed a data set containing the acoustic signals of 18 users performing these on-surface gestures, and trained the deep-learning classification pipeline for gesture detection and recognition. Lastly, with the real-time demonstration of GestOnHMD, we conducted a series of online participatory-design sessions to collect a set of user-defined gesture-referent mappings that could potentially benefit from GestOnHMD.},

The traditional product development framework and methodology is a waterfall style, which is usually described as the V model. In the V model, the design result of the earliest stage will be validated, verified and accredited at the last stage. In order to reduce the cycle of verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) and increase the probability of successful design within fewest iterations, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) proposes a design information transferring methodology based on digital models, which extends the V model to double Vs model. The development of big data technology and data-driven machine learning provides an opportunity to converge data lifecycle, model lifecycle and product development lifecycle together. The paper reviews product development models from V to double Vs, and presents a model and data driven triple Vs model for product development in the big data era.},

  abstract={Curriculum size constantly challenges healthcare education and training. Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset. An example such term is described and presented as proof of application. The semantic modelling implemented in this work is directly applicable to a previously proposed visual data structure and subsequent authoring environment that could facilitate XR resource design and authoring from non-technical experts.},

  abstract={Validation of software requirements is a primary phase in requirements engineering that ensures requirements match the target system with the intended needs of the acquirer. It aims to detect and correct errors that prevail in the specified requirements. Although there are tremendous requirements validation approaches, some software may fail because of limited or ineffective requirements validation techniques and unreliable requirements’ quality characteristics. In this study, a systematic literature review of requirements validation is performed. The study analyzes the most adopted validation techniques, reports requirements quality characteristics, and discovers significant challenges of validation techniques. The review identified 66 relevant primary studies analyzed to derive deep insights into the following aspects of requirements validation: trends of requirements validation methods, including their subtechnique strengths and weaknesses, requirements quality characteristics categories, and adopted tools and datasets in these techniques. We grouped validation techniques into categories: prototyping, inspection, knowledge-oriented, test-oriented, modeling and assessment, and formal models. The analysis reported 19 validation techniques, 27 tools, new requirements validation characteristics, and several challenges that prevailed through validation techniques. The trend of validation techniques is to those methods that apply machine learning techniques with knowledge from dictionaries and ontologies. Most challenges are about how to express the requirements and how to revert clients’ feedback. There is a strong relationship between validation techniques, software application domain, and requirements validation quality attributes. Thus, there is an immense need to unify the quality characteristics and domain-specific validation methods.},

A proof-of-concept desktop system, namely, virtual intelligent assembly system for machine tools (VIASMT) based on multi-agent and Petri-net has been proposed and developed to display assembly process and demonstrate correlative functions of virtual machine tool. The common feature of traditional methods is that establishing a precise state equation to simulate the dynamic process of system. But, VIASMT can't be described by accurate mathematical method in fact. Relatively speaking, Petri net has stronger ability to describe the dynamic property of system perfectly, and its graphic means is more easily to be understood and accepted. Some software development kits such as visual C++ and Open Inventor are used to implement the VIASMT with the help of multi-agent and Petri-net technologies. The work flowchart is given. In this virtual intelligent assembly system, a new machine tool can be assembled easily and rapidly. In this paper, several application instances are provided},

  pages={229-233},
  abstract={The crowdsourcing design service model provides an effective way for the R&#x0026;D and innovation of the manufacturing industry and the personalized and service-oriented development of products. Intellectual property is the core resource in the crowdsourcing design service model, which is faced with various risks due to the lack of effective control. In this context, this paper proposes an intellectual property risk assessment method based on an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in crowdsourcing design. First of all, the influencing factors of intellectual property risk in crowdsourcing design are analyzed, and a set of intellectual property risk assessment index system is constructed. Secondly, a risk assessment model based on ANFIS is established to quantitatively assess intellectual property risks in crowdsourcing design. Finally, the proposed ANFIS model has been trained and evaluated, and the experimental results show that the method can achieve accurate evaluation of intellectual property risks.},

  abstract={Collaboration is essential to improve product quality, lower delays, and maximize profits. However, for effective collaboration, the data needs to be shared across organizations. Two problems arise: what and how much data to share and how to synchronize changes to shared data efficiently. Additionally, shared information must be independently verifiable to enhance trust. To address these issues, we present Pegasus. It provides ontology, heuristic rules and, smart contract templates. A case study in collaborative design from a large Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) illustrates Pegasus’s application, strengths, and weaknesses. The evaluation uses Hyperledger Fabric on Amazon Web Services.},

  pages={1373-1378},
  abstract={The evolution of the economic environment towards services orientation has introduced new challenges for companies. They attempt to design innovative services to support the value creation of their customer's business. In this context the knowledge is becoming a key matter for strategy and innovation. Many scholars have stressed the knowledge management approaches for the design of products. However services provide new issues which are linked to their own characteristics (e.g. intangibility, heterogeneity, coproduction). The methods and tools of knowledge management have to be adapted to the field of services design. Indeed it is important to acquire, represent and reuse the service-related knowledge which is tacit and co-created by providers, customers and others partners working together. Our work pursues the ongoing discussion of SSME (services science, management and engineering), an emergent discipline gathering the synergies around services science. It is also based on the example of a telecommunication operator which is trying to improve its methods to design services. Our approach is supported by a framework which describes services as services systems and a Web-based studio called SBCD (services browser for collaborative design). This paper gives an overview of this framework's main features (change of state, co-construction, business processes, services medium and access). Then it focuses on the role of knowledge in this context and proposes a knowledge acquisition method for the construction of an ontology to describe services systems.},

  abstract={The interaction between instructors and students is one of the key concepts to improve the student's learning process. To personalize learning on a massive scale, social bots can be used as supporting technology. However, their development for virtual learning environments currently requires deep technical knowledge. This leaves learner communities relying on highly-skilled developers to generate and tailor these social bots. Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots. We see the potential of this approach to move the development closer to the actual learner.},

  abstract={The aim of this work is to propose a methodology of sizing in a frame of the conception of mechatronic systems in particular and active dynamic ones, in general. This methodology will support conceptual design step. We propose a collaborative design approach based on Bond Graph tool and Genetic algorithms. Mechatronic systems have a passive part and active part. In our approach we establish a hard interaction between passive and active parts. This interaction will be materialized in taking into account of control criteria in the evolution (synthesis) phase of passive part. This initiative treats functional aspects, both structural and behavioral; while respecting interactions between passive and active parts. In our approach we treat functional, structural and behavioral aspects in order to validate a post-project solution. Optimization needs Behavioral models which are systematically deducted from bond-graph structural models. Thus, retained bond graph elements which constitute passive part will be obtained, done by optimization Genetic Algorithms procedure. In this procedure Gramians of controllability and of observability represent the fitness function. The proposed method will be applied to an automatic transmission of a scooter and validated by a dynamic simulation.},

  abstract={Minimum volume design is traditionally used as an optimization method which is based on objectives, design variables and constraint conditions, rather than a guiding principle that can promote the creative design. According to the tendency of modern design and the former optimization design of minimum volume, this paper proposes a new volume minimizing design principle(VMDP) in computer supported collaborative design (CSCD). The aim of VMDP is to excavate human being’s design wisdom and creative ability of manufacture and design maximally, to excavate the material’s properties and potential abilities maximally. The essence of VMDP is to realize that the product’s units and subunits occupy the minimal volume while their functions and capacities are maximum in unit volume, the products will be manufactured with the least material resources while they have the benefits of green design and manufacture. According to binary inference feedback algorithm, the optimization theory and mathematical model of the volume minimizing design principle in guiding the design process are developed.},

  abstract={In this paper, we examine the challenges of developing international standards for Trustworthy AI that aim both to be global applicable and to address the ethical questions key to building trust at a commercial and societal level. We begin by examining the validity of grounding standards that aim for international reach on human right agreements, and the need to accommodate variations in prioritization and tradeoffs in implementing rights in different societal and cultural settings. We then examine the major recent proposals from the OECD, the EU and the IEEE on ethical governance of Trustworthy AI systems in terms of their scope and use of normative language. From this analysis, we propose a preliminary minimal model for the functional roles relevant to Trustworthy AI as a framing for further standards development in this area. We also identify the different types of interoperability reference points that may exist between these functional roles and remark on the potential role they could play in future standardization. Finally we examine a current AI standardization effort under ISO/IEC JTC1 to consider how future Trustworthy AI standards may be able to build on existing standards in developing ethical guidelines and in particular on the ISO standard on Social Responsibility. We conclude by proposing some future directions for research and development of Trustworthy AI standards.},

  abstract={In general a design process is complex and requires the collaboration of several designers on the same product to improve its reliability, performance and efficiency. Though the increase of the Internet as a communication means that supports the sharing and transferring of knowledge, the collaborative declarative design phase lacks for a) imprecision in declaring the statements (ambiguity) and b) subjective interpretation of a scene with respect to the current designer's profile. For this reason, on-line learning strategies should be applied, which models the actual user's preferences. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptable learning strategy for dynamic modeling of a designer profile based an adaptable neural network architecture. The scheme optimally updates the network weights in a way that the current designers' preferences are trusted as much as possible, while simultaneously a minimal degradation of the already obtained network knowledge is minimized. The algorithm requires low computational complexity and guarantees stable performance instead of conventional neural network training schemes, whose the solution is often trapped to local minima.},

In view of the fact that digital twins lack of data interaction and linkage between physical domain and information domain in the whole life cycle, which cannot meet the demand of rapid driving of multi-dimensional information of digital twin products. In order to support product design, this paper studies the modeling framework of digital twins first, and proposes a product design modeling framework including physical layer, model layer, information layer and application layer. Then, based on the meta-modeling method, the digital twin design meta-model is defined, which includes business metadata, data model and associated metamodel. Meanwhile, a unified description model for the whole life cycle of digital twins is constructed, which includes the relational sets of metadata models such as process, resources, knowledge and products. The data interaction between physical entities and digital twins is completed, which solves the problems of data interaction between physical domains and information domains, data exchange and information sharing among heterogeneous models, and realizes the association and fusion of multi-dimensional information in the whole life cycle of digital twins.},

  abstract={Design of the intelligent construction engineering frame based on the communication information visualization is presented in this paper. High-rise intelligent buildings are different from low-rise buildings. They have higher requirements for high and low voltage power distribution systems and lightning and fire protection. Therefore, when the actual electrical design is carried out, the optimization design should be focused on, so as to provide the necessary guarantee for people's living safety. Based on this, the paper proposes the 2 aspects of the novelties. (1) The realization of the cost minimization enables network engineers and designers to the focus on the network optimization, especially to make the changes in general mobile communication more obvious. The novel communication method is designed for the improvement of the system. (2) Correction warning information must be transmitted to the processing platform in the shortest time, and the processing results should be fed back to the alarm platform. The novel information mode is designed to be applied for the system.},

  abstract={Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the direct application of information technology in the construction industry. It has many advantages such as shared API data interfaces, high data integration, data consistency, data relevance and construction demonstration functions. It has been widely used and achieved remarkable results. In the 21st century, the development trend of Beijing city is to develop towards the sky and underground. Especially in the past ten years, with the increase of high-rise and super high-rise buildings in Beijing, and the booming development of subway construction. The underground continuous wall is a construction technology with very high use value whether it is used as the main body (or part of the main body) of the underground structure or as a waterproof and soil retaining facility during construction. However, in the Beijing area, the underground diaphragm wall (depth greater than 40 meters, width greater than or equal to 1.2 meters) due to the difficulty of the project, complex technology, and many construction problems, the relevant design and construction experience is less, and the relevant technical talents are scarce. The purpose of this article is to study the application of BIM in underground continuous walls. This article is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 development platform, based on the Visual C# programming language, using the API data interface provided by the Revit 2018 software, based on the built BIM model, for engineering quantity statistics, collision checking, drawing output, collaborative work and construction models. Wait for operations to show the application of BIM technology in the underground continuous wall. Experiments show that the use of the collision detection function of BIM technology can not only reasonably arrange pipelines, but also adjust the positions of brackets, buttresses and other components to facilitate the on-site installation of pipelines. The use of BIM technology can simulate the hoisting of the pipe gallery, find out the collision points in the hoisting process, and improve the hoisting plan.},

We use emerging VR dating applications, colloquially called the dating metaverse, as context for study of harm-mitigative design structures in social VR given the evidence of harms that occur through dating apps and general social VR applications individually, and the harms that may occur through their convergence. Through design workshops with potential dating metaverse users in the Midwest United States (n=18) we elucidate nonconsensual experiences that should be prevented and participant-created designs for informing and exchanging consent in VR. We position consent as a valuable lens for which to design preventative solutions to harm in social VR by reframing harm as unwanted experiences that happen because of the absence of mechanics to support users in giving and denying agreement to a virtual experience before it occurs.},

This robot was developed under a human-centered design approach with participatory design practices during two years and involving 142 children as active contributors at all design stages. The main contribution of this work is the development of methods and tools for child-centered robot design. We adapted existing participatory design practices used with adults to fit children’s development stages. We followed the DoubleDiamond Design Process Model and rested the design process of the robot on the following principles: low floor and wide walls, creativity provocations, open-ended playfulness, and disappointment avoidance through abstraction. The final product is a social robot designed for and with children. Our results show that YOLO increases their creativity during play, demonstrating a successful robot design project. We identified several guidelines that made the design process successful: the use of toys as tools, playgrounds as spaces, the emphasis of playfulness for child expression, and child policies as allies for design studies. The design process described empowers children’s in the design of robots.CCS CONCEPTS• Human-centered computing $\rightarrow$Human computer interaction (HCI).},

  abstract={As the aviation industry is actively working on adopting AI for air traffic, stakeholders agree on the need for a human-centered approach. However, automation design is often driven by user-centered intentions, while the development is actually technology-centered. This can be attributed to a discrepancy between the system designers’ perspective and complexities in real-world use. The same can be currently observed with AI applications where most design efforts focus on the interface between humans and AI, while the overall system design is built on preconceived assumptions. To understand potential usability issues of AI-driven cockpit assistant systems from the users’ perspective, we conducted interviews with four experienced pilots. While our participants did discuss interface issues, they were much more concerned about how autonomous systems could be a burden if the operational complexity exceeds their capabilities. Besides commonly addressed human-AI interface issues, our results thus point to the need for more consideration of operational complexities on a system-design level.},

  abstract={A distributed virtual environment (DVE) consists of multiple network nodes (servers), each of which can host many users that consume CPU resources on that node and communicate with users on other nodes. Users can be dynamically migrated between the nodes, and the ultimate goal for the migration policy is to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. In order to achieve this, the user migration policy should minimize network communication while balancing the load among the nodes so that CPU resources of the individual nodes are not overloaded. This paper considers a multi-player online game as an example of a DVE and presents an adaptive distributed user migration policy, which uses Reinforcement Learning to tune itself so as to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. Performance of the self-tuning policy was compared on a simulator with the standard benchmark non-adaptive migration policy and with the optimal static user allocation policy in a variety of scenarios, and the self-tuning policy was shown to greatly outperform both benchmark policies, with performance difference increasing as the network became more overloaded.},

  abstract={The interaction between technology and healthcare has a long history. However, recent years have witnessed the rapid growth and adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the advent of miniature wearable biosensors, and research advances in big data techniques for effective manipulation of large, multiscale, multimodal, distributed, and heterogeneous data sets. These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs. To enable this transformation, it is necessary for a large number of significant technological advancements in the hardware and software communities to come together. This keynote paper addresses all these important aspects of novel IoT technologies for smart healthcare-wearable sensors, body area sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and big data analytics. It identifies new perspectives and highlights compelling research issues and challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, and security, with various case studies. In addition, with the help of examples, we show how knowledge from CAD areas, such as large scale analysis and optimization techniques can be applied to the important problems of eHealth.},

  abstract={Supply chain networks are typical examples of complex systems. Thereby, making decisions in such systems remains a very hard issue. To assist decision makers in formulating the appropriate strategies, robust tools are needed. Pure optimization models are not appropriate for several reasons. First, an optimization model cannot capture the dynamic behavior of a complex system. Furthermore, most common practical problems are very constrained to be modeled as simple tractable models. To fill in the gap, hybrid optimization/simulation techniques have been applied to improve the decision-making process. In this paper we explore the near-full spectrum of optimization methods and simulation techniques. A review and taxonomy were performed to give an overview of the broad field of optimization/simulation approaches applied to solve supply chain problems. Since the possibilities of coupling them are numerous, we launch a discussion and analysis that aims at determining the appropriate framework for the studied problem depending on its characteristics.

  abstract={This Research Full Paper addresses the definition and implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 education. CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.},

  pages={1650-1662},
  abstract={The global manufacturing industry is entering an era of considerable growth and innovation due to radical developments in advanced technologies. Knowledge remains crucial in improving product design, decision making, productivity, and increasing the speed of innovation. Communication is at the heart of knowledge exchange between stakeholders, especially those with different technical and social backgrounds. However, significant barriers exist when sharing product design knowledge due to the lack of available formalized tools and methods. In this article, to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders during product design, a method to systematically improve the understanding of target objects, including the composition of the object, nature of the object, and tools to support its related communication, is proposed. Further, a knowledge representation framework is described which enables parties to clearly understand the characteristics of the object and greatly improve communication efficiency. A case study is presented to validate how the proposed framework provides valuable insights into the improvement of design communication and contributes to global manufacturing development.},

  abstract={Many managers are looking to engage employees and customers because they know this is one of the key factors in running a successful business. In the first place, this will reduce the customers and employees churn and will further increase their loyalty and satisfaction to the organization. Using gamification to engage stakeholders is an interesting topic for many organizations, but the lack of a clear procedure for applying these methods has led to not achieving the expected results. In this study, we will introduce a new technique for designing gamification in servicing companies in which customers and employees interact with each other also examine the principles of setting up a game site based on statistical computing and data mining algorithms.},

  abstract={Information and communication technology has been hailed for playing a crucial role in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. That notwithstanding, the realization of this agenda depends on the convergence of sustainable use and deployment of ICT with strong commitment from local and global partnerships and corporations. Thus, to achieve the 17 UN SDGs, local efforts and realities must be incorporated. Like many other countries, the Finnish government has set an ambitious goal to be a carbon-neutral nation by 2035. However, research on how such an ambitious target could be achieved is lacking. As such, the overarching objective of this study was to suggest a pathway for building a Green ICT Ecosystem. We reflect on our experience in building a green ICT ecosystem with the involvement of key ICT ecosystem stakeholders to adopt Green ICT practices. The lessons learned from creating a green IC ecosystem showed the importance of understanding stakeholders' diverse needs and challenges and consolidating numerous Green ICT approaches and strategies. We proposed a framework to serve as a guide for replication in other countries. To the best of our knowledge, this framework will likely be the first study to provide a blueprint for creating a Green ICT ecosystem to advance the convergence of ICT and stakeholder collaboration in archiving sustainable development.},

  abstract={This paper provides an extensive overview of cybersecurity awareness in the young, educated, and technology-savvy population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), compared to the United States of America (USA) for advancing the scholarship and practice of global cyber governance. We conducted comparative empirical studies to identify differences in specific human factors that affect cybersecurity behaviour in the UAE and the USA. In addition, we employed several control variables to observe reliable results. We used Hofstede’s theoretical framework on culture to advance our investigation. The results show that the targeted population in the UAE exhibits contrasting interpretations of cybersecurity awareness of critical human factors as compared to their counterparts from the USA. We identify possible explanations for this relatively different behaviour in the UAE population. Our key contributions are to provide valuable information for cybersecurity policymakers in the UAE and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region to further enhance cyber safety, governance, awareness, and trust among citizens.},

Based on this, the fundamental principles and requirements of DAOs are explained, while the infrastructure based on cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) and parallel intelligence, as well as the supporting technologies, such as digital twins, metaverse, and Web3, are discussed. Besides, a five-layer intelligent architecture is presented, and the closed-loop equation and new function-oriented intelligent algorithms are also proposed. Moreover, the governance mechanisms from the individual, organizational and social perspectives are discussed, and the incentive mechanisms for the human, robot, and digital human are analyzed.

  pages={4887-4895},
  abstract={This paper presents a multi-labeled semi-supervised study that includes a small labeled dataset and an unlabeled dataset. With the co-training framework, we combine a two-view semi-supervised learning for text classification by implementing two neural networks. As in the original co-training paradigm, the text is classified according to two independent learner views using two separate classifiers. In order to extend this idea to deep learning, the deep co-training model uses deep neural networks to train on different views of generated samples to calculate similarity in the probability distribution of predicted outcomes. This co-training framework depends on co-trained networks in order to classify text into multiple labels. Furthermore, the method adds noise to keep the classifier from being affected by it during prediction. As a result, such co-trained networks provide more relevant data and improve classification accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach, we compare it to state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning classifiers on a dataset of survivor stories of human rights violations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={49},
  number={4},
  pages={2149-2168},
  abstract={Failure to consider the characteristics, limitations, and abilities of diverse end-users during mobile app development may lead to problems for end-users, such as accessibility and usability issues. We refer to this class of problems as human-centric issues. Despite their importance, there is a limited understanding of the types of human-centric issues that are encountered by end-users and taken into account by the developers of mobile apps. In this paper, we examine what human-centric issues end-users report through Google App Store reviews, what human-centric issues are a topic of discussion for developers on GitHub, and whether end-users and developers discuss the same human-centric issues. We then investigate whether an automated tool might help detect such human-centric issues and whether developers would find such a tool useful. To do this, we conducted an empirical study by extracting and manually analysing a random sample of 1,200 app reviews and 1,200 issue comments from 12 diverse projects that exist on both Google App Store and GitHub. Our analysis led to a taxonomy of human-centric issues that characterises human-centric issues into three-high level categories: App Usage, Inclusiveness, and User Reaction. We then developed machine learning and deep learning models that are promising in automatically identifying and classifying human-centric issues from app reviews and developer discussions. A survey of mobile app developers shows that the automated detection of human-centric issues has practical applications. Guided by our findings, we highlight some implications and possible future work to further understand and better incorporate addressing human-centric issues into mobile app development.},

  pages={1-386},
  abstract={At present, smart Homes are receiving more attention as they are becoming the predominant space that houses people’s activities. Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.},

  pages={342-347},
  abstract={To specify good requirements, system analysts need to understand the domain knowledge of the system. There are several techniques in requirements elicitation to improve domain knowledge understanding, such as user interviews, questioners, document analysis, and brainstorming. Most of these techniques require profound stakeholder involvement. However, not all software projects can do this task due to limited time or availability of stakeholders. In agile software development, the user story is the de facto standard used for capturing and writing functional requirements. The user story is an appropriate format and easy to understand for writing the results of requirements elicitation. This study purposes a conceptual model to extract user story from online news for improving domain knowledge understanding. The information in the online news contained lesson learned related to certain events. This information may improve the functionality of the software products. The user story consists of three aspects, namely: who, what, and why. Aspect of who represents the role or user, aspect of what shows the purpose or feature, while the aspect of why explains the reason. This format can summarize the lessons learned in the news. Our experimental results indicate that this conceptual model can extract user story from online news. The model manages to extract 105 user stories from 92 aspects of what/why candidate and 109 aspects of who candidate.},

  abstract={Efficiency monitoring is one of the important tasks in monitoring of employees activities, the solution of which is constantly in the focus of researchers and is still not supported by automated methods and universal tools. This task is especially relevant if the field of activity is narrowly specific, and solving such a task of efficiency monitoring is not a trivial accumulation of statistical data, but requires a unique method. However, potentially the method of evaluating the work efficiency of this specific field is not commonly used or adaptable in the analysis of a wide range of activities. The work of an engineering system designer is an example of such specific activities. This paper offers a method for construction of a unified model of behavior of users of specialized IT systems in the engineering design industry, which offers to evaluate the efficiency of work based on the development of a user profile that collects information about the designer's activities, sequence and times. The method defines the input data, the result output data, AI/ML algorithms for output data acquisition and is supported with the prototype system for the visual representation of the expected result, which is based on the input / output data regularities.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the process of curriculum design in higher education to address the need for the development of digital competences of industrial engineers. In the light of digital transformation, an increasing amount of pedagogy literature, policy papers, and practitioners call for the development of digital competences. However, concrete approaches to tackle this issue in practice are still scarce. We followed a participatory action research approach together with stakeholders of a university of applied sciences to develop the foundations of a curriculum to equip engineering graduates with additional managerial, social, and psychological insights and approaches to succeed in digital transformation or Industry 4.0 projects in manufacturing companies. In several workshops with undergraduates, faculty, alumnae, researchers, and industry representatives the needs and prospective job profiles of such digital transformation managers were defined. The therefore required competences were prioritized applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by comparing the necessary knowledge, skills, as well as attitudes and values (KSA). The results first show difficulties in establishing a common understanding of required competences between the stakeholders due to the complexity of the notion of digital transformation. Nevertheless, the stakeholder involvement process and the AHP as decision support can serve as a suitable basis for the design process of engineering curricula, as well as in other contexts.},

  abstract={This paper reports on a survey about the perceptions and practices of social media managers and experts in the area of public health. We have collected Facebook data from 153 public health care organizations and conducted a survey on them. 12% of organizations responded to the questionnaire. The survey results were combined with the findings from our previous work of applying clustering and supervised learning algorithms on big social data from the official Facebook walls of these organizations. In earlier research, we showed that the most successful strategy that leads to higher post engagement is visual content. In this paper, we investigated if organisations pursue this strategy or some other strategy that was successful and has not been uncovered by the machine learning algorithms. Performance of each organisation on Facebook is based on the number of posts (volume share) and the number of actions (value share). Calculation of performance with number of actions in the numerator and number of posts in the denominator reduces possible bias in the conclusions due to the varied size of organizations on social media. Moreover, our survey attempts to better understand the behaviour of organizations and to explain why almost half of the public health care content posted on Facebook is in the form of a short text message, where as the information can be communicated through seven other post types. Similar patterns and characteristics for different engagement clusters, also high and low performing companies suggests that a mixed-methods research approach consisting of machine learning techniques combined with expert knowledge using qualitative methods can offer important insights.},

Analytic Hierarchy Process is used as key component of the game engine, and enables an iterative prioritisation process. The GRP process has been evaluated through an exploratory case study, which has been conducted at a small software company, providing us with preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The main findings and lessons learned from the case study are presented.},

  abstract={The detection of old submerged ammunition that is located on or below the seabed is an important preparatory work for offshore projects. Multibeam echosounder, side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler, and magnetometers are the sensor types that are most commonly used for the task. Survey design decisions center around both detection campaign efficiency and sufficient data quality to find specific reference objects. This article presents a comprehensive workflow for unexploded ordnance surveys in the sea and focuses on aspects of quantitative data quality control. For this purpose, data quality factors and corresponding threshold values were developed for each of the main sensor types. The authors designed and moderated a workshop-based stakeholder engagement process to establish expert consensus on suitable data quality factors and appropriate calculation of thresholds that define which data are sufficient and which are not. This approach was accompanied by a literature review of existing guidelines, standards, and survey recommendations. A quantitative description of data quality eases analyzing and comparing newly acquired and existing data. This article presents the results of this process, thereby providing guidance for the planning, execution, and quality control of a technical investigation with the aim of finding unexploded ordnance in the sea. The defined data quality factors derived from the literature review and collective expert knowledge can be used in the suggested workflow.},

  abstract={With the development of new generation intelligent manufacturing and network technologies, the green manufacturing industry, represented by New Energy Vehicle (EV), is transforming to large-scale collaborative network production under regional industrial zone. It promotes the core manufacturing enterprises and related upstream and downstream enterprises to manage the massive, heterogeneous and scattered collaboration data for the whole life-cycle processes, namely design, manufacturing, services and sales, and thus to provide the collaborative services. However, the traditional data management manners are fixed, single and private, and mainly depend on data models and lack on-demand integration, which is unable to cope with the increasing demands for big data management and collaboration relations. Therefore, this paper focuses on EV domain, and studies on the new generation core enterprise-dominated collaborative dataspace management framework. Firstly, the data management requirements for the whole life cycle business collaboration of EV enterprises zone are given. Then, according to the requirements, the collaboration framework is developed, which includes resource layer, space layer, service layer and subject layer. Finally, the collaborative design case is applied to verify the feasibility and practicability of dataspace framework, which provides theoretical and application references for the data integration and management, and thus to urge the core enterprise-dominated whole life cycle business collaboration.},

  abstract={The ongoing digital revolution is having a significant impact on homes and communities worldwide, affecting access to information, communication, learning, and sports. One of the most significant changes brought about by this revolution is the shift from traditional classroom-based education to virtual and hybrid online learning environments. Higher education institutions, in particular, are recognizing the value of online educational programs, which allow them to expand their digital pre se n ce, increase access to their programs, and reach students beyond their physical borders. The advancements in educational technology made possible by the 4th Industrial Revolution are also allowing for more flexible, engaging, and accessible learning experiences for both students and teachers. However, there remains a significant gap in terms of education planning, access to digital learning tools, and engagement among stakeholders. This research uses data analytics to examine cl oud-based digital learning tools, education stakeholder engagement, and education access. The findings provide insight for academic stakeholders, particularly governments, private sector, and educational investors, on ways to bridge the gaps between access and engagement for students and teachers.},

  abstract={The widespread usage of the Internet and the abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have compelled higher education institutes (HEIs) worldwide to shift their academic and administrative affairs online. These unprecedented changes have caused issues in relation to trust, identity authentication, and stakeholder engagement that cripple HEIs' effective digitalisation of educational practices. Additionally, the ecosystem of HEIs has become more complex because it involves various heterogeneous information systems and the diverse demands of decentralised stakeholders, such as lecturers, students, and alumni. To address these emerging problems, blockchain has become a potentially disruptive technology that can facilitate practical innovation and provide opportunities for the re-engineering of traditional HEIs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to consolidate the fragmented knowledge of blockchain applications in higher education based on the current literature of related research domains, blockchain benefits, and additional challenges for future studies. The paper consists of a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines and an analysis of 79 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2018 and December 2022 by making an extensive literature search of Scopus, Taylor and Francis Online, and Web of Science databases. The results illustrate that blockchain is being explored and utilised to create new interventions to promote the sharing, securing, and management of data and knowledge and to enhance the coordination and trust between internal and external stakeholders of HEIs. This paper contributes to the stimulation of the awareness and interest of researchers and practitioners to leverage blockchain technology in their future work in order to facilitate the digital transformation of higher education.},

  abstract={Humanity now finds itself faced with a range of highly complex problems - such as climate change, the spread of disease, international security, scientific collaborations, product development, and so on - that call upon us to bring together large numbers of experts and stakeholders to deliberate collectively on a global scale. Collocated meetings can however be impractically expensive, severely limit the concurrency and thus breadth of interaction, and are prone to serious dysfunctions such as polarization and hidden profiles. Social media such as email, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and web forums provide unprecedented opportunities for interacting on a massive scale, but have yet to realize their potential for helping people deliberate effectively, typically generating poorly-organized, unsystematic and highly redundant contributions of widely varying quality. Large-scale argumentation systems represent a promising approach for addressing these challenges, by virtue of providing a simple systematic structure that radically reduces redundancy and encourages clarity. This paper will address this important question, discussing (1) the strengths and limitations of current deliberation technologies, and (2) how large-scale argumentation can help address these limitations.},

  abstract={The decision-making process and the development of decision support systems (DSS) have been enhanced by a variety of methods originated from information science, cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence over the past years. Situated visualization (SV) is a method to present data representations in context. Its main characteristic is to display data representations near the data referent. As augmented reality (AR) is becoming more mature, affordable and widespread, using it as a tool for SV becomes feasible in several situations. In addition, it may provide a positive contribution to more effective and efficient decision-making, as the users have contextual, relevant and appropriate information to endorse their choices. As new challenges and opportunities arise, it is important to understand the relevance of intertwining these fields. Based on a literature analysis, this paper addresses and discusses current areas of application, benefits, challenges and opportunities of using SV through AR to visualize data in context and to support a decision-making process and its importance in future DSS.},

  abstract={Ontology is adopted as a standard for knowledge representation and sharing in collaborative design on the semantic Web. Fuzzy ontology is an extension of domain ontology for solving the uncertainty problems. To represent formally the fuzzy knowledge more effectively, this paper proposes a series of fuzzy ontology models that consists of fuzzy domain ontology, using intuitionistic fuzzy set, and fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies, considering semantic relationships between fuzzy concepts, including set relation, order relation and equivalence relation. The fuzzy ontology introduces the fuzzy concepts as values of properties and extends the ordinary relationships to fuzzy relationships and intuitionistic fuzzy relationships. The application, which uses fuzzy ontology to model knowledge of intelligent transportation, shows that these models can overcome the localization of other fuzzy ontology models, and this research facilitates the fuzzy knowledge sharing and reuse on the semantic Web.},

  abstract={Water distribution systems are one of the critical infrastructures and major assets of the water utility in a nation. The infrastructure of the distribution systems consists of resources, treatment plants, reservoirs, distribution lines, and consumers. A sustainable water distribution network management has to take care of accessibility, quality, quantity, and reliability of water. As water is becoming a depleting resource for the coming decades, the regulation and accounting of water in terms of the above four parameters is a critical task. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of a monitoring and controlling framework, capable of automating various stages of the water distribution processes. The current trending technologies such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to track this spatially varying network to collect, process, and analyze the water distribution network attributes and events. In this work, we investigate the role and scope of the IoT technologies in different stages of the water distribution systems. Our survey covers the state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems for the water distribution networks, and the status of IoT architectures for water distribution networks. We explore the existing water distribution systems, providing the necessary background information on the current status. This work also presents an IoT Architecture for Intelligent Water Networks - IoTA4IWNet, for real-time monitoring and control of water distribution networks. We believe that, these components need to be designed and implemented effectively to build a robust water distribution network.},

  abstract={The Industry 4.0 trend speeds up the adoption of a variety of technologies. In modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners. This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity. Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the challenges posed by Industry 5.0.},

However, many data are unusable if they are alone or out of context but a combination of these data can be valuable. This idea is also present in the information gathered by the human senses. The human body uses the senses to gather data about the environment in order to take the best possible decisions taking into consideration the whole environment. Our proposal is based on the same idea. We propose the creation of several subsystems that would simulate the human senses and another subsystem capable to manage them, and take decisions based on the data gathered by all subsystems. In this way, the data gathered by one subsystem would be complemented with the data gathered by the rest of systems as the human body does.},

  abstract={Technologies such as electrification, informatization, and intelligence will reshape the energy form of cities in the future. Energy will become a key link in sustainable development and be integrated into sustainable urban development. Starting from the key elements of the energy system for sustainable urban development, considering urban resource endowment and energy demand, combining future urban forms and technological development, from the perspective of prosumer, a smart energy network ecosystem created by global partners and stakeholders is proposed. The features of the proposed ecosystem are: (1) the wisdom of various participants, the consideration of the renewable energy resources available in urban, and the waste heat and wastewater available in urban are integrated; (2) the integrated integration of smart grid and energy storage applications; considering the integration of big data, artificial intelligence and other technical means are considered; (3) focusing on the energy supply and consumption needs of the prosumers, we will jointly customize the smart energy network ecosystem, realize the complementary use of multiple clean energy sources and the coordinated response of the source, network, and storage to provide fair and diversified comprehensive energy services for urban users. This paper demonstrates the ecosystem's modelling ideas, principles, methods and logical framework. Based on the case of the Smart Otaniemi project in Espoo, Finland, it analyses the implementation plan of the smart energy network's ecosystem to provide support for the sustainable development of urban.},

In our previous research, a web-based intelligent collaborative system was developed to address this challenge based on intelligent computational argumentation. However, two important issues were not resolved in that system: priority of participants and self-conflicting arguments. In this paper, we develop two methods for incorporating priorities of participants into the computational argumentation network: 1) weighted summation and 2) re-assessment of strengths of arguments based on priority of owners of the argument using fuzzy logic inference. In addition, we develop a method for detection of self-conflicting arguments. Incorporation of priority of participants and detection of self-conflicting arguments have strengthen the capability of managing intelligent argumentation network for the web-based collaborative engineering design system developed in our previous research.},

  abstract={On-line collaborative learning is a mature research field that benefits from collaborative activities which can increase learning efficacy. However, collaborative learning approaches are still not beneficial in every e-learning experience because they require people's presence and collaboration is many times difficult to achieve. It is remarkable that collaborative learning resources still suffer from endemic problems, such as the lack of authentic interactivity, user empowerment, social identity and challenge, thus having a negative effect in learner motivation and engagement. To overcome these and other limitations and deficiencies, we propose a new type of learning object named Complex Collaborative Learning Objects to support the virtualization of collaborative sessions with the aim to leverage the knowledge elicited during live sessions of collaborative learning, which are augmented with author-generated information, in order to produce interactive and attractive resources to be played by learners. In order to improve social engagement, during the CC-LO execution, a VCS is animated so learners can observe how avatars discuss and collaborate, how discussion threads grow and how knowledge is been constructed, refined and consolidated. Furthermore, learners can interact with the CC-LO to modify some parameters observing the consequences and assessing their understanding. The research reported in this paper is currently undertaken within a FP7 European project called ALICE.},

  abstract={Intelligent networks with the associated user-interaction modalities (human-centric mechanisms) should be helping humans in their everyday activities by actively promoting human control, safety, ethics, and well-being. With intelligent networks' growing role, from facilitators in support of humans' lives and well-being to the future role as systems “designing relations between humans and the world”, their design will determine to a greater extent the character of the way humans' live their lives. At the same time, the rapid evolution of intelligent network technologies has ever more profound implications for humans and societies, and has triggered visions and initiatives to re-align the Next-Generation networks with what works for humans and humanity first. However, there is a mismatch between higher-level design intentions and reality in the context of human-centric intelligent network infrastructure, which calls for a shift and re-alignment of how human-centred theory is translated into technical configurations and practise. This P.h.D project outline investigates how future technology roadmaps can intertwine human-centric theory with the inner mechanics of IoT system technologies. In future research phases, innovation scenarios and breakthroughs are explored to direct the recommended technical specifications toward what is desirable for humanity's well-being that genuinely enhances human empowerment, with greater degrees of inclusivity, meaningful human control, and involvement. Finally, a recommendation for how to technically translate the humanity-centred network infrastructure in practise, will be investigated.},

  abstract={In order to overcome the potential problems during design modification and reuse, it is necessary to record the design intent as an explicit part of the design thinking process and execute consistency maintenance of the design thinking process. This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design activities and decisions but also the design intents behind them. Based on this model, two types of inconsistency in design thinking process are identified. The implementation of consistency check and maintenance is based on assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS).},

  abstract={As each day passes by the world’s NT requirements increase due to increasing population and technological advancements. Currently, traditional technologies are inadequate to support the requirement. It is vital to investigate cost-effective and suitable green environmental technologies as a response. Future connectivity(5G, 6G), programming, artificial intelligence and new technologies might be a resolution to this resource crisis in this setting. Now, choosing amongst the most suitable option present itself as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) challenge in which a judgment must be made in terms of a wide variety of characteristics. In this paper, the extended MCDM strategies are proposed to optimizing new technologies implementation. The novelty of the Fuzzy Hypersoft (FHS) set is discussed, which can deal with uncertainties, vagueness, and unclear data. This framework is more flexible than the structures found in literature as it can deal with the information where the attributes can be further sub-partitioned into attribute values for a better understanding. It may not always be possible to analyze these criteria using precise figures; instead, an assessment must be made using human and expert judgments for a more adaptable and sensitive review. The adaptive MCDM design with fuzzy edges incorporates Entropy (EN), Similarity Measure (SIM), and TOPSIS techniques rely on FHS. The conveyed frameworks are better for probing NT issues because they analyze a more expansive range of attributes, which can handle a component with multiple different sub-attribute values. Expert ratings are used to demonstrate a practical application to highlight the relevance of the proposed approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the impact of primary criterion weights in sorting.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is the trend of today's industry. It integrates many new technologies such as Big data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, etc. One of the main important areas that are affected by this revolution is the manufacturing sectors. These technologies exist in the industrial field, and they have already served to upgrade the manufacturing process and to put it on the path of digitalization. Therefore, a new concept for smart manufacturing systems that are currently in use, who is the Digital Twin (DT) for manufacturing. It is a virtual reflection of a real element. It can be used to check the flexibility of the manufacturing layout, reproduce complex manufacturing systems and evaluate production efficiency in real time. The DT system allows us to test virtual scenarios, optimize and improve working conditions. It predict also what will happen in the real world. The application of DTs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is an important task. It has many advantages to improve the real-time status of machines and products. It ensures also, the continuity between the different areas of industry. The deployment of this concept in the manufacturing sector of an SME, requires the identification of techniques already deployed in the literature. In this paper, the main techniques used in the four layers of DTs, such as the cyber layer, the computing layer, physical layer, and the service layer are reviewed in detail. Their requirements and proposed solutions are also discussed. Another focus, is to provide a framework for the development of DTs for SMEs. On the basis of this framework, we focus on minimizing the costs of digitization. In future works, we aim to implement the proposed framework.},

  abstract={Semantic interoperability among heterogeneous information sources continues to pose enormous challenges to the collaborative design and other communities. In this paper a two-level ontology framework to resolving semantic conflicts in data exchange process is proposed. The top-level ontology defines generic application domain mediation concepts while task-level ontologies represent domain-related understanding. They are connected by semantic mappings, which provide top-level ontology as a mediator by translating the local schema to a common data model. A semi-automatic procedure that assists users to discover plausible semantic relationships between two types of ontology is introduced. Finally, we give an example from a product design scenario, which XML and RDF are chosen as standard syntax and semantic representing language respectively relying on the description and reasoning capabilities.},

This work proposes a DT system, based on automated DT creation and flexible communication across platforms to realize tool independence and to allow interchangeability of the included web-deployment and simulation environments. We apply the approach to the gearbox assembly process in an industrial use case, using the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as a common digital asset definition both for a simulation environment and a robot control program.

  pages={7143-7155},
  abstract={Facial action units (AUs) analysis plays an important role in facial expression recognition (FER). Existing deep spectral convolutional networks (DSCNs) have made encouraging performance for FER based on a set of facial local regions and a predefined graph structure. However, these regions do not have close relationships to AUs, and DSCNs cannot model the dynamic spatial dependencies of these regions for estimating different facial expressions. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel double dynamic relationships graph convolutional network (DDRGCN) to learn the strength of the edges in the facial graph by a trainable weighted adjacency matrix. We construct facial graph data by 20 regions of interest (ROIs) guided by different facial AUs. Furthermore, we devise an efficient graph convolutional network in which the inherent dependencies of vertices in the facial graph can be learned automatically during network training. Notably, the proposed model only has 110K parameters and 0.48MB model size, which is significantly less than most existing methods. Experiments on four widely-used FER datasets demonstrate that the proposed dynamic relationships graph network achieves superior results compared to existing light-weight networks, not just in terms of accuracy but also model size and speed.},

  abstract={This paper presents AppealNet, a novel edge/cloud collaborative architecture that runs deep learning (DL) tasks more efficiently than state-of-the-art solutions. For a given input, AppealNet accurately predicts on-the-fly whether it can be successfully processed by the DL model deployed on the resource-constrained edge device, and if not, appeals to the more powerful DL model deployed at the cloud. This is achieved by employing a two-head neural network architecture that explicitly takes inference difficulty into consideration and optimizes the tradeoff between accuracy and computation/communication cost of the edge/cloud collaborative architecture. Experimental results on several image classification datasets show up to more than 40% energy savings compared to existing techniques without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract={This study explores the feasibility of allocating finite resources beyond fifth generation networks for extended reality applications through the implementation of enhanced security measures via offloading analysis (RLIS). The quantification of resources is facilitated through the utilization of parameters, namely energy, capacity, and power, which are equipped with proximity constraints. These constraints are then integrated with activation functions in both multilayer perceptron and long short term memory models. Furthermore, the system model has been developed using vision-based computing, which involves managing data queues in terms of waiting periods to minimize congestion for data transmission with limited resources. The major significance of the proposed method is to utilize allocated spectrums for future generation networks by allocating necessary resources and therefore high usage of resources by all users can be avoided. In addition the advantage of the proposed method is secure the networks that operate beyond 5G where more number of users will try to share the allocated resources that needs to be provided with high security conditions.},

  abstract={As the demand for machine learning, edge computing, and the Internet of Things technology increases, computing efficiency and energy consumption has become an important basis for computing choices. Although the graphics processing unit(GPU) has a high degree of parallel computing capability, its energy consumption is large, and the data transmission is limited by the system bus bandwidth. Therefore, our laboratory previously proposed the Brain Memory Architecture prototype architecture, which integrates FPGA and memory as a computing architecture, which has the advantages of high-efficiency, and low-power computing and does not require data exchange through the system bus. Based on this prototype architecture, this paper constructs the Brain Memory Architecture HW/SW Co-Design Platform (BMCD platform) to provide a good user interface so that users can easily build a hardware and software collaborative design computing environment. Through the library provided by the platform to establish the data transmission and calculation between acceleration hardware and memory to solve the bandwidth limitation of the traditional system bus. In this platform, the AXI4-stream interconnect core is provided as a standard interface for data handshaking with acceleration hardware, which reduces user design complexity and maintains the scalability of connection with other computing IP cores. In platform evaluation, design and adaptive CNN algorithm for hardware and software design platform, provide data quantization methods to reduce data bits to reduce the required data bandwidth and storage space and propose a dynamic adjustment algorithm for integer and decimal ratios to correct the accuracy and design problems that may be caused by data quantization. With this adaptive CNN algorithm architecture and BMCD platform to construct a rapid data transmission. This paper finally analyzes the comparison of the weight transmission time of different CNN models with the CPU and the GPU. The method proposed in this paper can reach about 20 times faster than the CPU and about 10 times faster than the GPU.},

A total of 60 experienced nurses participated in an iterative design of an interactive graphical interface for remote behavior monitoring. Results of the study indicate that usability of the system improves over multiple iterations of participatory design.

  year={2020},
  volume={50},

  pages={434-443},
  abstract={Choosing adequate gestures for touchless interfaces is a challenging task that has a direct impact on human-computer interaction. Such gestures are commonly determined by the designer, ad-hoc, rule-based, or agreement-based methods. Previous approaches to assess agreement grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this article, we propose a generalized framework that inherently incorporates the gesture descriptors into the agreement analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, we represent gestures using binary description vectors and allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as soft agreement rate (SAR) to measure the level of agreement and provide a mathematical justification for this metric. Furthermore, we perform computational experiments to study the behavior of SAR and demonstrate that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our method is evaluated and tested through a guessability study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR is 2.64 times higher than the previous metrics. Finally, we show that our approach complements the existing agreement techniques by generating an artificial lexicon based on the most agreed properties.},

  abstract={As human beings, we have the inherent bias towards our likes and dislikes. These likes and dislikes are influenced by our psychographic attributes, morals, values, beliefs and societal networks in both circles of influence and circles of concern. We continuously consume products, services as well as produce products and services for others to consume. Due to our inherent bias of likes and dislikes, we unintentionally or intentionally end up liking products and/or services that are personalized for us, or somehow unintentionally match our likes. This personalization makes our lives easier and more comfortable as it may save time, and/or enable us to achieve desired experiences. This personalization is influenced by the data gathered about us directly or indirectly. The richer the data is about us, the more personalized products and services we receive, thereby saving us time and money whilst meeting our desired goals for experience or exchange of value for the offers we are wanting. We remain forever concerned about the direct or accidental use of our data that can fall into the hands of nefarious users of the dark web, or criminals who can cause us all kinds of harm using the data we shared. Herein lies the paradox of personalization and privacy. To solve this paradox, we acknowledge that there has to be a trade-off between data privacy and personalization, and an optimized match on trust, value etc. between the data owners (data subjects) and data buyers. In this paper, we propose approaches to handle these trade-offs in an optimized way with the acceptance threshold determined by a methodology to optimize the match between trust and value perceptions specific to an individual, and in context of the trust we place on the data controller, processor or buyer entity with which we share and entrust our data for the exchange of value provided.},

I discuss why participation of stakeholders in the design of such technology is essential, but also needs to evolve to recognise its political dimension. Possible pathways for such a re-politicising of participation in design are discussed with concepts of Agonistic Design, Critical Design and Design in Use. Alongside these methodological concerns, I argue, it is necessary to also rethink our underlying theoretical understanding of the relationship between humans and technology. To reflect the intimate entanglement, I propose to look at post-humanist theories and new materialism. The goal of this position paper is to provoke discussion and critical reflection.},

  abstract={This paper explores human-building interaction as an active factor in the early stages of the design process. Current design methods allow a range of highly sophisticated tools to measure and analyze quantitative design parameters such as structural, thermal, lighting performance and more. However, interpreting human preferences and occupant behaviour as metrics to inform early design stages remains largely unexplored. Game engines’ are examined for their capacity to steer the design process and embed performance data. Furthermore, the virtual environments they enable are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively as tools for engaging with user preferences. The resultant metrics are then exported into architectural design software to be used as tools by the designer. Finally, the present context in which game engines are applied in architectural design is examined. The paper proposes a framework that enables non-designers to participate in a data-driven, performance-aware participatory environment actively is created and ready for data collection. Components of the platform include direct and indirect user feedback that enable designers to understand user preferences and quantify its qualitative features. Finally, a case study is presented using the developed platform to design high-performance facade panels.},

However, most of these measures cannot be computed on the fly using the available Wikipedia API. Therefore, we have designed an open architecture called WikiReactive to compute incrementally and maintain several aggregated measures on the French Wikipedia. This aggregated data is available as a Web Service and can be used to overlay information on Wikipedia articles through Wikipedia Skins or for new services for Wikipedians or people studying Wikipedia.

Given this scenario, there is a crucial need to educate the people, especially children, who represent the future of society. This study presents a mobile serious game proposal, called “Protecting the Earth”, about selective waste collection, recycling, reduction of waste production and waste reuse in different game stages with focuses in childish public. The methodology adopted included Systematic Review; application of Participatory Design methods, such as the Context Inquiry technique; specification of functional and non-functional requirements and the study of technologies appropriate for developing the project. Experiments were conducted with children aiming to assess the proposed tool's interface. The results obtained by means of usability testing with users showed the need for adjustments in the interface in order to achieve greater accessibility and user satisfaction, and were met immediately. The next step is to perform learning evaluation experiments in order to verify if the proposed serious game is collaborating to acquire user knowledge about the study object (Environmental Education).},

  year={2012},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={A substantial amount of subjectivity is involved in how people use language and conceptualize the world. Computational methods and formal representations of knowledge usually neglect this kind of individual variation. We have developed a novel method, Grounded Intersubjective Concept Analysis (GICA), for the analysis and visualization of individual differences in language use and conceptualization. The GICA method first employs a conceptual survey or a text mining step to elicit from varied groups of individuals the particular ways in which terms and associated concepts are used among the individuals. The subsequent analysis and visualization reveals potential underlying groupings of subjects, objects and contexts. One way of viewing the GICA method is to compare it with the traditional word space models. In the word space models, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), statistical analysis of word-context matrices reveals latent information. A common approach is to analyze term-document matrices in the analysis. The GICA method extends the basic idea of the traditional term-document matrix analysis to include a third dimension of different individuals. This leads to a formation of a third-order tensor of size subjects × objects × contexts. Through flattening into a matrix, these subject-object-context (SOC) tensors can again be analyzed using various computational methods including principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA) or any existing or future method suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In order to demonstrate the use of the GICA method, we present the results of two case studies. In the first case, GICA of health-related concepts is conducted. In the second one, the State of the Union addresses by US presidents are analyzed. In these case studies, we apply multidimensional scaling (MDS), the self-organizing map (SOM) and Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) as specific data analysis methods within the overall GICA method. The GICA method can be used, for instance, to support education of heterogeneous audiences, public planning processes and participatory design, conflict resolution, environmental problem solving, interprofessional and interdisciplinary communication, product development processes, mergers of organizations, and building enhanced knowledge representations in semantic web.},

This can be seen as in the instance of applying the methodology of value-sensitive design (VSD). However, with PIT, there are a number of correlated concepts: having established the value that is in the public interest to be monitored, measured or maintained, it is necessary to identify and design for expectations, accountability, and reflexivity. In this article, we present a conceptual model of concepts involved in public interest technology design, and specify a metaplatform that could be used to implement such designs. We conclude by arguing that this approach supports participatory design involving all the stakeholders impacted by PIT, which, if seen to the product of both joint design and joint debate, would be more likely to be accepted, used, and trusted by communities.},

In the case of education, this has led to a transformation of the educational experience of teachers and students. However, not all are equally prepared to take advantage of it. To explore ways to contribute to the mitigation of this problem, inspired by participatory design techniques, we conducted a series of activities with teachers and students. After a qualitative analysis of the results, a model for the successful technological mediation of the teaching and learning processes emerged, which we call FORTAGONO. In this document we present this model and its evolution. We also discuss its benefits and limitations, and talk about our future work to develop a framework of use.},

  abstract={A key challenge in human-robot interaction (HRI) design is to create and sustain engaging social interactions. This paper argues that improvisational techniques from the performing arts can address this challenge. Contrary to the ways in which improvisation is generally used in social robotics, we propose an understanding of improvisational techniques as based on rules that shape motion choices. We claim that such an approach, represented in what we name the “external” and “emergent” perspectives on improvisation, could benefit the way in which robot movement and behaviour is designed and deployed, increasing playful engagement and responsiveness. As an example of this type of improvisation, we discuss how American dancer and choreographer William Forsythe's Improvisation Technologies could be used in an HRI context. We also report on a preliminary experimentation using a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory prototyping system and a participatory design method with professional dancers geared towards the exploration of interactive movement possibilities with a Pepperrobot. Finally, we report on how this workshop offered valuable information about the applicability of these tools, as well as reflections on how it could help increase the level of engagement in the interaction.},

  abstract={Digital twins are quickly becoming a popular tool in several domains, taking advantage of recent advancements in the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Big Data, while being used by both the industry sector and the research community. In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.},

  pages={17-27},
  abstract={The digitization of smart grid distributed generation and industrial control systems has prompted utilities to deploy tools with ubiquitous communications that potentially widen the attack surface. The utilities still continue to rely on the traditional cybersecurity technologies, such as firewalls, anti-malware tools, and passwords that do not ensure security across all dimensions of the information assurance model required for a strong cybersecurity business process. This paper proposes a multidimensional holistic framework that addresses this gap through advanced technologies, intelligent algorithms, and continued assessments. To show proof, the layered defense model, a solution dimension of the framework, is integrated into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Security and Resilience Testbed to replicate a utility's enterprise and substation networks. The model is used to evaluate the security and resilience of microgrid control systems, and, based on the insights gathered, recommend best practices for utility cybersecurity analysts for a strong business process. With this baseline, the paper conceptually introduces intelligence-driven solutions comprising contextual data analysis and machine learning to respond to advanced persistent threats sponsored by campaign efforts.},

  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={229-238},
  abstract={Online feature request management systems are popular tools for gathering stakeholder requirements during system evolution. Deciding which feature requests require attention and how much upfront analysis to perform on them is an important problem in this context: too little upfront analysis may result in inadequate functionalities being developed, costly changes, and wasted development effort; too much upfront analysis is a waste of time and resources. Early predictions about which feature requests are most likely to fail due to insufficient or inadequate upfront analysis could facilitate such decisions. Our objective is to study whether it is possible to make such predictions automatically from the characteristics of the online discussions on feature requests. The paper presents a tool-implemented framework that automatically constructs failure prediction models using machine-learning classification algorithms and compares the performance of the different techniques for the Firefox and Netbeans projects. The comparison relies on a cost-benefit model for assessing the value of additional upfront analysis. In this model, the value of additional upfront analysis depends on its probability of success in preventing failures and on the relative cost of the failures it prevents compared to its own cost. We show that for reasonable estimations of these two parameters automated prediction models provide more value than a set of baselines for some failure types and projects. This suggests that automated failure prediction during online requirements elicitation may be a promising approach for guiding requirements engineering efforts in online settings.},

  pages={151-161},
  abstract={Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.},

  abstract={Pick your favorite complex societal issue. For example, how could the US government, its citizens, and its energy companies reach an acceptable future national US energy plan? How could such a complex problem even be approached in a rational and transparent manner? We discuss a recently developed Internet-based method for clarifying issues, providing insights into understanding causes of conflict in large stakeholder groups facing complex issues, and reaching consent. This method has been tested on a variety of complex social and technical issues that illustrate how the Internet can be used to harness the collective intelligence of large stakeholder groups. This work further shows how to positively influence the capability of large stakeholder networks to make more informed decisions. As our main objective, we outline the key open research questions for applying Internet based collective intelligence methods in very large stakeholder networks. As a case study we examine what it would take to develop "the lay of the land" of possibly millions of stakeholders for the possible future US energy systems. We discuss stakeholder access issues, inherent conflict of interest issues, as well as the necessary machine automation of the collective intelligence method to handle this scale of stakeholder involvement.},

  pages={573-579},
  abstract={This study is part of a larger project that wants to foster social initiation behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We approach this through a full-body interactive Mixed Reality (MR) experience that mediates a face-to-face play session between an ASD child and a non-ASD child. The goal of this study is to obtain a data model that allows us to evaluate the goodness of the MR system compared to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools (in this case LEGO bricks) which acts as the control condition. In this paper we present our first analysis of the arousal generated by the MR experience compared to that generated in the control condition. We address this by analyzing psychophysiological data recorded during the social interaction behaviors in the ASD child while playing with the non-ASD child. We followed a repeated-measures design with two conditions: our full-body interaction MR environment and the typical social intervention strategy based on LEGO bricks. To measure physiology, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Accelerometer (ACC) data were acquired through a wearable designed by our lab. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the huge amount of multimodal data from the ASD children obtained during 18 trials (3 female and 15 male). As a result, we were capable of classifying social initiation behaviors of ASD children during the MR environment sessions and those occurring during the LEGO construction sessions based on the psycho-physiological data sources. This is a first sign showing that our MR system has specific properties, compared to a traditional construction-based intervention, which potentially provide a new interesting context to intervention in ASD.},

  abstract={This article provides an integrative research model that integrates environmental, organizational, and technical capacity components to analyze theinfluence of cloud computing and deep learning adoption on company commitment. This study examines firms at various business factors to identify critical organizational characteristics that positively drive influence cloud computing appraisal and deep learning. In this context, a literature review on technological innovation features is conducted to recognize potential gaps in ongoing research. Cloud computing is altering the way goods are developed, allowing for greater collaboration between corporate IT and other business divisions such as sales, finance, and forecasting, and encouraging increased customerinvolvement, even to the point of collaboratively designing products with customers. The unique insights provided by the findings can aid businesses in improving their cloud computing usage and deeplearning. Big data and machine-learning capabilities are becoming more available from cloud computing, in addition to primary processing and storage. Due to the relationship between deep learning and the cloud, the firm gains competitive advantages that speed up processes and procedures, placing it on par with the market's key competitors and making it more strategically competitive and technologically well-organized. However, deep learning with the cloud cantransform business in productivity and efficiency to fulfil its commitment. This collaboration increases the company's ability to identify commercial opportunities by offering a comprehensive, well-defined, aggressive, and limitless (thanks to the cloud) database to manageand use strategically. Furthermore, the relationship between deep learning and cloud computing has acommercial impact since it enables automatic transaction identification and allocation, anomalydetection, and the ongoing development of predictive solutions. A cloud environment learns from the data itgathers, makes predictions, and fixes possible issuesbefore the user even realises they exist. These developments lead the company to recognise that cloudcomputing and deep learning are becoming increasingly entwined.},

Analysing data in real-time will assist knowledge seekers and researchers in timely access hence quick approach to solutions. We propose a web based, low-cost and user-friendly health information dissemination tool based on machine learning algorithms that analyses full-text publications sequentially and cluster related documents for ease of access. Information retrieval aspect of the model is enhanced through use of a semi-supervised approach that optimises topic selections during search operations.

  abstract={The more complex the processes, the higher the need for process transparency through high-quality real-time data. The steady improvement of Internet-of-Things technologies, or of the recently phrased cyber physical systems, during the last years ensures this process transparency. Although these technologies are promising, the potential of IoT/CPS technologies is not yet fully applied in practice. One reason is that technology novices have difficulties participating in development processes and consequently prevent case-specific and relevant services from being described. This paper presents an adaptive interface approach to support the development and utilization of IoT solutions. An exemplary solution is presented based on an IoT toolkit with a GUI for configuration, making service development possible without coding skills. Based on experiment observations, design improvements of the GUI are implemented. Furthermore, a more sophisticated design is introduced. This will allow users with different competence levels to improve their interaction with sensor and actuator networks further; consequently, more appropriate solutions can be developed and used.},

  abstract={Complex products and increasing domain specialization have led to a collaborative design environment in which multiple partners are relied upon to successfully realize a product. In such an environment there is a need for computational frameworks that assist in communicating decision making knowledge. In this research a Decision Support Ontology (DSO) is developed to facilitate decision making within collaborative design. The structure of the information model developed reflects a priori knowledge of decision making and supports the communication of information independent of any specific decision method. Accordingly, the DSO includes decision-related information such as the design issue, alternatives, evaluation, criteria and preferences. It also includes decision rationale and assumptions, as well as any constraints created by the decision and the decision outcome. The DSO is built upon the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which facilitates the sharing and integration of decision-making information between multiple collaborators via the Web and Description Logic. Although the information model developed is based on engineering design literature, the DSO captures generic decision information, and therefore could be adapted to be used beyond the engineering design domain.},

  abstract={Employee data is increasingly becoming crucial for organisations to improve workflow and foresight. Furthermore, with the onset of the GDPR law, the MyData movement is pushing for human-centric personal data. This presents an opportunity not only to improve how employees can understand their data, but also have transparency and control over it. This paper investigates how a collaborative design process was used at a technology consultancy company to design a service aimed at enabling data transparency and control as well as at communicating its value. We collected qualitative data from a survey, interviews, and workshops conducted with employees. We then built a prototype and tested its usability using a questionnaire. Results showed a clear need among participants for transparency. Results also showed the effectiveness of the prototype in positively enhancing transparency and in generating a good level of usability. The adopted process also led to the formulation of data categories to improve the service's comprehensiveness. Taken together, our results highlight how the proposed model of co-creative design may aid complex transformations in large technology organisations. We provide a set of recommendations in this space and envision future directions for our study.},

  abstract={Computer system ability training is a new trend in computer education. This paper proposed an innovative experimental teaching method of software and hardware collaborative design to better develop students' system view, structure view, engineering view of computers. An FPGA-based CNN accelerator was designed to combining the knowledge from software to compilation and then to hardware. The main innovations are: (1) Innovation of experimental system: A “curriculum tree” based on knowledge map was built to identify the implicit relationship between software and hardware knowledge. The curriculum was changed from Horizontal Teaching to Vertical Teaching in order to reduce the difficulties of cultivating system ability; (2) Innovation of experiment contents: it proposed an experiment teaching strategy of “Managing Complexity With Simplicity” guided by Occam's razor and used some effective methods to simply the system knowledge of each course around the top-level goals; (3) Innovation of experiment methods: a procedural and flow-based experiment model based on hierarchical experimental contents was used to achieve spiral progressive learning from software design to hardware simulation and then to system development; @Innovation of experiment platforms: an innovative method of conducting experiments, MODE (MODE = Experiment + MOOC) was proposed to allow students to do experiments “anytime, anywhere and on demand”.},

  abstract={Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an efficient recognition algorithm used in pattern recognition, image processing, etc. The problem of how to build an efficient computational system for CNNs has become a pressing one, which is traditionally achieved by software optimization or hardware accelerator design. In contrast, this paper argues that software algorithms and hardware architectures affect each other in neural network applications with a high degree of coupling. In this paper, we propose a software and hardware-based co-optimization design to improve CNNs’ processing efficiency by co-optimization of software and hardware. First, a modular analysis and collaborative design are carried out for the ShuffleNetV2 model by implementing quantization and improving the computational unit. Second, the model is optimized based on reconfigurable computing devices for its characteristics. Third, 8 bit quantization is implemented, while the depth-separable convolution operation and channel selection module is redesigned to make the module perform operations in a hardware-friendly form. The experimental work was carried out on the FPGA platform Xilin xzynqxc-7Z045 using High Level Synthesis (HLS). The experimental results show that the optimized model has a significant improvement in terms of resource utilization and latency.},

  pages={235-240},
  abstract={Attention mechanisms form the basis of providing temporal explanations for a variety of state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures. However, evidence is lacking that attention mechanisms are capable of providing sufficiently valid medical explanations. In this study we focus on the quality of temporal explanations for the medical problem of adverse drug event (ADE) prediction by comparing explanations globally and locally provided by an attention-based RNN architecture against those provided by more a more basic RNN using the post-hoc SHAP framework, a popular alternative option which adheres to several desirable explainability properties. The validity of this comparison is supported by medical expert knowledge gathered for the purpose of this study. This investigation has uncovered that these explanation methods both possess appropriateness for ADE explanations and may be used complementarily, due to SHAP providing more clinically appropriate global explanations and attention mechanisms capturing more clinically appropriate local explanations. Additional feedback from medical experts reveal that SHAP may be more applicable to real-time clinical encounters, in which efficiency must be prioritised, over attention explanations which possess properties more appropriate for offline analyses.},

  abstract={Autonomous robotic systems are being proposed for use in hazardous environments, often to reduce the risks to human workers. In the immediate future, it is likely that human workers will continue to use and direct these autonomous robots, much like other computerised tools but with more sophisticated decision-making. Therefore, one important area on which to focus engineering effort is ensuring that these users trust the system. Recent literature suggests that explainability is closely related to how trustworthy a system is. Like safety and security properties, explainability should be designed into a system, instead of being added afterwards. This paper presents an abstract architecture that supports an autonomous system explaining its behaviour (explainable autonomy), providing a design template for implementing explainable autonomous systems. We present a worked example of how our architecture could be applied in the civil nuclear industry, where both workers and regulators need to trust the system’s decision-making capabilities.},

  abstract={Developing an infrastructure for efficiently coordinating a group of autonomous robots has become a challenging need in robotics community. In recent years, the use of teams of coordinated mobile robots has been explored in several application fields such as military, exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue missions. For such fields, the use of multiple robots enable for robustness at mission accomplishment. In this paper we present a service-oriented, distributed architecture for coordinating a set of mobile robots on the way to a common goal. The main design aspects concern the ease of extendibility, scalability, re-usability and integration of rapidly changing robotic hardware and software, and the support of different application domains rather than limiting to specific tasks' requirements and algorithms. We integrate state of the art ideas such as Service-Oriented Robotics in order to achieve novel solutions. We demonstrate working cooperative autonomous operations using multiple robots with time-suitable communications. This work is an early phase of our ultimate goal, which is to have multiple heterogeneous autonomous robots forming an intelligent system that can be able to deal with highly dynamic and challenging environments such as a first responders team in search and rescue missions.},

  abstract={Existing Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks (EAF) focus on the governance and alignment of an enterprise's strategic business plans and operating model with its Information Technology (IT) capabilities. These technically-oriented processes attempt to simplify the verification and validation of design artifacts used during software development. Yet, many EA projects fail mostly for non-technical reasons. The development of an EA can necessitate organizational change which can influence stakeholder behavior in ways that may be detrimental to the EA. An analysis of EAFs finds that they are deficient in incorporating human behavior and that they avoid any of the consequences of human action during EA development. This paper proposes a behavior-driven EA requirements quality management program designed to encourage stakeholder collaboration and participation in EA.},

  abstract={In recent times, blockchain has received a lot of exposure due to its increased usage in many fields. Blockchain is a decentralized and open ledger that contains information on transactions. It works as an underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and others. It eliminates the double-spending problem by implementing the digital signature mechanism. Blockchain technology has evolved to address the confidentiality and other technical issues that come with using distributed databases. It offers a decentralized environment for processing the transactions, establishes trust among the nodes participating in the network, and also removes the use of central third-party authority. The blockchain contains information on every transaction and is completely change-resistant. It offers peer-to-peer networks in which all nodes are able to validate the transactions happening in the network using a consensus mechanism. This is a very revolutionary technology that has been developed and widely used in a variety of fields. But still having some challenges like security, privacy, storage, scalability, latency, higher consumption of energy, and others. In this paper, the two popular open-source tools for blockchain technology are presented: Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Ethereum is public and permissionless platform whereas Hyperledger Fabric is private and permissioned. The Transaction life cycle of Ethereum and the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric are discussed.},

  abstract={Inconsistencies, unclear processes, and procedures in most democratic countries' election management, particularly vote-counting, cause mistrust and dispute in election results. This study explores the perceptions and expectations of electoral stakeholders on vote counting and validation processes in different African countries. Employing thematic analysis and using the Activity Theory as a lens, the research identifies key themes, such as technical aspects, accuracy, speed, efficiency, transparency, security, challenges, improvements, and the roles of observers and Election Management Bodies (EMBs). The findings highlight various challenges, such as poor network coverage, insufficient staff training, and corruption, informing the formation of a requirement specification for vote counting and validation systems. Despite potential drawbacks and challenges associated with technology solutions, the study proposes a set of ideal requirements specifications for an accurate, efficient, transparent, and secure election vote counting and validation process. The study contributes to ongoing discussions on transparency, accessibility, and the use of electronic voting systems to enhance electoral accuracy and integrity. It suggests avenues for future research, including evaluating legal and regulatory frameworks, voter education, technical challenges, and alternative technological approaches to vote counting and validation.},

  abstract={Although large companies have progressed in digital transformation (DT) of factories using Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have not progressed enough. However, considering the efficiency and value creation of the entire supply chain, it is important to promote a smart factory in not only large companies but also SMEs. This study examines the success factors and mechanisms based on the case studies of Japanese SMEs that have successfully implemented smart factories. Then, its characteristics are compared with those of large companies. Specifically, in SMEs, where the top management and the factory floor are in close proximity, if the purposes and vision of DT are clear and the top management understands its possibilities and limitations, successful experiences can spread throughout the company through trial and error using an in-house system optimized for the factory floor. This study reveals that the success mechanism makes it easier for SMEs to promote DX than for large companies under certain conditions, which is a new finding and a theoretical contribution. The practical contribution of this study is that it guides SMEs to promote DT in factories in SMEs based on this mechanism.},

  abstract={The modeling of landscape change and socio-ecological systems (SES) tends to ignore the interactions across distance and boundaries. To fill the gap, this research analyzes landscape change by considering the tele-coupling effects at the local scale between Owyhee county and Treasure Valley in Idaho, United States. The spatial distribution of recreational activities in Owyhee county are modeled by Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST). Land use and cover change (LUCC) are simulated using Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN). Results show that the tele-coupling effects have significant impacts on the nature-based recreation in Owyhee county. With the tele-coupling effects, MLPNN has achieved a high overall accuracy and kappa coefficient in LUCC. The findings suggest that the tele-coupling effects should be incorporated into the modeling of landscape change and SES. This study also provides policy implications for land management and stakeholder involvement in accommodating landscape change.},

Three data inputs including RGB, depth videos, and skeleton joint positions were recorded during five physical exercises, specific for low back pain and accurately selected by physicians. For each exercise, the dataset also provides a set of features, specifically defined by the physicians, and relevant to describe its scope. These features, validated with respect to a stereophotogrammetric system, can be analyzed to compute a score for the subject's performance. The dataset also contains an evaluation of the same performance provided by the clinicians, through a clinical questionnaire. The impact of KIMORE has been analyzed by comparing the output obtained by an example of rule and template-based approaches and the clinical score. The dataset presented is intended to be used as a benchmark for human movement assessment in a rehabilitation scenario in order to test the effectiveness and the reliability of different computational approaches. Unlike other existing datasets, the KIMORE merges a large heterogeneous population of 78 subjects, divided into 2 groups with 44 healthy subjects and 34 with motor dysfunctions. It provides the most clinically-relevant features and the clinical score for each exercise.},

  abstract={As the services and requirements of next-generation wireless networks become increasingly diversified, it is estimated that the current frequency bands of mobile network operators (MNOs) will be unable to cope with the immensity of anticipated demands. Due to spectrum scarcity, there has been a growing trend among stakeholders toward identifying practical solutions to make the most productive use of the exclusively allocated bands on a shared basis through spectrum sharing mechanisms. However, due to the technical complexities of these mechanisms, their design presents challenges, as it requires coordination among multiple entities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we begin with a detailed review of the recent literature on spectrum sharing methods, classifying them on the basis of their operational frequency regime—that is, whether they are implemented to operate in licensed bands (e.g., licensed shared access (LSA), spectrum access system (SAS), and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS)) or unlicensed bands (e.g., LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U), licensed assisted access (LAA), MulteFire, and new radio-unlicensed (NR-U)). Then, in order to narrow the gap between the standardization and vendor-specific implementations, we provide a detailed review of the potential implementation scenarios and necessary amendments to legacy cellular networks from the perspective of telecommunication vendors and regulatory bodies. Next, we analyze applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for facilitating spectrum sharing mechanisms and leveraging the full potential of autonomous sharing scenarios. Finally, we conclude the paper by presenting open research challenges, which aim to provide insights into prospective research endeavors.},

  abstract={Non Functional Requirements (NFRs) are relative, so are the conflicts among them. In our previously developed catalogue of NFRs conflicts it can be observed that a number of specific pairs of NFRs are claimed to be in conflicts in some cases but they are also claimed not to be in conflict in the other cases. These relative conflicts occur because the positive or negative relationships among NFRs are not always clear and obvious. These relationships might change depending on the meaning of NFRs within the system being developed. This paper focuses on the application of ontology in managing the relative conflicts among NFRs, particularly the relative conflicts between security and usability requirements. The aim is to develop a framework to identify, characterize, and define corresponding resolution strategies for the security-usability conflicts. This paper thus describes the sureCM framework to manage these conflicts; summarizes the security-usability conflicts ontology; and demonstrates how the ontology will be used as a basis to assist analysts in managing conflicts between security and usability requirements.},

HLA (High level architecture) and Web service make distributed M&S available in a network centric environment, integrating heterogeneous simulations and legacy models. But physical communication and interoperation enabled by HLA need to be enhanced in semantic level. Ontology has natural advantage in building shared knowledge and domain model. It is used to realize semantic interoperability and enable reusability of legacy models. In this paper, collaborative simulation ontology, and a multi-layers ontology structure are introduced. Then we propose ontology based collaborative M&S framework using HLA and web service in complex product design to meet the requirement of modern distributed M&S.},

This paper describes the development and use of an ontology to quickly prune the conceptual design space for cyber-physical systems engineering. The Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory, Metamorph Inc., and Raytheon refined an approach originally piloted on amphibious ground vehicles to determine whether it could be generalized to other product domains. Reducing the design space early in the engineering life cycle enables designers to focus quickly on high-value alternatives to reduce cost and speed development. The OpenMETA tool suite, supported by semantic constructs for model integration, facilitates trades and analysis across the engineering disciplines, including electrical, mechanical, thermal, fluid, and cyber. The ontology developed by the authors and described in this paper provides the semantic underpinnings to encode relationships among design alternatives and quickly visualize these trades.},

  abstract={The emergence of various applications is driving the continuous development of 5G mobile networks as infrastructure. To better support real-time wireless services, the low-latency communication is the current research focus. However, the existing radio resource scheduling methods cannot guarantee the strict delay constraint of the low-latency communication. Therefore, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach of radio spectrum resource scheduling strategy is proposed, which can guarantee the low-latency constraint when spectrum resources are insufficient. The Q-learning algorithm is used to approximate the optimal goal of RL. To speed up the learning, the deep neural network (DNN) is used to train the learning parameters. Simulation results show that the strategy converges quickly and has satisfactory results for mobile networks with a high load of spectrum resources.},

Capturing design intents of an assembly, which include a temporal (dynamic) stages, is even harder. This research work aims to enhance the spatiotemporal mereotopology (STM) based ontology in tune with the contemporary efforts in this research domain. The main idea with such STM ontology is to capture dynamic design intents and develop an integrated data translation framework from Computer Aided Design (CAD) system to a visualization system. This integration framework is intended to enhance design sharing in a collaborative environment. In this paper, the framework is demonstrated with a simple mechanical assembly that includes rotational, reciprocating and linear motions, directly related to dynamic design intents.},

Manufacturing knowledge is one of the most important sources for the efficient and effective support to product design decisions. This paper proposes an ontological approach to analyzing what kinds of manufacturing knowledge the design decisions need. The commonly-used methodology is adopted for the ontology development. The work, firstly, focuses on the identification of all the design activities along with the Pahl and Beitz's engineering design process including planning and task clarification, conceptual design, embodiment design, and detail design. Moreover, related manufacturing knowledge, which are classified into three categories such as machine, material, and manufacturing processes, for design support are also identified along with the identification process of different design activities. Then, the ontology is constructed by using the software Protege and some results are illustrated. Finally, some conclusions and future works are presented.},

  abstract={Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has mobilized the world since the beginning of 2020, and is still globally disturbing our lives. Its diagnosis being usually unclear for doctors, patients are considered as positive cases by default, entailing a costly treatment. It was established that CXR images, i.e., those obtained by chest X-rays, are efficient in COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, automating the CXR image processing for early disease diagnosis is crucial for radiologists. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, used to discriminate between positive and negative cases. In addition, the flip, rotation, zoom and shift operations were used to augment the dataset size. Finally, the model was trained and tested on COVIDx CXR-2 dataset. The respective percentages were: 96.75 for accuracy, 96.99 for precision, 96.50 for recall, 96.98 for sensitivity, 96.52 for specificity and 96.74 for F1-score; which compare very well with state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract={In research, there are more and more successful approaches to operate production plants more resource-efficiently and more productively with the help of reinforcement learning. An important point is the reduction of the energy demand of production plants. Instead of manually implementing complex standby strategies rigidly in a PLC, an intelligent system can train to derive decisions about the optimal energetic state of each component autonomously. Since learning in a virtual environment has decisive advantages, simulation models with sufficient accuracy are necessary. Many of the previous implementations of reinforcement learning approaches in an industrial environment are usually tailored to a specific plant. In particular, the agent's scope of action and its connection to the environment must be adapted manually for a new plant. The presented solution shows an intelligent system which automatically optimizes the virtual learning environment with the support of plant knowledge and adapts the reinforcement learning agent to the respective production plant.},

The objective of the PLM business activity is to manage products across their lifecycles, from cradle to grave. PLM is focused on the product, and holistically brings together many product-related components. For such environments, ontologies could play an important role to ensure semantic interoperability and correct information exchange. But what kinds of ontologies are best suited to fulfil this task. The work presented in this paper overviews some of the prominent ontologies used in product development and explores the usefulness of some typical known ontologies for PLM needs. The ontologies are assessed with respect to some ontology engineering and PLM key criteria. By identifying positive and negative aspects with respect to the previous criteria, we clarify the range of alternatives in creating an ontology devoted to PLM purposes.},

In this paper, an ontology-based intelligent estimation agent, including a CMMI-based project planning ontology and a fuzzy cost estimation mechanism, is proposed for the total project cost estimation. The proposed agent combines the fuzzy inference, capability maturity model integration (CMMI), and the ontology to make cost estimation of the project. Based on the information stored in the CMMI-based project planning ontology predefined by domain experts, the fuzzy cost estimation mechanism infers the total project cost and stored the results to the project estimation repository.

  abstract={As E-business developing, how to friendly and intelligently interact with users in website becomes an important issue. Because of this, the demand of semantic interoperability is expanding too. In order to enhance the collaboration and cooperation of the users and web service providers, this paper proposes a semantic based smart interactive model. The model combines ontology technology. With the help of domain ontology the model is augmented many friendly interactive functions. It is made up of many interactive units. Each of them has consanguineous connections with the domain ontology. Through the relationships of the model and ontology concepts, according to the property connections of each ontology concept, the model achieves the additional functions. The model can be reused expediently. This paper proves the validity of the model through the emulational experiment.},

  abstract={The Corona Virus (COVID 19) pandemic is quickly becoming the world's most deadly disease. The spreading rate is higher and the early detection helps in faster recovery. The existence of COVID 19 in individuals shall be detected using molecular analysis or through radiographs of lungs. As time and test kit are limited RT- PCR is not suitable to test all. The RT- PCR being a time-consuming process, diagnosis using chest radiographs needs no transportation as the modern X-ray systems are digitized. Deep learning takes an edge over other techniques as it deduces the features automatically and performs massively parallel computations. Multiple feature maps will help in accurate prediction. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a Computer Aided Deep Learning System identify and localize COVID-19 virus from other viruses and pneumonia. It helps to detect COVID-19 within a short period of time thereby improving the lifetime of the individuals. SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA benchmark datasets are used to examine the proposed system. Recall, Precision, Accuracy-rate, and F-Measure are the metrics used to prove the integrity of the system.},

  abstract={New inventions and changes in technology and methodologies affect design activity frequently resulting in unpredictable effects on the final design solution, hence on the real outcome - unsatisfactory buildings. To avoid these consequences, it is necessary to store and exploit ever-growing knowledge and experiences that allow these problems to be overcome. An innovative `Abstraction Layer' overlying existing application programs has been introduced to model a Reasoner that verifies the coherence of design solutions. This one has been developed by means of an entity class based on ontologies at semantic level, not data. This paper explains how the Reasoner prototype is linked with usual CAAD and BIM tools in order to demonstrate the insight. This research is mainly related with architectural and construction design - but can also be applied to many sectors.},

  abstract={Requirements are a key factor in determining the success or failure of the system development process. Requirements engineering is a creative problem-solving process whose primary purpose is to enable researchers and practitioners to apply appropriate theories, models, techniques and tools to understand and support the requirements processes more effectively. However, there is a multitude of ways to conduct the requirements engineering process and the quality of the requirements can be greatly influenced by the approaches employed. While consensus exists that no one approach works in all situations, how do practitioners and researchers select the most relevant and appropriate approach(es)? In order to understand this, we argue that a community-based effort is required to organise the plethora of requirements engineering approaches into an ontology. Such a structure would provide an opportunity to identify gaps and to improve the interfaces between approaches. Crowdsourcing the development and validation of such an ontology would facilitate its application across different system types and application domains.},

  abstract={The ultimate ambient intelligent care room environment would be able to sense the needs and preferences of the patients and nurses and adapt itself accordingly. This implies an emerging demand for the integration and exploitation of heterogeneous information available from different technologies. Nowadays, the nurse is responsible for orchestrating all these technologies, which slows down the adoption rate. In this paper, a context-aware, ambient aware and pervasive framework is proposed that tackles this integration problem by using an ontology. Rules, defined on top of this ontology, implement algorithms to optimize and automate care tasks. To increase the acceptance of the new technology, a user-driven development process is used which involves the stakeholders in every step of the design of the ontology and algorithms. To make the framework adaptable to future needs, a self-learning component is introduced that detects trends in the execution of the Rules and adapts the system accordingly.},

  abstract={One of the most critical decision points in collaborative product development is final design concept selection. This crucial stage is considered as a complicated multi-criteria decision-making problem which affects not only the subsequent design stages but the whole product lifecycle and supply chain. In fact, in addition to the fact that it is a knowledge intensive based phase, the information manipulated at this stage is mainly subjective and imprecise. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new fuzzy-ontology based approach to handle the vagueness and subjectivity in design concept evaluation and to support the decision making process at this phase. A case study is given to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract={To realize a simultaneous design of a product and its optimized supply chain, effective integration among design collaborators is a must. With the emergence of ontologies as a new modeling paradigm in industry during the last decade, efficient integration and semantic interoperability among all the inter-actors of the extended enterprise have become attainable. In fact, in addition to their great expressiveness, ontologies can afford many reasoning capabilities. In this paper, a reference ontology, general enough to represent both the product and supply chain data and specific enough to support the decision making process in the simultaneous design phase, has been proposed and implemented. In addition, we have exploited its potentialities through the proposition of a new integrating approach based on the dynamic interaction between ontology and mathematical models of optimization, in order to support interoperability and the optimization process within the simultaneous design of the product and its related supply chain.},

Starting with the Ecology of Resources model of learning, we identify "filters" that limit the adoption of new and hybrid learning processes in formal contexts. The related "boundary" issues of the Theory of Learning for the Mobile Age, are then discussed from a Learner-Generated Contexts Research Group perspective. This enables us to demonstrate that the Open Context Model of Learning could provide a framework by which a co-creation model of learning might enable learning processes, which bridge these traditional learning boundaries. We conclude by arguing that by using an Organizational Architecture of Participation we can identify system processes by which institutions can recognize and mainstream hybrid learning processes and in so doing become "adaptive".},

Based on this method, we then develop a reasoning model on the checking of the conformity of a construction project against technical norms by matching of a representation of a construction project to representations of conformity queries. In order to enrich our model with tacit expert knowledge guiding the checking process, we develop special (semi)formal expert rules based on semantic annotations of conformity queries that schedule the matching operations of the checking process and, thus, make it more effective. Finally, to validate our model, we present the C3R system and discuss its further development to integrate the context knowledge related to non-formalised construction practices.},

Separation of concerns in the aspect oriented software development (AOSD) allows architects to structure and developers to better manage complex systems by mapping the whole system in a multi-concern space and focusing one problem at a time. Certainly, there is a lot of confusion in AOSD about what a concern is. In this context, we defined as more precisely as possible the concern concept in information engineering. From our point of view, a concern is a care of one or more stakeholders involved in the construction or evolution of an information system in its natural environment. In order to make accurate the meaning of the concern concept, in this paper we introduce CONO (CONcerns Ontology), an ontology of the concern concept, which formally describes its meaning as we gave in our definition. Each concern might be described by its high-level specification that is a description formed by the problem specification of the concern and the roles of the stakeholders, which have that concern. The concepts from the high-level specifications constitute the stakeholders' vocabulary and can be used in the construction of an ontology of the new information system.},

  abstract={Through Life Capability Management (TLCM) is a complex evolving domain that requires a new approach to better understand the different viewpoints, models and practices within various enterprises to support a future conceptual model development. This research applied Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to identify the activities necessary to transform an existing aerospace and defence business model to one that would support TLCM. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts and stakeholders across a range of different relevant functions and organisations to identify the activities required to support conceptual model development. A bottom-up approach was used to provide a TLCM ontology and a top-down approach was proposed to develop the root definitions derived from the experts' perception of TLCM. The benefits and drawbacks of using SSM including the human-activity system and mapping the activities onto a TLCM cube (architectural) model are discussed.},

  abstract={The paper addresses system modelling and engineering in cooperative distributed environments. Multi-agent systems, ontologies and web technologies are used for the support and management of resources in a distributed virtual environment. Distributed design involves dispersed heterogeneous teams of people who have to establish and maintain an efficient cooperation process in order to reach global 'optimal' solutions to various problems. Key needs addressed by the introduced multi-agent system refer to inter operation among distributed resources and knowledge sharing, reuse and integration. An ontology library creates a common shared understanding of the domain for inter operating agents. The proposed system employs agents for information storage and retrieval, for enhancing collaboration within a distributed design environment and for providing a suitable interface to the user. The agents offer content-related support to the user by committing to the same library of ontologies. The proposed multi-agent design information management system aims to facilitate the optimization of the solution space of the collective dispersed design team.},

  abstract={The paper introduces the architecture of a multiagent system for environmental monitoring and analysis, and focuses on the use of collaborative intelligence between the environmental agents (the agents that monitor and analyze the evolution of specific environment pollutants concentrations in different locations) and meteorological agents (that provide information about all meteorological parameters that can influence the degree of environmental pollution: temperature, speed of wind, humidity etc). The collaboration between agents is facilitated by asynchronous messaging and a common ontology (that is shared by all agents, environmental and meteorological). Some experimental results obtained for different scenarios of the multi-agent system simulation are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract={In software engineering, one of the process improvement methods is through empirical studies. We compare several empirical studies on ontology engineering to discuss potential empirical works on our domain of interest, namely the learning process improvement. Subsequently, we conduct an assessment on novice modelers to determine the effects of ontology on subjects' learning process. The p-values indicate that there is a significant difference between the group that is provided with ontology (ontology group) and the group that is not (control group). Furthermore, the mean scores for comprehensiveness and confidence in the ontology group are slightly higher than in the control group. We conclude that the use of ontology may positively contribute to the learning process especially with the learners involved in the ontology engineering process.},

Then, collaborative service planning is divided into different stages. And generating algorithm serving planning program is proposed to obtain feasible program collection of service composition.

Responses were automatically classified into 10 different categories, which were derived from a codebook created for the content analysis of the responses. Results show that most responses were classified in the category Local Government Unit (LGU) accountability. The classifier achieved a 93.3% mean accuracy with ten-fold cross validation. This analysis shows that the created classifier module can successfully decode responses and can be further improved by applying multi-label classification. However, the classifier achieved 63.8% agreement with the manual coding, and a revision of the code book may be deemed necessary as a future work. The application of pre-processors such as spelling checkers can also be considered.},

  abstract={A number of developed countries employ ontology in e-government projects. On the other hand, E-government is gaining more and more acceptance in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. However, little work is done in building knowledge base ontologies guaranteeing the integration, maintainability, interoperability and sustainability of applications. In this paper, we present a case study of constructing ontology in support of e-government initiatives for development projects monitoring in a SSA country. Case studies of development projects conducted in different SSA countries as well as related published works in various fields including project management, project monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building are reviewed and the features of the ontology are extracted. The resulting ontology aims at: providing developers of potential e-government applications for development projects monitoring in Sub Saharan Africa and the developing world in large with key concepts and activities of the domain, facilitating communication amongst all the role players involved in development projects implementation by providing a common and shared representation of concepts and activities of the domain, and serving as a knowledge base system to the monitoring and evaluation activities of development projects; thereby, strengthening efficiency, effective and sustainable implementation of development projects in Sub Saharan Africa. Further, the study aims at sensitizing and serving as a practical case study of building ontology in support of e-government adoption processes in Sub Saharan Africa.},

  abstract={The considerable previous work characterizing visualization usage has focused on low-level tasks or interactions and high-level tasks, leaving a gap between them that is not addressed. This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

Without a better understanding of the analysts and their problems, we cannot build visual analytics systems that integrate well with their work processes and truly provide benefit to them. In order to close this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal, observational field study of intelligence analysts in training within the intelligence program at Mercyhurst College. We observed three teams of analysts, each working on an intelligence problem for a ten-week period. Based upon study findings, we describe and characterize processes and methods of intelligence analysis that we observed, make clarifications regarding the processes and practices, and suggest design implications for visual analytics systems for intelligence analysis.},

  abstract={Storyline visualizations are an effective means to present the evolution of plots and reveal the scenic interactions among characters. However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.},

  abstract={Technology-mediated collaboration process has been extensively studied for over a decade. Most applications with collaboration concepts reported in the literature focus on enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-making processes in objective and well-structured workflows. However, relatively few previous studies have investigated the applications of collaboration schemes to problems with subjective and unstructured nature. In this paper, we explore a new intelligent collaboration scheme for fashion design which, by nature, relies heavily on human judgment and creativity. Techniques such as multicriteria decision making, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network (ANN) models are employed. Industrial data sets are used for the analysis. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed scheme exhibits significant improvement over the traditional method in terms of the time-cost effectiveness, and a company interview with design professionals has confirmed its effectiveness and significance.},

This paper contributes by helping to bridge the gap between ethical theory and design practice. To do so, the concept of capability caution in UAV design is introduced. Capability caution in UAV design is the need for setting well-reasoned limits to the technology's capabilities during the design phase, both to limit risks of misuse, but also to enhance performance within the specified application. Five capability caution design principles are developed which should be considered: 1. context of use 2. privacy 3. jobs and human skills 4. safety, security, and misuse, and 5. the future. A Danish healthcare UAV that has been designed using the capability caution design principles is presented to illustrate the approach.},

  abstract={This paper describes a research project that investigated the feasibility of using contextual reasoning to supervise the collaborative work of knowledge workers. In complex projects that require contributions from various experts but whose interaction may be limited to a web-based collaborative tool, proper management of the project is essential to ensure that the project objectives are met. This is typically the job of a project manager. We assert that having situational awareness is likewise essential to managing a project, and we utilize Context-based Reasoning (CxBR) as the tool of choice for implementing situational awareness in an agent that assists project managers. We use rocket design and manufacture as the domain to evaluate our approach. We make use of public domain rocket design software developed by NASA as a guide to the domain. The paper describes the investigation and the related works involved in collaborative design project, as embodied by designing and building a small rocket.},

  abstract={Recent research has focused on the use of ontologies to promote the sharing of knowledge. Ontologies are becoming increasingly important because they provide the critical semantic foundation for the rapidly expanding field of knowledge. They are very useful for knowledge reuse, knowledge sharing, and enterprise modeling. A design ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a design domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base. It can help the collaborative design team by providing accurate design information and guidelines. This research develops a methodology called domain knowledge acquisition process (DKAP) for creating an ontology of product and process design using IDEF5 and generates a consistency matrix for checking the accuracy of captured information. DKAP is a step-by-step methodology, which captures the product & process design knowledge, stores this knowledge in a reusable format, and shares this knowledge across enterprises. DKAP addresses three critical aspects of a design ontology. It explores the availability of similar domain ontologies for reuse, checks the accuracy & consistency of captured knowledge, and allows the sharing of the captured knowledge.},

  abstract={Children with autism often have difficulties in learning the social skills and norms of peer social interaction, which severely affect and limit their social lives. Aiming at addressing this issue, through design, we developed a digital-analogue model playground to help them understand and cope with the socially difficult situations experienced when they go to a physical playground to interact with peers. Based on therapists and parents' insights, we created the model playground with built in collaborative protocols providing immediate feedback to the children in terms of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Our design artefact was evaluated in a rehabilitation clinic for autistic children and demonstrates promising potential for digital-analogue devices as useful resources training peer social interaction. Our findings document that digital-analogue design devices can facilitate the development of social skills and norms through peer learning activities amongst children with autism.},

This paper has been written with motivation to present various ideas of experts and professionals from an academic environment that represent different scientific fields of work such as telecommunications, control engineering, traffic engineering, information and communication technologies, etc. The authors believe that using the case of the University of Žilina (UNIZA) the multidisciplinary and synergic character of the topic may be emphasized sufficiently. Therefore a special content form of the paper has been used, based on the “question-answer” pattern. Traditionally prepared papers usually follow one of two possible lines: integration dimension - from research mono-thematically oriented on one technology only up to the fully integrated approach, or socio-technical dimension- from solution of purely technical problems up to the socio-technical perspectives and position of a human in the whole chain. This paper aims to raise a set of key questions representing the most urgent problems of today's smart city agenda and answers to them.},

  pages={362-368},
  abstract={A critical issue during human-agent and human-robot interaction is eliciting an intentional stance in the human interactor, whereas the human perceives the agent as a fully "intelligent" being with full agency towards their own intentions and desires. Eliciting such a stance, however, has proven elusive, despite work in cognitive science, robotics, and human-computer interaction over the past half-century. Here, we argue for a paradigm shift in our approach to this problem, based on a synthesis of recent evidence from social robotics and digital avatars. In short, in order to trigger an intentional stance in humans, perhaps our artificial agents need to adopt one about themselves.},

  abstract={Digital business transformation (DBT) is a significant trend in all industries, and affects all businesses, large and small. Companies that resist digitalisation and systemic transformation risk losing market share or even completely going out of business. Effective communication, both internal and external, and collaboration are vital for transformation success. This paper investigates executives’ perceptions of the disruptions leading to the need for DBT, whether such a transformation is considered a challenge or even a crisis by company executives, and the communication strategies that are implemented for DBT in various pipe extrusion companies in Germany. This research adopts a qualitative approach and semi-structured interviews were used in our research to gather data from experts in the companies. The research found that most companies in the pipe extrusion industry in Germany acknowledge and can articulate disruptions, both current and future. However, they but do not regard digital transformation of their business as a crisis and most companies have not prepared strategies for effectively communicating their response to digital transformation challenges.},

  year={2023},
  volume={19},
  number={7},
  pages={8362-8373},
  abstract={Nowadays, more data are represented and stored by a graph structure, and subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in a variety of scientific machine learning and industrial applications, such as remote sensing image registration, industrial inspection, etc. Due to the nondeterministic polynominal hard (NP-hard) problem of subgraph matching, the explosive growth of graph data, the disadvantages of high energy consumption, and the high overhead of CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, computing subgraph matching is becoming more and more challenging. To alleviate this problem, we propose a phased hybrid algorithm to accelerate the enumeration task of subgraph matching, called PH-CF, based on the CPU-field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) heterogeneous platform. This approach can make full use of the pipeline and data flow mechanism, low power consumption, and configurable characteristics of FPGA. First, the matching order of query vertices automatically selects GraphQL (GQL) or RI methods according to the sparsity of the data (query) graph. Second, a candidate vertex auxiliary data structure set partitioning method is designed to effectively realize the load balance of multiple computing units at the FPGA and CPU host sides. Third, FPGA's pipeline and data flow mechanism is used to accelerate the enumeration phase of subgraph matching. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the performance of the PH-CF outperforms the state-of-the-arts. PH-CF can obtain the average performance improvement of up to $16.07\times$, $38.61\times$, and $11.46\times$ over CFL, CECI, and DP-iso, respectively. Moreover, our approach has good stability and robustness on various datasets.},

  abstract={To solve the problem that the single robot task execution capability is not enough to meet the whole handling task demand under complex conditions, the hybrid path planning models such as multi-robot path planning and formation cooperative control considering obstacle avoidance are studied. Firstly, for the robot global path finding problem, on the basis of the construction for a robot working environment model based on the geometric map model building method, an improved particle swarm algorithm-based global path planning model is proposed to solve the problems of low robot path planning solution efficiency and easy to fall into local optimal solutions. Secondly, for the multi-robot cooperative formation control and obstacle avoidance and inter-robot collision avoidance problems, a multi-robot formation local path planning model based on the improved artificial potential field method is constructed, a simulated annealing algorithm is introduced to optimize the traditional artificial potential field method, and a multi-robot formation control strategy, robot obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance methods are designed in combination with the pilot-following method to improve the robot formation path exploration The proposed method can improve the path exploration capability and handling efficiency of robot formation. Finally, the global path planning model of the robot based on the improved particle swarm algorithm is simulated and analyzed using Matlab 7.0 to verify the outstanding performance of the model in pathfinding capability. Then the local path planning model of multi-robot formation based on the improved artificial potential field is simulated and analyzed to verify the improved algorithm has good path planning as well as obstacle avoidance performance. The hybrid path planning model is applied to a real case and simulated, and the results show that the improved algorithm improves the exploration capability of the robot formation, effectively avoids obstacles, and verifies its reliability and superiority in the hybrid path planning process.},

  abstract={With the increasing complexity of urban transportation system, serious traffic congestion brings inconvenience to travel. It is also very difficult to predict and control traffic congestion. Therefore, this paper takes urban traffic condition and traffic congestion as the research object, and conducts in-depth research on traffic condition prediction model and traffic congestion control method. Firstly, a traffic state prediction method based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) optimized radial basis function (RBF) and long and short term memory network (LSTM)/ support vector machine (SVM) feature fusion model was proposed for urban traffic state prediction. Experiments were carried out based on the regional traffic data of Shenyang Station, and compared with other algorithms, which verified the superiority of the feature fusion model based on IPSO-RBF and LSTM/SVM in this paper. Secondly, aiming at the problem of urban traffic congestion, a congestion Section control method based on traffic allocation is proposed. Through VISSIM simulation and comparison with other traffic control schemes, the superiority of the congestion Section optimization method proposed in this paper is verified.},

The key technologies, standards, and laws of intelligent remote sensing satellites are also experiencing a series of new challenges. Novel concepts and key technologies in the intelligent hyperspectral remote sensing satellite system have been proposed since 2011. The aim of these intelligent remote sensing satellites is to provide real-time, accurate, and personalized remote sensing information services. This article reviews the current developments in new-generation intelligent remote sensing satellite systems, with a focus on intelligent remote sensing satellite platforms, imaging payloads, onboard processing systems, and other key technological chains. The technological breakthroughs and current defects of intelligence-oriented designs are also analyzed. Intelligent remote sensing satellites collect personalized remote sensing data and information, with real-time data features and information interaction between remote sensing satellites or between satellites and the ground. Such developments will expand the use of remote sensing applications beyond government departments and industrial users to a massive number of individual users. However, this extension faces challenges regarding privacy protection, societal values, and laws regarding the sharing and distribution of data and information.},

  abstract={Care costs of People with Dementia (PwDs) bear a tremendous burden on healthcare systems around the world. Smart Homes (SHs), as an instance of the ambient assisted living technology, can help reduce these expenses. However, only few of the existing studies in the literature discuss how SHs should be designed by considering the unique requirements of PwDs. Most of the studies view dementia care as a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific needs of PwDs. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems to PwDs as well as other stakeholders in the sector of dementia care. The present research reports on the requirements elicitation, design and evaluation of a dedicated SH prototype for PwDs. In contrast to most of the existing SH systems proposed for PwDs, this work presents a tailored prototype that is based on a user-centred design methodology. The preliminary evaluation by a sample of stakeholders shows the suitability of the proposed methodology and consequently the resulting prototype for reducing care difficulties as well as its potential of deployment in the real-world environment.},

  abstract={Research has shown that over half of those with MCI will develop dementia within 5 years. In 2017, approximately 50 million people have dementia in the world. Moreover, dementia is now the 7th leading cause of death. Now almost 600 thousand people aged 65 or over are MCI in Taiwan. The ratio of people aged 65 years or over in Taiwan will reach 20% by 2025. According to the results of several studies, 3-19% of adults over the age of 65 meet the criteria for MCI. The majority of care for PWCI is provided by family carers. Using assistive technologies (AT) to help PWCI live independently can reduce the costs of care for PWCI. AT can support communication, monitor and reminders to meet the requirements of socialization, safety and cognition for PWCI, respectively. In this research, we propose an intelligent cognition assistant (iCA) to improve living qualities for PWCI using modern assistive technologies. The system has three major functions: companion, cognitive rehabilitation and evaluation, and daily activities assistant. A friendly and intelligent dialog interface, digital cognitive exercises, multidimensional cognitive evaluation and activities monitors are provided to achieve these goals.},

  abstract={Designing complex and reasonable 3D environments for modern 3D games is one of the time consuming challenges faced by present video game industry. We have critically reviewed the existing approaches to automate the design of 3D environments. It was identified that current 3D environment generation techniques being specific to one or few types of environments and the lack of customizable frameworks which are common to many types of environments as the main issues to be addressed. According to literature, surprisingly complex and interesting global behaviours can arise in multi agent systems as a result of simple rules that are followed by number of simple agents operate in an environment. We hypothesize that this emergent behaviour of multi agent systems can be used to design 3D game environments with emergence properties that were not visible in initial constituents. The proposed solution provides a multi agent based approach to develop a framework which is common to design many types of 3D game environments. Each 3D model in a 3D game environment is associated with an agent with simple rules and this system allows users to introduce new 3D models and associate them with agent types. The main input for the proposed system is a parameterized description of an imaginary 3D environment. Output of the system is a 3D game environment with self organized 3D models positioned and oriented in most suitable places. The proposed approach has been evaluated by implementing a prototype and comparing the proposed approach with traditional 3D game environment design approaches.},

  pages={000159-000164},
  abstract={Developing a (Consumer) Robotics Product is not easy. Most companies, at least in the domain of industrial robotics, tend to rely on a Technology Push-based methodology. They develope a product as good as they can, trying to include their newest technological breakthroughs. When the product is finished, they advertise and sell it based on its feature set and competitive advantage. Unfortunately, this sometimes doesn't really take into account the desires and needs of (esp.) new markets. Hence, we applied a Market Pull-based approach: Use Case Driven Requirements Engineering (UCD-RE), starting with the analysis of Megatrends to understand future market developments. So far, no earlier evidence of such an approach for the development of a robotics product could be found in literature. As commonly agreed, Megatrends will affect our lives both professionally and in private, bringing huge business opportunities for companies - but only in the long run as their effects are relatively limited in the beginning. Yet, their effects will finally even break down encrusted structures and will make outdated business models obsolete. Therefore, new market entries or established companies that want a strategic reorientation have to focus firstly on the megatrends as they must understand the impact of the changes induced will have on customers. The company then must define which requirements and competencies are needed as well as which conditions have to be fulfilled to provide these customers with solutions resp. products and services. In our paper we outline the following approach: Firstly, we identified the most relevant Megatrends affecting the Consumer Robotics domain, then we derived a Use Case(s) and finally we outlined the overview of the necessary conditions and requirements to ensure a success story.},

  abstract={The objective of a virtual assistant is to use web-based data sources, user-generated content, and knowledge from knowledge libraries. An Intelligent virtual assistant's main purpose is to deliver solutions to users' questions. It is possible to do it in a business setting, like on a company website with a chat interface. Virtual assistant is very helpful especially for elder as well as for people with cognitive disability such as Alzheimer's disease. For someone with physical limitations, a virtual assistant can be very useful. Seniors with poor vision or limited mobility, for example, one can operate the device simply by speaking into it. New techniques of caring for the elderly that include advanced information and communication technology are desperately required. As a percentage of the total population, the world's senior population is rapidly growing, but the fraction of the working population who will create the resources to assist the aged is declining. Voice searches have a number of advantages for elders as well as for cognitive disability such as speed. In fact, voice searches are much faster than written searches. A survey has been carried out in this work in which some questions have been asked from elderly people and people with abnormality or disability. The questions were based on Virtual Assistant. The aim of this task was to evaluate how many people use these assistants in their everyday life. Based on this survey it has been concluded that the prevalence of Virtual Assistants is growing in our day to day lives.},

  title={The Sociotechnical Digital Twin: On the Gap Between Social and Technical Feasibility},
  year={2022},
  volume={01},
  number={},
  pages={11-20},
  abstract={The last five years has seen an exponential increase in interest around the notion of a digital twin. Multiple systematic reviews have established a base set of findings which are now broadly taken as assumptions in the field. The findings have outlined frameworks, integration patterns, distinctions between product and process oriented digital twins, simulation and the leveraging of artificial intelligence to support prediction and optimisation. As the use cases of digital twins have evolved from a predominance in manufacturing and into the sociotechnical domain to support the social world, a gap emerges between the social requirements and the technical machinery of digital twins. This gap is significant and worthy of exploration as it presents important challenges for digital twin research including use of sociotechnical design methods, problems arising from a so-called abstraction gap and various epistemological concerns. This paper proposes an analytical route to ameliorating the sociotechnical gap which is discussed within a future notion of an Environment Digital Twin.},

  pages={2182-2198},
  abstract={As an important source of inspiration, the great number of patent documents provides designers with valuable knowledge of design rationale (DR), including issues, intent, pros and cons of the solutions. Researchers have carried out a number of data analysis studies based on patent information, which is now a new discipline called Patinformatics, including the analysis of patent information from a macro perspective and the identification and extraction of patent knowledge from a micro perspective. If DR knowledge could be extracted automatically from the patent documents and provided to designers as a source of inspiration, it would greatly promote innovative design, and at the same time promote the reuse of patent documents and the wide application of DR theory, which can be like killing three birds with one stone. To address this issue, this study proposes an improved lexical-syntactic pattern method for DR centric patent knowledge extraction, including DR Vector Space model (DRVS), DRV Trigger Word (DRV-TW), Design Rationale Vector (DRV), DR credibility (DRC) and others, and DRV based knowledge extraction algorithms. Knowledge extraction experiments were conducted on 1491 patent documents to verify the feasibility and performance of the method. In addition, two other sets of comparative experiments were conducted using the FastText and BERT machine learning methods, and the results further confirmed the reliability of the proposed method for low-resource corpus.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={115603-115623},
  abstract={The COVID-19 crisis has attracted attention worldwide to supply chain disruptions and resilience. Several supply chain risk management approaches have been revisited or reapplied in the literature; however, collaborative resource sharing is less researched. This study aimed to investigate the current academic state of the art and advances in using collaborative resource sharing as a reactive method to facilitate supply chain recovery in the presence of disruptive events. More specifically we considered the role of different collaborative resource-sharing strategies that organizations can adopt to support supply chain functionalities during times of disruption. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2000 to 2022. In order to analyze the literature, we adopted a combination of text-mining, automatic and manual categorization of selected articles, and exploratory analyses such as cluster analysis and relational indicators. We also consider the machine learning classification algorithm i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering for the categorization of clusters. The findings show that, for disruptive risks, collaborative sharing of labour and material resources is effective for the recovery of supply chains. More so, labour resources tend to contribute more to the recovery of supply chains through the physical and mental recreation of recovery activities and experiences. Whilst information resources and a mix of information and material resources are highly important in reducing the impact of COVID-19 disruptive supply chain risk. In conclusion, collaborating on the three resources, namely labour, material, and information resources can be an effective post-disruption recovery strategy for supply chains.},

  abstract={The study of microstructure of materials is of great significance in the field of materials science. The interdisciplinary cooperation of materials science and computer science makes it more accurate and efficient to explore the relationship between material microstructure and material properties. Machine learning has potential in exploring the relationship between microstructure and properties of materials. This paper proposes adding the morphology features of grains into the construction of grain knowledge graph to enrich the grain information in the graph. First, an autoencoder extracts the grain morphology features and adds them to the grain knowledge graph. Then, the graph convolutional network is used to extract the features of the graph, and the fully connected network is used to predict the properties of the material. Experiments are performed on actual EBSD scanning data. The experimental results show that the proposed method has noticeable improvement over the competing methods.},

  pages={5429-5441},
  abstract={Software Project Management (SPM) is considered the key driver for the success or failure of software projects. Project failure is caused by various factors, the most important of which is poor SPM. Thus, we investigated the needs of practitioners by focusing on Project Management Q&A communities. More precisely, we targeted Stack Exchange to identify the primary needs of software project managers. More than 5000 SPM questions were analyzed from the conceptual model given by the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK. For pre-training of the Machine Learning classifiers, we implemented Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Doc2Vec text embedding and compared their performance. Our results showed that BERT outperforms Doc2Vec for pre-training in almost all scenarios. Schedule management, followed by resource management, are the main PMBOK knowledge areas of concern for project managers. Among the process groups, the emphasis of the questions is on planning. We compared the findings with the learning and training status quo in 11 top Canadian universities. We analyzed 46 SPM-related courses and found that the rank correlation of PMBOK knowledge areas is 0.23 between the key content of the analyzed courses and the focus of Q&A’s knowledge areas analyzed from Stack Exchange.},

  abstract={Many studies have attested to the efficacy of integrating innovative methods of teaching computing and engineering, especially for introductory students and at the K-12 level. As an example, robots have been successfully used to teach a wide range of subjects, from introductory programming to artificial intelligence. As a discipline, wearable computing is seen to be practical, yet futuristic and exciting, and it captures the attention and interest of people who might not otherwise be drawn to technology. Recent developments in this field have also raised the possibility of moving wearable computing construction within the reach of hobbyists and novices. However, there still exist substantial obstacles toward the adoption of wearable computing into education. This paper presents a framework with the objective of facilitating the integration of wearable computing into outreach and introductory computer science and engineering education. We also present a comprehensive evaluation of our platform, including a comparison with the current practice of sewing-based wearable computing.},

  abstract={The ubiquitous presence of software in the products we use, together with Artificial Intelligence in these products, has led to an increasing need for consumer trust. Consumers often lose faith in products, and the lack of Trust propagates to the companies behind them. This is even more so in mission-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and clinical support systems. This paper follows grounded theory principles to elicit knowledge related to Trust, Ethics, and Transparency. We approach these qualities as Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), aiming to build catalogs to subsidize the construction of Socially Responsible Software. The corpus we have used was built on a selected collection of literature on Corporate Social Responsibility, with an emphasis on Business Ethics. Our challenge is how to encode the social perspective knowledge, mainly through the view of Corporate Social Responsibility, on how organizations or institutions achieve trustworthiness. Since our ground perspective is that of NFRs, results are presented by a catalogue of Trust as a Non-Functional Requirement, represented as a Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG). The SIG language helps software engineers in understanding alternatives they have to improve Trust in software products.},

  abstract={In order to confront the challenge of creating robotics with a social impact, this paper speculates on how to allow anybody anywhere hands-on opportunity to make contextualized solutions. Inspired by embodied artificial intelligence and modular robotics, we present the building block approach as a way to achieve user-driven innovation of high tech solutions with a social impact. Modularity invites to physical manipulation and reconfiguration, and in the process of physical manipulation, the user starts understanding and developing the functionality. Through immediate action in the interaction, the user is not only learning about the abstract thinking that the system may represent, but at the same time, the user is able to try the system in new, innovative configurations. Hence, the system becomes a true engine for innovation allowing the user to creatively invent, build and test new developments as the exploration is happening. As instantiations of this building block approach and its social impact, we briefly review the development and use of modular robotic devices for education, health improvements, and business in Africa. We briefly outline the modular building blocks for education, modular interactive tiles for rehabilitation in Tanzania and for soccer tournaments in Africa, Asia and Europe.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={115280-115305},
  abstract={Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising achievements in various computer vision tasks. However, designing a CNN model architecture necessitates a high-domain knowledge expert, which can be difficult for new researchers while solving real-world problems like medical image diagnosis. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an approach to reduce human intervention by automatically designing CNN architecture. This study proposes a two-phase evolutionary framework to design a suitable CNN model for medical image classification named TPEvo-CNN. The proposed framework mainly focuses on architectural depth search and hyper-parameter settings of the layered architecture for the CNN model. In the first phase, differential evolution (DE) is applied to determine the optimal number of layers for a CNN architecture, which enhances faster convergence to achieve CNN model architectures. In the second phase, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to fine-tune the hyper-parameter settings of the generated CNN layer architecture in the first phase. Crossover and mutation operations of GA are devised to explore the hyper-parameter search space. Also, an elitism selection strategy is introduced to select the potential hyper-parameters of the CNN architecture for the next generation. The suggested approach is experimented on six medical image datasets, including pneumonia, skin cancer, and four COVID-19 datasets, which are categorized based on image types and class numbers. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPEvo-CNN model compared to existing hand-crafted, pre-trained, and NAS-based CNN models in terms of classification metrics, confusion matrix, radar plots, and statistical analysis.},

In this paper, an innovative simulation framework for the simulation of tendon-driven robots is presented. It consists of a generic physics simulator capable of utilizing CAD robot models and a set of additional tools for simulation control, data acquisition and system investigation. The framework software architecture has been designed using component-based development principles to facilitate the framework extension and customization.

Employing the Lyapunov function method and the subsequence technique, the sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the  $pth$  moments (ES- $pth$ ) of the system are established. Generally, even if all the Markovian jump subsystems (MJSSs) are not ES- $pth$  in the absence of impulses, impulses can still be used to achieve the ES- $pth$  of the system in a specially designed interval, that is, when the impulses and Markovian jump signals meet the corresponding conditions. On the contrary, when all MJSSs are stable without impulses, as long as the impulses parameters and Markovian jump signals are relatively balanced, the system can still maintain the property of ES- $pth$ . Finally, the effectiveness of results is further verified with three examples.},

  abstract={Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers’ disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers’ disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.

  abstract={Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a widely adopted agile methodology for software development that emphasizes the behavior of an application as a series of test cases, using the keywords, which include “Given,” “When,” and “Then.” It involves writing requirements in a structured and testable format that can be evaluated to ensure compliance with the expected behavior. Although a significant amount of research has been conducted to examine the impact of using BDD on software development process yet rare work is observed to synthesize these studies and identify areas for future exploration. This study presents a review of the state-of-the-art BDD by synthesizing the recent advancements in its uses and applications. It aims to systematically investigate the impact of BDD on software development process as well as on product quality by aiding to bridge the communication gap between the stakeholders. The results reveal that BDD is an effective technique to clarify requirements during the software development process as it helps minimizing the intrinsic ambiguities. This work proposes a taxonomy based on the role and applications of BDD in various contexts. It suggests a framework for applying BDD in software development and defines a workflow for its application in software development. Finally, this work highlights some pertinent future directions for the use of BDD in software development.},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={3},
  pages={1867-1881},
  abstract={To resolve the distortion resulting from the mismatch between the interval partition and the watermark distribution in the reversible watermarking based on difference expansion, an investigation is made to difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning. It is found that the conventional floating number-based methods with uniform interval partitioning are not fully considering different watermark distributions, and the embedding distortion can be optimized. Thus, a reversible watermarking based on difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning is put forward for 2D engineering graphics. Each interval is adaptively partitioned into $2^{s}$2s sub-intervals, and the watermark is embedded via transforming the positions of the vertices to its corresponding sub-intervals. The watermark extraction is accomplished by acquiring the indices of the sub-intervals of the watermarked vertices, and the graphics recovery is achieved by moving the watermarked vertices to the reverse direction. Moreover, a new polar coordinate system is built to be invariant to overall geometric transformation and vertices rearrangement. Experimental results and analysis indicate that it maintains good authentication ability and semi-fragility. Furthermore, its imperceptibility is significantly improved compared with the existing watermarking schemes under the same experimental conditions.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has entered a stage of rapid development and increasing deployment. Meanwhile, these low-power devices typically cannot support complex security mechanisms and, thus, are highly susceptible to malware. This article proposes ADRIoT, an anomaly detection framework for IoT networks, which leverages edge computing to uncover potential threats. An edge is empowered with an anomaly detection module, which consists of a traffic capturer, a traffic preprocessor, and a collection of anomaly detectors dedicated to each type of device. Each detector is constructed by an LSTM autoencoder in an unsupervised manner that requires no labeled attack data and is able to handle emerging zero-day attacks. When a device connects to the edge, the edge will fetch the corresponding detector from the cloud and execute it locally. Another problem is the resource constraint of a single edge device like a home router hinders the deployment of such a detection module. To mitigate this problem, we design a multiedge collaborative mechanism that integrates the resource of multiple edges in a local network to increase the overall load capacity. The evaluation demonstrates that ADRIoT can detect various IoT-based attacks effectively and efficiently, showing that ADRIoT can feasibly help build a more secure IoT environment.},

  volume={29},

  pages={331-341},
  abstract={Glyph-based visualization achieves an impressive graphic design when associated with comprehensive visual metaphors, which help audiences effectively grasp the conveyed information through revealing data semantics. However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.},

  abstract={When fully implemented, sixth generation (6G) wireless systems will constitute intelligent wireless networks that enable not only ubiquitous communication but also high-accuracy localization services. They will be the driving force behind this transformation by introducing a new set of characteristics and service capabilities in which location will coexist with communication while sharing available resources. To that purpose, this survey investigates the envisioned applications and use cases of localization in future 6G wireless systems, while analyzing the impact of the major technology enablers. Afterwards, system models for millimeter wave, terahertz and visible light positioning that take into account both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS channels are presented, while localization key performance indicators are revisited alongside mathematical definitions. Moreover, a detailed review of the state of the art conventional and learning-based localization techniques is conducted. Furthermore, the localization problem is formulated, the wireless system design is considered and the optimization of both is investigated. Finally, insights that arise from the presented analysis are summarized and used to highlight the most important future directions for localization in 6G wireless systems.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is on the verge of a major paradigm shift. In the IoT system of the future, IoFT, the “cloud” will be substituted by the “crowd” where model training is brought to the edge, allowing IoT devices to collaboratively extract knowledge and build smart analytics/models while keeping their personal data stored locally. This paradigm shift was set into motion by the tremendous increase in computational power on IoT devices and the recent advances in decentralized and privacy-preserving model training, coined as federated learning (FL). This article provides a vision for IoFT and a systematic overview of current efforts towards realizing this vision. Specifically, we first introduce the defining characteristics of IoFT and discuss FL data-driven approaches, opportunities, and challenges that allow decentralized inference within three dimensions: (i) a global model that maximizes utility across all IoT devices, (ii) a personalized model that borrows strengths across all devices yet retains its own model, (iii) a meta-learning model that quickly adapts to new devices or learning tasks. We end by describing the vision and challenges of IoFT in reshaping different industries through the lens of domain experts. Those industries include manufacturing, transportation, energy, healthcare, quality & reliability, business, and computing.},

  number={},
  pages={70110-70131},
  abstract={A secured platform is a critical component of digital governance, as it helps to ensure the privacy, security, and reliability of the electronic platforms and systems used to manage and deliver public services. Interoperability and data exchange are essential for digital governance, as they enable different government agencies and departments to share data, information, and resources seamlessly, regardless of the platforms and technologies they use. In this paper, we build a secure platform to enhance the trustworthiness of digital governance interoperability and data exchange using blockchain and deep learning-based frameworks. Initially, an optimal blockchain leveraging approach is designed using the bonobo optimization algorithm to authenticate data generated from smart city environments. Furthermore, we introduce the integration of a lightweight Feistel structure with optimal operations to enhance privacy preservation. This integration provides two levels of security and ensures interoperability and double-secured data exchange in digital governance systems. In addition, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to detect and prevent intrusions such as fraud/corruption in the smart city data. This approach enhances transparency and accountability in accessing the data and shows its predominance over other cutting-edge techniques on two benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework in real-time scenarios has been demonstrated through two case studies. Overall, our proposed framework provides a trustworthy platform for digital governance, interoperability, and data exchange, addressing the challenges of privacy, security, and reliability in managing and delivering public services.},

  year={2005},
  volume={2},
  number={3},
  pages={213-225},
  abstract={An increasing trend toward product development in a collaborative environment has resulted in the use of various software tools to enhance the product design. This requires a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across different application domains. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to enable such semantic interoperability. A standards-based approach is used to develop a Product Semantic Representation Language (PSRL). Formal description logic (DAML+OIL) is used to encode the PSRL. Mathematical logic and corresponding reasoning is used to determine semantic equivalences between an application ontology and the PSRL. The semantic equivalence matrix enables resolution of ambiguities created due to differences in syntaxes and meanings associated with terminologies in different application domains. Successful semantic interoperability will form the basis of seamless communication and thereby enable better integration of product development systems. Note to Practitioners-Semantic interoperability of product information refers to automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data, among information resources throughout the product development. This research is motivated by the problems in enabling such semantic interoperability. First, product information is formalized into an explicit, extensible, and comprehensive product semantics representation language (PSRL). The PSRL is open and based on standard W3C constructs. Next, in order to enable semantic translation, the paper describes a procedure to semi-automatically determine mappings between exactly equivalent concepts across representations of the interacting applications. The paper demonstrates that this approach to translation is feasible, but it has not yet been implemented commercially. Current limitations and the directions for further research are discussed. Future research addresses the determination of semantic similarities (not exact equivalences) between the interacting information resources.},

  abstract={The proliferation of various mobile devices equipped with cameras results in an exponential growth of the amount of images. Recent advances in the deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made CNN feature extraction become an effective way to process these images. However, it is still a challenging task to deploy the CNN model on the mobile sensors, which are typically resource-constrained in terms of the storage space, the computing capacity, and the battery life. Although cloud computing has become a popular solution, data security and response latency are always the key issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework for privacy-preserving CNN feature extraction for mobile sensing based on edge computing. To get the most out of the benefits of CNN with limited physical resources on the mobile sensors, we design a series of secure interaction protocols and utilize two edge servers to collaboratively perform the CNN feature extraction. The proposed scheme allows us to significantly reduce the latency and the overhead of the end devices while preserving privacy. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of our scheme.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Objective: Since its outbreak, the rapid spread of COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the globe has pushed the health care system in many countries to the verge of collapse. Therefore, it is imperative to correctly identify COVID-19 positive patients and isolate them as soon as possible to contain the spread of the disease and reduce the ongoing burden on the healthcare system. The primary COVID-19 screening test, RT-PCR although accurate and reliable, has a long turn-around time. In the recent past, several researchers have demonstrated the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods on chest radiography (such as X-ray and CT) for COVID-19 detection. However, existing CNN based DL methods fail to capture the global context due to their inherent image-specific inductive bias. Methods: Motivated by this, in this work, we propose the use of vision transformers (instead of convolutional networks) for COVID-19 screening using the X-ray and CT images. We employ a multi-stage transfer learning technique to address the issue of data scarcity. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by our transformer networks are explainable. Results: We demonstrate that our method not only quantitatively outperforms the recent benchmarks but also focuses on meaningful regions in the images for detection (as confirmed by Radiologists), aiding not only in accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 but also in localization of the infected area. The code for our implementation can be found here - https://github.com/arnabkmondal/xViTCOS. Conclusion: The proposed method will help in timely identification of COVID-19 and efficient utilization of limited resources.},

  abstract={This paper presents a visual analytics approach to analyzing a full picture of relevant topics discussed in multiple sources, such as news, blogs, or micro-blogs. The full picture consists of a number of common topics covered by multiple sources, as well as distinctive topics from each source. Our approach models each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched using a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop a level-of-detail (LOD) visualization that balances both readability and stability. Accordingly, the resulting visualization enhances the ability of users to understand and analyze the matched graph from multiple perspectives. By incorporating metric learning and feature selection into the graph matching algorithm, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result based on their information needs. We have applied our approach to various types of data, including news articles, tweets, and blog data. Quantitative evaluation and real-world case studies demonstrate the promise of our approach, especially in support of examining a topic-graph-based full picture at different levels of detail.},

  abstract={The combination of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture plays a promising role in distributed manufacturing environments in that the peer service can be used to facilitate the integration and discovery of distributed manufacturing resources and achieve communication and collaboration across distributed virtual enterprises. However, the large size, dynamic nature, and heterogeneous expression of distributed manufacturing resources bring forth a serious challenge in scalability and efficiency. This paper presents a self-organized P2P framework that supports scalable and efficient manufacturing service (MS) discovery for cross-enterprise collaboration by forming and maintaining autonomous enterprise peer groups (PG). Each enterprise exhibits as a peer that provides some sharable MSs that are represented comprehensively and formally with a generalized ontology. Each enterprise PG dynamically clusters a set of enterprise peers offering semantically similar MSs, and elects the most reputed peer through multicriteria trust evaluation as its core (i.e., super peer, SP). Then, a MS request can be first routed to the suitable SP and further to its leaf peer in a systematic way, thus supporting efficient service discovery. A prototype system is implemented on JXTA for real application and validated through an experimental case study.},

  pages={76069-76082},
  abstract={Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.},

  abstract={Smart infrastructure has the potential to revolutionise how infrastructure is delivered, managed and automatically controlled. Data and digital twins offer an opportunity to enable this revolution and secure sustainable future smart infrastructure. In this article, we discuss data as an engineering tool and propose to use data throughout the asset's whole life cycle from identifying the need, planning and designing to construction, operation, integration and maintenance. This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making. An example systems architecture for integration of different digital twins is explained and benefits of this data-driven, systemic perspective are discussed.},

  abstract={Specifying system requirements (SysReqs) is a critical activity in complex systems development. The SysReqs and emerging architecture are constructed through gradual and iterative transition from the problem domain and operational stakeholder requirements to the conceptual solution domain. They later constitute the basis for functional requirements elaborating, concept formation, technology selection, function-to-form allocation, and asset utilization. Only rarely can stakeholder requirements (SHRs) readily translate to SysReqs. Systems engineers must therefore elicit, analyze, and evolve the SysReqs, as these will radically affect the system's performance, robustness, endurance, and appeal. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a framework for effective and consistent systems engineering and architecting. MBSE relies on modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM). OPM is a holistic MBSE paradigm and language for complex systems and processes, standardized as ISO 19450, which relies on the principle of minimal universal ontology. In this paper, we propose a model-based requirement engineering (MBRE) approach to facilitate the transition from SHRs to SysReqs, and from SysReqs to system architecture specification. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework in architecting a robotic baggage loading system for a leading international airport.},

Users will be able to switch seamlessly between the two, shifting content from one to the other when necessary. In this paper, we begin with a discussion of the advantages and characteristics of preliminary design. We continue with a review of the state-of-the-art in interactive, board-sized surfaces.

  abstract={We consider the problem of distributed collaboration among multiple agents in an ad hoc setting. We have analyzed this problem within a multiagent task execution scenario, in which every task requires collaboration among multiple agents to get completed. Tasks are also ad hoc in the sense that they appear dynamically and require different sets of expertise or capabilities from agents for completion. We model collaboration within this framework as a decision-making problem in which agents have to determine what capabilities to learn and from which agents to learn them so that they can form teams that have the capabilities required to perform the current tasks satisfactorily. Our proposed technique refers to principles from human learning theory to enable an agent to strategically select appropriate capabilities to learn from other agents. We also use two openness parameters to model the dynamic nature of tasks and agents in the environment. Experimental results within the Repast agent simulator show that by using the appropriate learning strategy, the overall utility of the agents improves considerably. The performance of the agents and their utilities are also dependent on the repetitiveness of tasks and reencounter with agents within the environment. Our results also show that the agents that are able to learn more capabilities from another expert agent outperform the agents who learn only one capability at a time from many agents, and agents who use an intelligent utility maximizing strategy to choose which capabilities to learn outperform the agents who randomly make the learning decision.},

In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle. We have developed a river visualization and a hybrid visualization that combines a scatterplot, a node-link diagram, and a bar chart to convey the label propagation of graph-based SSL. Based on the understanding of the propagation, a user can select regions of interest to inspect and modify the graph.

  abstract={Cosimulation is an important system-level verification approach aimed at integrating multidomain and multi-physics models during complex system development. Currently, the lack of integrating system development process with cosimulations leads to gaps between them, decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of system development. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chains have been proposed to facilitate the integration of complex system development and automated verification using a model-based approach. However, due to the lack of formal and structured specifications, development information sharing is difficult for supporting MBSE facilitating automated cosimulations. In order to formalize cosimulation in an MBSE tool-chain, a scenario-based ontology is developed in this paper, using formal web ontology language (OWL). Ontology refers to a specification expressing the cosimulation implementations as well as the development information represented in the models supporting the MBSE. It is illustrated by a case study of a cosimulation based on Simulink. Protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) and semantic query-enhanced web rule language queries are proposed for evaluating the ontology's completeness and logic for supporting cosimulations. The result demonstrates that the scenario-based ontology formalizes the information related to automated cosimulation development and configurations while using the proposed MBSE tool-chain.},

  abstract={In high-level-architecture (HLA)-based distributed heterogeneous collaborative engineering environments (CEEs), the construction of federation object model files is time consuming. This paper presents an ontology fusion approach aiming at establishing a common understanding in such collaborative environments. The proposed approach has three steps: ontology mapping, ontology alignment, and ontology merging. Ontology mapping employs a top-down approach to explore all bridge relations between two terms from different ontologies based on bridge axioms and deduction rules. Ontology alignment adopts a bottom-up approach to discover implicit bridge relations between two terms from different domain ontologies based on equivalent inference. Ontology merging generates a new collaboration ontology from discovered equivalent bridge relations. It adopts an axiom-based ontology fusion strategy and takes heavy-weighted ontologies into consideration. It can find all the explicit and derived interontology relations. In a typical CEE, the proposed approach has a great potential to improve the efficiency of preparation for HLA-based collaborative engineering processes, reduce the work load for adaptive adjustment of existing platforms, and enhance the reusability and flexibility of CEEs. A case study has been conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={Clinical data are crucial for any medical case to study and understand a patient's condition and to give the patient the best possible treatment. Pervasive healthcare systems apply information and communication technology to enable the usage of ubiquitous clinical data by authorized medical persons. However, quality of clinical data in these applications is, to a large extent, determined by the technological context of the patient. A technological context is characterized by potential technological disruptions that affect optimal functioning of technological resources. The clinical data based on input from these technological resources can therefore have quality degradations. If these degradations are not noticed, the use of this clinical data can lead to wrong treatment decisions, which potentially puts the patient's safety at risk. This paper presents an ontology that specifies the relation among technological context, quality of clinical data, and patient treatment. The presented ontology provides a formal way to represent the knowledge to specify the effect of technological context variations in the clinical data quality and the impact of the clinical data quality on a patient's treatment. Accordingly, this ontology is the foundation for a quality of data framework that enables the development of telemedicine systems that are capable of adapting the treatment when the quality of the clinical data degrades, and thus guaranteeing patients' safety even when technological context varies.},

  abstract={Deep design outlined in the paper is a new approach, where not only tasks, immediate emotions or habits and behaviours are considered. Deep design aims to identify sources of emotionally rich and strong experiences and feelings in order to augment them subsequently by means of smart technology. The most intrinsical needs of users, their deep needs, should be revealed and reflected in the process. Evaluation of a new technology is described as a successive process, starting with immediate decision, followed by short-term acceptance and finally long-term appropriation driven by the deep needs in a role of high order reinforcers. Deep design builds on various existing human-centric and emotion-driven approaches, but brings them further, or maybe rather deeper, bringing deep psycho-technical and socio-technical factors on the highest levels of importance. The idea of deep design is being introduced in a context of ambient technologies for elderlies, because actually there are certain dissonances in what do elderlies need and what many current intelligent technologies offer. As we show in the paper, our research in sources ranging from gerontology to ambient intelligence revealed four clusters of deep needs of elderlies-social touch, autonomy with anticipated support, feeling of being competent and feeling of helpfulness and self-worth.},

  abstract={Ambient awareness on a sidewalk is critical for safe navigation, especially for the people who are visually impaired. Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the “obstacles” on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency. We empirically evaluate a number of state-of-the-art architectures to choose the best model based on fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Finally, we built fully integrated IPSAD prototype on Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3). Audio feedback scheme were implemented to accommodate user preferences and personalization. We perform quantitative evaluation of the prototype system based on the accuracy of the model on Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk (AS) dataset, on-field system performance, data communication, response time (capturing images, recognition of obstacle and feedback), and failure points. Empirical evaluation showed that the accuracy of the model is 87% on the AS dataset and 78.75% on-field system. The system can operate either standalone mode when there is no Internet or cloud mode. In addition, the system can use human intelligence through crowd source and caregiver(s) to assist the users when automated system fails.},

  abstract={Gamification is maturing as an academic research object, but still suffers from growing pains. Challenges identified in a practical gamification activity are used to anchor a discussion of theoretical challenges currently facing gamification. We argue that some of the pain can be attributed to the exceptionalist and formalist definitions of game, and believe that these interpretations assume a dualistic ontological perspective of the world, resulting in problematic dichotomies. An alternative dialectical perspective from which to reimagine gamification and address some of the challenges is offered. This perspective is concretized through the lens of activity theory. The value of applying activity theory is illustrated by reflecting back on the practical and theoretical challenges identified. Reimagining gamification has the potential to afford participants with greater opportunities for action, and also to drive transformation of existing practices and thus enable agency. It is captured by considering it as an expansive cycle of activity.},

Recommendation mechanisms anchored in solid theoretical achievements are currently a huge challenge in the scientific research. This paper presents a proposal for teaching-learning techniques recommendation supported by an ontological modeling approach. The recommendation aims to assist educators in designing of teaching-learning activities. The recommendation process is part of the ACEM model which integrates an authoring design tool.

Thus, practical issues within the AAS concept and respective solutions are hard to identify. In this paper, presents our experience with the implementation of an AAS use case. The AAS is used as information source to create an ontology, which is then used for security analysis. The paper discusses the use-case-specific modelling language selection and provides a practical examination of several of our implementations that use OWL and OPC UA together.

  abstract={Many chronic conditions can be better managed by patients themselves with the use of decision support tools. This becomes even more necessary in the case of multimorbidity (i.e. presence of multiple chronic diseases) or in conditions where several underlying risk factors need to be managed and monitored in order to avoid relapse or the reoccurrence of an event, like in the case of stroke. However, despite the fact that these decision support systems are becoming prevalent, little is known about the best practices in designing for end-users - patients and their carers. The aim of the present paper is to report on the process of involving users to inform the design of a novel data-driven self-management mobile decision support tool for stroke survivors, called CONSULT. User involvement was facilitated through the use of a two-phase participatory design approach. During both phases a total of 44 stakeholders participated, including stroke survivors, carers, healthcare professionals and researchers. The paper documents the findings of the participatory design process, in the form of design recommendations, and describes their implications for user interface design.},

  abstract={The level of similarity of knowledge work across occupations and industries allows for the design of supportive information and communication technology (ICT) that can be widely used. In a previous ethnographically informed study, we identified activities that can be supported to increase knowledge maturing, conceptualized as goal-oriented learning on a collective level. The aim of this paper is to investigate the current state of support and success of these knowledge maturing activities and to contrast them with their perceived importance, to identify those which have the highest potential for being supported by ICT. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through telephone interviews with representatives from 126 organizations throughout Europe in a sample stratified according to size, sector, and knowledge-intensity. The activities that appear to be most promising are “reflecting on and refining work practices and processes,” “finding people with particular knowledge or expertise,” as well as “assessing, verifying, and rating information.” Rich empirical material about how these activities are performed and also the issues that emerged and need to be managed were collected. Three clusters of organizations were identified: best performing organizations, people- and awareness-oriented organizations, and hesitant formalists. It was found that a balanced knowledge strategy that leaned toward personalization outperformed a codification strategy.},

  abstract={3D content of immersive virtual and augmented reality applications typically consists of objects that can interact with users and other objects. Interactions may be followed by changes of objects' properties, including their geometry, structure and appearance as well as high-level, domain-specific semantics. Logging interactions and temporal 3D content properties in a uniform, explorable way can be useful in various domains that involve multiple collaborating users and interacting objects, and can benefit from analysis of the users' and objects' behavior, e.g., in design, training, education, e-commerce, marketing and merchandising. However, the available approaches do not enable creation of explorable immersive VR/AR applications with regards to interactions and temporal 3D content properties. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to generating explorable interaction logs in immersive applications. The logs are ontologies compliant with the semantic web. Hence, the approach may be used with general or domain knowledge in a way intelligible to average users or domain specialists without expertise in IT. The approach is discussed in the context of a heterogeneous immersive environment, which combines diverse VR presentation and interaction devices to enable collaboration of multiple users within urban design.},

  abstract={As one of the most promising energy-efficient emerging paradigms for designing digital systems, approximate computing has attracted a significant attention in recent years. Applications utilizing approximate computing (AxC) can tolerate some loss of quality in the computed results for attaining high performance. Approximate arithmetic circuits have been extensively studied; however, their application at system level has not been extensively pursued. Furthermore, when approximate arithmetic circuits are applied at system level, error-accumulation effects and a convergence problem may occur in computation. Multiple approximate components can interact in a typical datapath, hence benefiting from each other. Many applications require more complex datapaths than a single multiplication. In this paper, a hardware/software co-design methodology for adaptive approximate computing is proposed. It makes use of feature constraints to guide the approximate computation at various accuracy levels in each iteration of the learning process in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The proposed adaptive methodology also considers the input operand distribution and the hybrid approximation. Compared with a baseline design, the proposed method significantly reduces the power-delay product while incurring in only a small loss of accuracy. Simulation and a case study of image segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  pages={309-315},
  abstract={In semantics-based component retrieval ontology is usually employed as the semantic basis for component representation and matching. Existing methods always assume that the ontology already exists. However, ontology construction itself is a big challenge and the construction of ontology for component retrieval has its own characteristics differing from general domain ontology, including the emphasis on functional semantics, the explicit instance set (i.e. semantic descriptions of all the components stored in the repository) and the explicit objective of characterizing components for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an incremental and FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) based ontology construction method. The feature of incremental ontology construction means a collaborative and interactive process with component providers to collect basic input/output descriptions of components. FCA with the extension of hierarchical-valued concept context is adopted to elicit concepts from original component descriptions to construct ontological hierarchy for functional concepts. After concept analysis, semantic representation of each component can also be filled automatically. So our method can alleviate the efforts of ontology construction remarkably and the quality can also be ensured in terms of the requirements of component retrieval.},

  pages={124-131},
  abstract={In various time-slots, the real-time reasoning tasks generated by autonomous vehicles are scheduled within tolerance time, which is the key problem to be solved in autonomous driving. Tasks are traditionally scheduled on the on-board unit (OBU), which leads to long completion time of tasks. Heuristic algorithms are widely used in task scheduling problems, which usually causes to premature convergence. Scheduling tasks in edge environment can effectively reduce completion time of tasks. In this paper, a workflow scheduling strategy was designed in edge environment according to the difference of reasoning tasks and the changes of edge nodes in various time-slots. Firstly, the model of Markov decision process (MDP) was built to describe the problem scenario, and the completion time of reasoning tasks was calculated by the workflow scheduling algorithm. Secondly, the Q-learning algorithm based on simulated anealing (SA-QL) was proposed to optimize the completion time of reasoning tasks. Finally, the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms based on simulated annealing (SA-RL) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were comprehensively displayed from four perspectives: effectiveness, feasibility, exploration and convergence. The experimental results show that both SA-RL algorithms and PSO algorithm have good performance in feasibility and effectiveness. TD(0) algorithms have better performance of exploration and TD() algorithms have that of convergence.},

  abstract={Distributed software system design is by nature an ill-defined or wicked problem. In order to learn to design them, the student must be presented with complex, open-ended problems for which there may be more than one correct solution. The decision-making strategies students acquired in previous courses are not effective when applied to large, complex problems of distributed systems. Students (novice designers) tend to think linearly and focus only on the problem at hand. They also tend to use trial-and-error strategies and they lack confidence in their design decisions. The purpose of the distributed systems' course is to create a learning approach that helps students to adopt and to apply expert design decision-making strategies. We use a case-based learning approach with classroom assessment techniques and rubrics to identify the critical weaknesses in the approaches that novices typically use when attempting to solve difficult design-oriented problems. The novice-oriented knowledge-based learning and application environment is supported by scaffoldings to incorporate expert strategies. In this paper, we describe the experience and the learning environment that provides the opportunities for professional development. We present and analyze our data comparing the students' outcomes over four terms, the time it takes to develop our students' expertise and how time spent with an expert (instructor) is crucial to an overall development.},

  abstract={The base learners and labeled samples (shots) in an ensemble few-shot classifier greatly affect the model performance. When the performance is not satisfactory, it is usually difficult to understand the underlying causes and make improvements. To tackle this issue, we propose a visual analysis method, FSLDiagnotor. Given a set of base learners and a collection of samples with a few shots, we consider two problems: 1) finding a subset of base learners that well predict the sample collections; and 2) replacing the low-quality shots with more representative ones to adequately represent the sample collections. We formulate both problems as sparse subset selection and develop two selection algorithms to recommend appropriate learners and shots, respectively. A matrix visualization and a scatterplot are combined to explain the recommended learners and shots in context and facilitate users in adjusting them. Based on the adjustment, the algorithm updates the recommendation results for another round of improvement. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate that FSLDiagnotor helps build a few-shot classifier efficiently and increases the accuracy by 12% and 21%, respectively.},

  abstract={By studying the NCS(networked control system) data transmission of multiple control loops, an algorithm based on multi-parameter fuzzy neural network (MP-FNN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the fuzzy rules given by expert experience, through the ability of self-learning, trained the fuzzy neural network and memorized the fuzzy control rules, and obtained the network demand of each control loop. Then, using the idea of real-time task scheduling, according to the idle time and the criticality of each control task, the urgency parameters of the loop control task are obtained from the defined fuzzy control rules. Finally, combining the urgency parameter and the network demand parameter of the control task, the dynamic weight algorithm is used to obtain the priority of each loop and adjust it online before the next sampling moment. This article uses Matlab's truetime toolbox for the establishment and simulation of NCS models, and anfis toolbox for fuzzy neural network training. Compared with several classic scheduling algorithms, it shows that the algorithm has a better improvement on the loop dynamic control performance.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Melanomas are the most dangerous form of skin cancer, accounting for a majority of mortality among all skin cancers. As melanomas tend to go unnoticed without constant supervision, it is important that steps are taken to identify and prevent their spread before they reach more severe stages. Many recent clinical trials and research have identified various indicators of melanoma that may be used for early detection. In this work, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to localize and detect one such indicator - a strong correlation between the number of pigmented freckles in a person's iris and their risk of developing melanoma on the skin. We model this task of detecting pigmented iris freckles as a single-class, one-sized object detection problem. For this, we propose Slim-YOLO, a lighter and simpler object detection model based on YOLOv3. The simplifications of Slim-YOLO are introduced through reducing the model computations by removing the need for multiple detection scales and classification. We also remove the constraints applied by anchor boxes. The experimental results show that Slim-YOLO is capable of achieving comparable performance (90.7% in mAP) with YOLOv3 (93.7%) while yielding a smaller model size of two-third the size of YOLOv3. These may prove highly beneficial to better facilitate deployment of the model on mobile devices in the future. Thus, we automate the iris freckle detection process successfully to help provide insights to practitioners, and contribute to the use of deep learning methods in detection of anomalies in medical imaging.},

  abstract={This article reports on a survey of network and Wi-Fi enabled technologies to support disabled learners in museums and similar cultural heritage environments. In this study, literature is classified using the Epistemological Model of Disability, classifying and defining methodologies and ontologies as it does so. Data was collected using a systematic literature review using six academic databases, which included peer-reviewed articles from a range of sources. The analysis addressed two research questions, and was developed in three phases: the first phase examined trends, definitions and methods of teaching and learning in cultural heritage; the second categorized genres that emerged in the first phase and discussed meta-levels; the third developed a critical discussion on teaching and learning models. The study had two principal findings: 1) museums have done much to make themselves part of the inclusion agenda, 2) more needs to be done to improve management strategies, increase agency and reduce practice using deficit models.},

  abstract={Radiography is one of the most widely used imaging techniques in the world. Since its inception, it has continued to evolve, leading to the development of intelligent and automated radiography systems that are able to perceive parts of their environment and respond accordingly. However, such systems do not provide a complete view of the examination space and are therefore unable to detect multiple objects and fully ensure the safety of patients, staff and equipment during the execution of the movement. In this paper, we present a system architecture based on ROS (Robot Operating System) to solve these challenges and integrate an autonomous X-ray device. The architecture retrieves point clouds from range sensors placed at specific locations in the examination room. By integrating different subsystems, the architecture merges the data from the different sensors to map the space. It also implements downsampling and clustering methods to identify objects and later distinguish obstacles. A subsystem generates bounding boxes based on the detected obstacles and feeds them to a motion planning framework (MoveIt!) to enable collision avoidance during motion execution. At the same time, a subsystem implements a deep neural network model (PointNet) to classify the detected obstacles. Finally, the developed system architecture provided promising results after being deployed in a Gazebo simulated examination space and on a use case test platform.},

  abstract={The creation of quality software depends on the existence of a quality software design. In particular, it is important to identify inconsistencies that might be injected at the design level. We have developed a common ontology that integrates software specification knowledge and software design knowledge in order to facilitate the interoperability of formal requirements modeling tools and software design tools with the end goal of detecting errors in software designs. Our approach focuses initially on the integration of unified modeling language (UML) with the formal requirements modeling language, knowledge acquisition in automated specification (KAOS), in order to help automate the detection of inconsistencies in UML designs thereby enhancing the quality of the original design and ultimately integrating the multiple views inherent in UML. We demonstrate the integration of UML and KAOS with an elevator system case study},

  abstract={Supporting different stakeholder viewpoints across the product's entire lifecycle requires semantic richness for representing product related information. This paper proposes a multi-layered product-modeling framework that enables stakeholders to define their product-specific models and relate product-specific models to physical or simulated instances. The framework is defined within the Model-driven Architecture and adapted to the multi-layer approach of the architecture. The data layer represents real world products, the model layer includes models of those products, and the meta-model layer defines the product modeling language. The semantic-based product modeling language described in this paper is specialized from a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the semantics of their product models explicitly and logically in an engineering-friendly way. The interactions between these three layers are described to illustrate how each layer in the framework is used in a product engineering context.},

  volume={35},

  pages={4376-4394},
  abstract={In the past two decades, the use of ontologies has grown accompanied by a diversity in ontological representations and applications to more comprehensive domains. Knowledge engineers have found it expeditious to break down large (monolithic) ontologies to work with smaller fragments. Ontology modularization is the process of extracting a fragment, or ”module”, from an ontology, based on predefined requirements. Due to both the diversity in ontological representations and motivations for modularizing, the body of research on ontology modularization techniques has become extremely large and may be intimidating to the novice ontology researcher. The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive, albeit high-level, review of ontology modularization techniques. A systematic literature review covering January 1st 2000 to July 31st 2020 was performed to find and classify papers on ontology modularization techniques. The techniques exhibiting certain properties with respect to several features were assessed, and the modularization techniques were classified with a multi-dimensional perspective. The classifications are intended to guide one to a suitable modularization process in accordance with the requirements. The limitations of ontology modularization techniques are highlighted in the conclusion, and characteristics of a desirable framework for an ontology representation that would be best-suited for modularization are presented.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for Model-based Ontology Coverage Analysis (MOCA) and applies it to SysML models of mission architectures. An ontology is a set of concepts that constitute a common language, standard terminology, and consistent pattern reference across multiple models within an organization, industry, or domain. The purpose of MOCA is to assess the overlap between a system architecture model and a given ontology, and thereby the architecture model's compliance with the ontology and the ontology's utilization by the architecture. We demonstrate MOCA on a SysML model of a humanitarian airlift mission, using a conceptual mission architecting SysML profile model that serves as the ontology. MOCA automates and simplifies reasoning over models, and creates digital model-based artifacts that support stakeholders in concept validation, decision making, and system/mission design. Thus, MOCA enhances digital systems engineering.},

  abstract={The analysis of variance in complex text traditions is an arduous task when carried out manually. Text alignment algorithms provide domain experts with a robust alternative to such repetitive tasks. Existing white-box approaches allow the digital humanities to establish syntax-based metrics taking into account the spelling, morphology and order of words. However, they produce limited results, as semantic meanings are typically not taken into account. Our interdisciplinary collaboration between visualization and digital humanities combined a semi-supervised text alignment approach based on word embeddings that take not only syntactic but also semantic text features into account, thereby improving the overall quality of the alignment. In our collaboration, we developed different visual interfaces that communicate the word distribution in high-dimensional vector space generated by the underlying neural network for increased transparency, assessment of the tool’s reliability and overall improved hypothesis generation. We further offer visual means to enable the expert reader to feed domain knowledge into the system at multiple levels with the aim of improving both the product and the process of text alignment. This ultimately illustrates how visualization can engage with and augment complex modes of reading in the humanities.},

  abstract={One of the main challenges in providing intelligent support to learners is the establishment of the learner's context. Most of the work done in this area is based on modelling an individual learner's context without considering the learner's interaction with other people. We consider a mobile collaborative learner's context where the learner is mobile and interacts with others in continuing her learning process. In this paper, we analyse the context of a mobile collaborative learner in an ambient intelligent environment by using a simple scenario. We examine the literature on context models in the area of context aware computer systems to see if the context model for a mobile collaborative learner in an intelligent environment can be supported by the currently available models. This paper discusses the context of a mobile collaborative learner in an ambient intelligent environment. This work uses an existing knowledge-based context model to evaluate if this model is applicable to mobile collaborative learners. We believe that the analysis presented in this paper highlights some of the issues in modelling the context for mobile collaborative learners. We also hope to identify weaknesses and strengths in existing context models and hope to provide some directions for better support for modelling the context of mobile collaborative learners},

  abstract={Systems developed without addressing subjective experience can generate interactions successful in their tasks but counterproductive as experiences. Addressing subjective experience requires creating hypothetical situations with realistic human actors, subjectivity's embodied nature prevents examination in isolation from either person or context. The Contextual Scenario Framework (CSF) assists in the systematic creation of scenarios incorporating subjective experience. It supports structuring, management and reuse of discoveries from domain research, enabling authors to weave contextual information throughout scenario development. This paper extends the CSF in three ways: relating it to structural features of subjective consciousness, formalizing the model for implementation, and increasing linkages between scenarios and field data. A demonstration case starts with a generic event sequence from a Use Case. The scenario written using the CSF intermingles the source sequence with field-research learnings to explore the subjective experiences of two human actors, addressing the question, "What might happen in the real world?".},

  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Current concerns regarding an efficient water resource management have highlighted the necessity of top-down and bottom-up interjurisdictional alliances that aim to collectively improve the status of the watershed and the search for sustainable solutions. Acute problems are triggered by direct (land use change) or indirect (climate change, legislation) human interventions in the natural systems within which we live. Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. Effective watershed management requires information-rich communication among central and local authorities, private industry, citizens, and academia. Effective watershed planning, regulation and management also require timely conveyance of information to agency staff, decision makers, and the public. Customized Decision Support Systems (DSS) are required for this purpose, to provide wide access to workflows to query, visualization, and compare vital information. DSS can use basically the same information for strategic or emergency planning if the access to the data, simulations, and workflow operation can be done in real-time. It is the duty of public and private sectors to determine how to effectively support the decision-making process without neglecting the appropriate amount of evaluation and the inclusion of stakeholders in the process. The paper presents a concept for interjurisdictional collaboration in water resources management, using a DSS platform that integrates the data and information needed to support short- and long-term watershed actions. The focus of the paper is on describing an ontological framework which combines representative actors/stakeholders, hydrologic concepts and relationships with elements of offering an integrated approach to complex water related processes.},

  abstract={Exergames combine physical exercises and games. Thorough knowledge about the physical exercises is crucial in designing efficient exergames. Expert involvement in the design process, in this case with physiotherapists, is an efficient way to gather and retain domain specific knowledge for the design team. However, experts rarely have experience exploring design alternatives in a playful way, which is important when participating on the co-design of serious games like exergames. We explored the question: How can we involve experts to share and professionally explore their domain specific knowledge in a play-centric game design process? We present two co-design exergame workshops with physiotherapists. Based on lessons learned from the first workshop, we explored in the second workshop framing the entire workshop process as a game. We found that gamifying the workshop process into a design game provided a way to change the experts' effective-oriented mindset into a playful mindset. This article demonstrates some lessons learned from this process of creating and using such a method and proposes some directions for future research and applications.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) mobile communication technology, companies continue to file for new patents or obtain licenses from patent assignees to secure the right to use LTE-A related intellectual properties (IPs) for product commercialization. There are many standard essential patents (SEPs) complying with LTE-A specifications set by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). LTE-A patent pools are collaborative efforts to gather SEPs from IP owners to reduce the process time of SEP licensing for manufacturers. This research develops the computer supported analysis process for the comparative study of two major LTE-A patent pools (i.e., Sisvel and Via Licensing). The first step is to search the ETSI database for LTE-A SEPs. The second step analyzes the patents in both pools based on IPC classification and LTE-A ontology definition. The main goal of the research is to reveal the patent profiles of LTE-A patent pools for collaborative and collective SEP licensing, which enables LTE-A technology developers and adopters (such as mobile device manufacturers) to fully cooperate in new product development and commercialization efficiently and economically.},

Therefore, one challenge in human-machine integration is how to establish an appropriate knowledge management (KM) model to support integration and sharing of heterogeneous product knowledge. Aiming at the diversity of design knowledge, this paper proposes an ontology-based model to reach at an unambiguous and normative representation of the knowledge. Firstly, an ontology-based human-machine integrated design framework is described, then corresponding ontologies and sub-ontologies are established according to different purposes and scopes. Secondly, a similarity calculation-based ontology integration method composed of ontology mapping and ontology merging is introduced. The ontology searching-based knowledge sharing method is then developed. Finally, a case of human-machine integrated design of a large ultra-precision grinding machine is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract={Riva is a Business Process Architecture (BPA) modelling approach that has been used to model key business processes for specific organizational boundaries based on the brainstorming of Essential Business Entities (EBEs). During its early stages, Riva relies heavily on brainstorming the EBEs from stakeholders. However, it does not provide a systematic process for deriving generalized BPA models from multiple heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, when deriving processes from the identified Riva-EBEs, Riva identifies Case Processes (CPs), Case Management Processes (CMPs), and Case Strategy Processes (CSPs). However, the Riva literature mainly supports modelling the CPs, CMPs, and the relationships between them. It does not focus on modelling the CSPs nor their related relationships. Accordingly, Riva has been semantically-enriched by the srBPA ontology component. But this semantic enrichment was limited to the original aspects of Riva and does not address the raised issues. This paper presents an adaptation to the semantic enrichment of Riva (an adapted srBPA ontology) to include the semantic representation of the CSPs and their related relationships, in addition to supporting the representation of BPA concepts and resolving semantic heterogeneity resulting from electing the EBEs from multiple heterogeneous sources. The proposed adapted ontology has been evaluated by checking its consistency, completeness, and redundancy.},

  abstract={Current approaches to the design of interactive systems emphasize openness, dynamic behavior, and evolution of the system. There is also a growing interest in accounting for human values and norms. This paper takes a universal perspective informed by discourse ethics and it argues that value and norm issues cannot be fully resolved in the design process and that they require the continuous participation of users in use time. On the other hand, the increasing complexity in global contexts necessitates exploiting machine intelligence to adapt the system behavior to the interaction context. This paper comments on two complementary reflective principles for interactive systems (i.e., the meta-adaptation and meta-communication principles) and argues that both principles need to be implemented as system's features to support computer's as well as users' reflections.},

  volume={},

  pages={1532-1537},
  abstract={The essence of knowledge representation learning is to embed the knowledge graph into a low-dimensional vector space to make knowledge computable and deductible. Semantic indiscriminate knowledge representation models usually focus more on the scalability on real world knowledge graphs. They assume that the vector representations of entities and relations are consistent in any semantic environment. Semantic discriminate knowledge representation models focus more on precision. They assume that the vector representations should depend on the specific semantic environment. However, both the two kinds only consider knowledge embedding in semantic space, ignoring the rich features of network structure contained between triplet entities. The MulSS model proposed in this paper is a joint embedding learning method across network structure space and semantic space. By synchronizing the Deepwalk network representation learning method into the semantic indiscriminate model TransE, MulSS achieves better performance than TransE and some semantic discriminate knowledge representation models on triplet classification task. This shows that it is of great significance to extend knowledge representation learning from the single semantic space to the network structure and semantic joint space.},

  abstract={In the area of human biodata governance, one of the most pressing questions is how to address the trade-off between promoting innovation and safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms that arise from the development, deployment, and use of AI and data processing. This paper considers that this trade-off poses a dilemma and raises the question of how to achieve governance that promotes biotechnological innovation and research while protecting the fundamental rights and values of individuals and groups. The aim of this paper is to explore regulatory instruments in the EU data protection law that can strike a balance between innovation and protection in the governance of human biodata. To this end, it focuses on meta-regulation as a regulatory technique and examines data protection impact assessment (DPIA) as a method for addressing the tension between innovation and protection. Based on doctrinal legal analysis, it argues that while DPIA is a useful instrument to seek a solution in this dilemma, further reflection and clarification are needed to improve the methods of conducting the impact assessment.},

In our work we use the schemas and data instances of the information repositories to discover semantic correspondences between the schema elements and build a domain ontological view. We apply the hierarchical clustering technique on the data instances and use the clusters in the further analysis to reduce the cost of processing a large amount of data. The matching of schema elements is based on the probability distribution of the data instances. The preliminary results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract={The adoption of AI in the health sector has its share of benefits and harms to various stakeholder groups and entities. There are critical risks involved in using AI systems in the health domain; risks that can have severe, irreversible, and life-changing impacts on people’s lives. With the development of innovative AI-based applications in the medical and healthcare sectors, new types of risks emerge. To benefit from novel AI applications in this domain, the risks need to be managed in order to protect the fundamental interests and rights of those affected. This will increase the level to which these systems become ethically acceptable, legally permissible, and socially sustainable. In this paper, we first discuss the necessity of AI risk management in the health domain from the ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. We then present a taxonomy of risks associated with the use of AI systems in the health domain called HART, accessible online at https://w3id.org/hart. HART mirrors the risks of a variety of different real-world incidents caused by use of AI in the health sector. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the taxonomy for different stakeholder groups and further research.},

  abstract={Knowledge sharing is an essential factor to build virtual collaboration across organizations. Therefore, from the product design point of view, identifying required product knowledge is a very important thing. This product knowledge is closely related with product requirements and functions. However the type of knowledge and information of product, needed in virtual collaboration, is still not comprehensively explored and understood. The main purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify generic product knowledge and information to support knowledge sharing in a virtual collaboration environment. In this paper we propose a methodology for identification and modeling of product information, based on the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) principle. The FBS principle was then translated into classification of product information. The classification can give a comprehensive view of a product. The flexibility of classification developed in this research makes it easier to be implemented across various different type of product. It also provides a better understanding about the products and its subcomponents. The identification of product information was followed by translation of it into a model. A model of generic product information was successfully built. Further research is planned towards developing a combined graphical and ontological product information model based on FBS principles.},

  pages={1033-1044},
  abstract={Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning (DL) approaches have resulted in the dynamic generation of trace links that are far more accurate than was previously possible. However, DL-generated links lack clear explanations, and therefore non-experts in the domain can find it difficult to understand the underlying semantics of the link, making it hard for them to evaluate the link's correctness or suitability for a specific software engineering task. In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the correctness of the link.},

  abstract={This paper reviews current publications and the concept of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in future wireless networks. The unpredictable fading of wireless channels has become one of the most significant performance bottlenecks. The IRS consists of many metasurface devices that may be individually adjudicated to add phase changes to signal reflections. It may actively alter the signal propagation parameters in favor of signal reception and achieve the idea of a smart radio environment. In this survey, we first introduce essential concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its configurability. Then, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS’s phase control and the transceivers’ transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., capacity maximization and energy minimization problems; beamforming discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks, and using the deep learning method for discussion in IRS. Finally, we highlight some interesting practical challenges, such as security transmission, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and mm-Wave communication.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={84-91},
  abstract={SaaS CRM tools typically contain a rich repository of conversations between sales agents and prospective customers until the sales deal is won or lost. These conversations can occur over different channels such as email, chat, and voice calls. In such settings, conversation context and product purchase intent are spread across tens of message exchanges. To accurately predict the probability of a deal win, it is important to build classification models that capture such context continuity across a long chain of message exchanges. While past BERT-based work on modeling multi-turn conversations captures context history, they fall short when applied directly to sales negotiations which are not strictly multi-turn in nature, contain long messages, and are often interspersed with irrelevant “noise”. Additionally, extracting and communicating pivotal phrases in a customer message is a crucial undertaking as a part of model explainability. This requires additional attention to augmentation mechanisms keeping in mind the same context continuity. In this paper, we present a BERT-based novel architecture to achieve the above goals of conversation classification and prediction explainability. We train this architecture on a corpus of email exchanges available internally. Our architecture relies on a BERT-based multi-task training regimen trained for two tasks-one learns to predict deal closure from an email chain, and the other learns to extract multiple key-phrases from individual emails. The BERT setup also learns from short-term context to build email representations, which are further enhanced with extracted key-phrases using an attention-over-attention mechanism. Finally, Bi-LSTM layers capture long-term context across all phrase-enhanced emails in the conversation to predict deal closure. Experimental results demonstrate a~14-15% improvement in deal conversion accuracy and~10-12% improvement in Jaccard score for extracted phrases, outperforming our baseline model.},

  abstract={As well as in traditional software engineering, reuse is a key factor for the efficient and efficacious construction and evolution of complex Web applications. Efficaciously integrated in the development process and supported by an appropriate framework, reuse significantly increases development speed, application quality and, by enabling rapid prototyping, improves stakeholder communications. Although reuse aspects in traditional software engineering have been thoroughly investigated, their successful adoption to the Web Engineering domain still remains nontrivial leaving room for dedicated Web-specific solutions. Beyond that, current consolidation activities in the Web Engineering community underline the significance of a unifying solution. To this end, we present a comprehensive ontology-based Web Engineering reuse approach that establishes a common basis for cross-methodology reuse strategies and emphasizes stakeholder collaboration. To unfold the full potential of reuse, it incorporates both planned and spontaneous reuse strategies. We point out the approach’s extensibility and applicability for cross-methodological Web Engineering and demonstrate how it considerably accelerates development speed and improves stakeholder communications.},

  pages={38296-38317},
  abstract={Background: Robust and useful tools for exploratory analysis in biosciences are still lagging behind the size and complexity of the biological datasets produced since the completion of the human genome in 2000. A possible reason is that developers are unlikely to understand domain and case-specific requirements of existing research questions. Methods: We formed a design team comprising a visualization expert, a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, bioinformatics domain experts, and the Principal Investigator (PI) as a `facilitator' filling the communication gap between them. We implemented co-design methodology. Results: We identified the need for an interactive visual analytic tool for exploratory analysis of biological data. We describe the process of developing MAHiCGO, a novel tool for the simultaneous visualization of MA Gene Expression data, Hi-C data and Gene Ontology (GO) information in an interactive manner for the exploratory analysis of biological data. Conclusion: The key finding of this research to include a facilitator role in the co-design is useful in the evolving fields of design research and of bioinformatics, merging computational sciences with biosciences. The findings support in understanding new functional roles in the field of design, in particular design of computer applications in highly complex domains such as bioinformatics, and for highly complex tasks such as exploratory tasks. The findings also stress on the key role of visualization to expand user cognitive capabilities, and of co-design for constant engagement of domain experts in the creation process.},

Based on the new requirements of collaborative design process, a strategy of CPD based on the modularity thought and multi-agent technology is proposed. Firstly, the model of agent for CPD is constructed. And on the basis of the traditional methods of modularity, an agent-based modular decomposition method is presented. Secondly, the best matching agent is selected to solve the module by counting the integrated similarity degree between the task set of modules and the agent experiences set. And making use of the black-board mechanism the collaborative environment is achieved to support the multi-agent collaborative work. Finally, an agent-based automobile collaborative R&D platform is developed. The rationality and effectiveness of this methodology is proved in an instance of collaborative design of automobile body.},

People use these systems to collect steps taken, calories ingested, etc. These ecosystems also support the collection of physiological data. For example, users collect heart rate data during exercise, and even electro dermal activity data to help detect the onset of seizures. Analyzing physiological data, however, and relating it to specific behaviors or events, is challenging. In this paper, we present an 11-week, multi-session, participatory design case study, identify challenges in analyzing physiological and behavior data, and present BEDA, an analytics tool we developed to mitigate the challenges. The two primary data analysis challenges include: (1) interfacing multiple software programs required for capturing and analyzing the different data sources, and (2) extending the limited data analysis functionality within and across these software programs to support a wide range of physiological data analyses. BEDA resolves the fragmented analysis pipeline by integrating closely-related analysis tasks into a common interface. It also addresses the extensibility problem by integrating scripts that apply any custom or publicly-available function written in MATLAB or R. These scripts extend basic analytic capability, provide the analytic bridge between physiological and behavior data, and incorporate machine learning algorithms to highlight behaviors associated with physiological data. BEDA's capabilities mitigated the challenges of signal analysis and fragmented data sources, and motivated behavioral scientists to combine physiological measures with behavioral analysis. Although we developed this tool for a domain-specific case study, the use of the tool can be generalized to analyze any time-based data source or sources.},

  abstract={In this work-in-progress, we present the design and implementation of a novel higher education medical computing continuous program that addresses on-demand, relevant clinical and health-care industry needs. A consortium of computing science and engineering academics and researchers, entrepreneurship and industry representatives, and clinicians is jointly designing an ecosystem that channels relevant needs from medical, clinical, and industrial environments into requirements for medical computing academic training. The design of this interdisciplinary program adheres to participatory design principles. Here, we outline the motivation and demands of such program, the design of the program, the principles and practices planned and implemented, and we report on first implementation steps. Since the graduate programs of computing and engineering mostly provide broader education, the graduates from these programs lack relevant clinical perspectives, necessary to work in- and advance the domain of medical computing. Likewise, the graduates from clinical and medical programs are often missing up-to-date computing skills, essential to comprehend and manage the fast-developing industry of medical computing technology. By implementing the processes of funnelling industrial and clinical aspects, we ensure that the graduates are equipped with relevant knowledge, and become a part of germane networks. We also report on challenges, experience, and lessons learned.},

Despite its manifold benefits, the interest and willingness of Malaysian researchers to share their research data are noticeably low. Likewise, Malaysia has not performed well in recent international open data assessments. Hence, The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) addressed the Malaysia Open Science Platform (MOSP) as one of the key strategies in National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy 2021-2030. This study aimed to determine the organizational enablers that facilitate the delivery of MOSP strategic management by employing three qualitative approaches: literature review, desk research and semi-structured interview. This study determined leadership, people and cooperation as soft enablers while technology and systems as hard enablers. The change and stakeholder management were proposed as success factors in delivering these variables. A strategic framework was also presented as a foundation for MOSTI in formulating a robust and comprehensive strategy.},

  abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) is a core corporate activity responsible for moving commodities and services from one point to another through a variety of stakeholders. The traditional SCM is based on a centralized approach managed at the central headquarter, and all other sub-offices get instructions from the main office. Some major issues with present SCM systems are security, transactional transparency, traceability, stakeholder involvement, product counterfeiting, additional delays, fraud, and instabilities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data and build trust efficiently and transparently. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments without a third party. To address the present SCM issues, BC technology is a feasible solution. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, in this paper, we present a survey on the adoption of BC in SCM. This paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the literature on BC characteristics, implementations, and business consequences in various SCM. This Blockchain-centered study, in particular, discloses the research state and delineates future research directions by studying and analyzing 97 up-to-date publications highlighting BC’s supply chain uses. Transparency and traceability, information sharing, product anti-counterfeiting, and building trust are the major aspects propelling BC’s implementation in SCM. Further, we analyzed various applications of SCM in which BC can be used as a probable technology to secure all transactions. Then, we have highlighted open issues and research challenges for adopting BC technology in SCM that open the doors for beginners eager to start work in this amazing area.},

  abstract={Requirements engineering (RE) has established itself as a core software engineering discipline. It is well acknowledged that good RE leads to higher quality software and considerably reduces the risk of failure or exceeding budgets of software development projects. Therefore, it is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. However, to date there exists no central concept of what the most useful educational approaches are in RE education in order to best interweave theory with practice. To lay the foundation for this important mission, we conducted a systematic literature review. In this paper, we report on the results and provide a synthesis of instructional approaches in RE education. Findings show that experiential learning through projects, collaboration, and realistic stakeholder involvement are among the most promising trends to teach both RE theory and develop student soft skills.},

  abstract={To assist and protect citizen communities and police officers, robots have been developed for situational responses (e.g., explosive ordinance disposal). However, the robots used by law enforcement are typically expensive, can be difficult to operate, and do not readily facilitate communication between individuals. Recent research by the authors examined how communication impacts trust between robots and humans in the context of law enforcement. Using a mobile communication robot, law enforcement officers (LEOs) reported high levels of trust because the robot provided near face-to-face interaction using screens, microphones, and speakers. This paper seeks to expand upon the previous findings by discussing public perception, privacy, safety, and ethical considerations as they pertain to communication robots utilized in law enforcement. In the following, the authors explain their primary research thrusts and provide their plan for expanded stakeholder involvement for future research. For the future work, the authors will work with stakeholders to develop ethically grounded communication robots and accompanying education programs that enhance communication, trust, transparency, and accessibility between LEOs and citizens communities.},

  abstract={Hybrid Simulation (HS) is the application of two or more simulation techniques (e.g., ABS, DES, SD) in a single M&S study. Distinct from HS, Hybrid Modelling (HM) is defined as the combined application of simulation approaches (including HS) with methods and techniques from the broader OR/MS literature and also across disciplines. In this paper, we expand on the unified conceptual representation and classification of hybrid M&S, which includes both HS (Model Types A-C), hybrid OR/MS models (D, D.1) and cross-disciplinary hybrid models (Type E), and assess their innovation potential. We argue that model types associated with HM (D, D.1, E), with its focus on OR/MS and cross-disciplinary research, are particularly well-placed in driving innovation in the theory and practice of M&S. Application of these innovative HM methodologies will lead to innovation in the application space as new approaches in stakeholder engagement, conceptual modelling, system representation, V&V, experimentation, etc. are identified.},

  abstract={Engineering firms continue to adopt the practice of virtual teams, which face unique challenges and require additional management considerations than co-located teams. While virtual teams offer incentives in terms of flexibility and cost savings, engineering firms should be aware of added challenges that yield low-performing teams or result in failure. These challenges, in essence, are driven by the geographic dispersion of members, core reliance on communication technology, and composition of various cultures. The subject research follows a highly practical approach, providing specific practices for mitigation of the identified challenges. A survey study was conducted to gather data from engineering practitioners at a global professional services firm involved in virtual engineering projects between 2017 and 2018. Research conducted across best practices for virtual teams, coupled with the survey results, yielded a framework of five overarching themes to enable high-performing virtual engineering teams: technology integration, management of virtual resources, project governance controls, stakeholder engagement, and organizational drivers. Resulting practices are presented across the five themes of the framework. The findings should be leveraged by engineering and technology professionals involved in virtual projects, along with leaders and firm executives seeking improved performance of their virtual teams.},

  abstract={Less than 3% of the 145 million blind people living in developing countries are literate. This low literacy rate is partly due to the lack of trained teachers and the challenges associated with learning to write Braille on a traditional slate and stylus. These challenges include writing from right to left, writing mirrored images of letters, and receiving significantly delayed feedback. Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind near Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost Braille writing tutor. We present an iterative and participatory design process resulting in the creation and refinement of a prototype Braille writing tutor system. This system uses a novel input device to capture a student's activity on a slate using a stylus and uses a range of techniques to teach Braille writing skills to both beginner and advanced students. We report on lessons learned from the implementation of this project and from a six-week pilot study at the Mathru school, and outline future directions for improvement.},

  abstract={Elicitation studies have become a popular method of participatory design. While traditionally used to examine unimodal gesture interactions, elicitation has started being used with other novel interaction modalities. Unfortunately, there has been no work that examines the impact of referent display on elicited interaction proposals. To address that concern this work provides a detailed comparison between two elicitation studies that were similar in design apart from the way that participants were prompted for interaction proposals (i.e., the referents). Based on this comparison the impact of referent display on speech and gesture interaction proposals are each discussed. The interaction proposals between these elicitation studies were not identical. Gesture proposals were the least impacted by referent display, showing high proposal similarity between the two works. Speech proposals were highly biased by text referents with proposals directly mirroring text-based referents an average of 69.36% of the time. In short, the way that referents are presented during elicitation studies can impact the resulting interaction proposals; however, the level of impact found is dependent on the modality of input elicited.},

  abstract={Law enforcement and domain experts can detect human trafficking (HT) in online escort websites by analyzing suspicious clusters of connected ads. How can we explain clustering results intuitively and interactively, visualizing potential evidence for experts to analyze? We present TrafficVis, the first interface for cluster-level HT detection and labeling. Developed through months of participatory design with domain experts, TrafficVis provides coordinated views in conjunction with carefully chosen backend algorithms to effectively show spatio-temporal and text patterns to a wide variety of anti-HT stakeholders. We build upon state-of-the-art text clustering algorithms by incorporating shared metadata as a signal of connected and possibly suspicious activity, then visualize the results. Domain experts can use TrafficVis to label clusters as HT, or other, suspicious, but non-HT activity such as spam and scam, quickly creating labeled datasets to enable further HT research. Through domain expert feedback and a usage scenario, we demonstrate TRAFFICVIS's efficacy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with repeated high praises for the usability and explainability of our tool, the latter being vital for indicting possible criminals.},

  pages={44-49},
  abstract={Gamification has been widely touted as a useful approach in motivating learners to learn subjects that are perceived as challenging, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This paper reports the process of considering various cultural and social factors in the design of educational games using game design thinking approach. Educational games for STEM subjects were designed and developed through an iteration process that considered the contextual significance of learners' diverse cultural backgrounds. Online and traditional games were used as sources of inspiration, and they were re-designed to fit with learner's interests and context. The findings from 42 learners who played the role as the game designers showed significant impact of the empathy stage in the design loop where cultural elements were shared and integrated into the design. The participatory design approach proves to be very useful in encouraging learners to provide their ideas. Some learners who had limited exposure to computer or video games were still able to combine suitable game mechanics and draw ideas from their surroundings to create their own games. The findings also reveal differing viewpoints of urban and rural learners with regards to use of games of learning. The outcomes from this study provided valuable insights in the formulation of a framework for game design that takes into account learners' diversity.},

  abstract={Inspired by data comics, this paper introduces a novel format for reporting controlled studies in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI). While many studies in HCI follow similar steps in explaining hypotheses, laying out a study design, and reporting results, many of these decisions are buried in blocks of dense scientific text. We propose leveraging data comics as study reports to provide an open and glanceable view of studies by tightly integrating text and images, illustrating design decisions and key insights visually, resulting in visual narratives that can be compelling to non-scientists and researchers alike. Use cases of data comics study reports range from illustrations for non-scientific audiences to graphical abstracts, study summaries, technical talks, textbooks, teaching, blogs, supplementary submission material, and inclusion in scientific articles. This paper provides examples of data comics study reports alongside a graphical repertoire of examples, embedded in a framework of guidelines for creating comics reports which was iterated upon and evaluated through a series of collaborative design sessions.},

  number={4},
  pages={2607-2615},
  abstract={This paper mainly studies the modeling, stability analysis and proportional-integral (PI) controller design for a class of discrete-time cascade control systems (CCSs). In the existing CCSs for solving gain of the controller, the controller mostly adopts the proportional (P) controller, but the most commonly used controller in industrial production is PI controller. Based on the actual demand in industry and in order to obtain a better control effect, the design problem of primary and secondary controllers in a class of discrete cascade control is considered, in which the primary controller adopts a PI controller and the secondary controller adopts a P controller. On this basis, the model of cascade control system (CCS) is established. Then, we can create a new Lyapunov functional, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the system is given. Then, the collaborative design method of primary PI controller and secondary P controller is given by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, a simulation example of a main steam temperature with CCS structure is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The PI controller is better than the existing P controller, this method has not only the rapidity of P control, but also the ability of integral control to eliminate steady-state errors. Note to Practitioners—The inspiration of this paper comes from the adjustment of plant controller parameters. The PI controller is the most widely used controller in the existing industrial production, but the adjustment of proportional and integral parameters of the controller is a very troublesome thing. In order to obtain a better controller parameters, a professional engineer may spend a whole day to adjust the parameters. This paper can design the solution of the primary and secondary controller parameters to stabilize the CCS at the same time by LMI technique, which can greatly reduce the work of adjusting the controller parameters. Through simulation, we can know that this method can make the system stable, which shows this method is feasible.},

Characterized by profit, people, and planet, the supply chain processes of creating values and managing risks are expected to be digitally transformed. Once digitized, datafied, and networked, supply chains can account for substantial progress towards sustainability. Given the lack of clarity on the concepts of resilience and human rights for the supply chain, especially with the recent advancement of social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, the study conducts a scoping review. To identify the size, scope, and themes, it collected 180 articles from the Web of Science bibliographic database. The bibliometric findings reveal the overall conceptual and intellectual structure, and the gaps for further research and development. The concept of resilience can be enriched, for instance, by the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. The enriched notion of resilience can also be expressed in digitized, datafied, and networked forms.},

  abstract={This article describes the story of pragmatism and its transformation into symbolic interactionism at Carnegie Mellon University and Aalto University. In both universities, design researchers were interested in user experience in interactive systems. John Dewey's pragmatism taught them to study how experience sometimes transforms into an experience and occasionally into stories. Herbert Blumer's interactionism had its roots in Chicago School sociology, and it developed in association with pragmatism. His interactionism gave these researchers tools to study Dewey's concepts empirically. We show in the article how this theoretical connection came about after 2000 and how it has shaped research programs in these two communities since then. We also discuss the relevance of pragmatism and interactionism in our current technological landscape, dominated by social media and artificial intelligence.},

It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems. Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied. This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them. Our results show that both agile and services make the end-toend analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions. Additionally, we open a new research avenue pointing to Amazon Macie as an example of Machine Learning applications that aim to provide a solution to the scalability and usability of Privacy Threat Modeling processes.},

  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) is a promising paradigm that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet, Internet of People, and many Internet-based paradigms to transform the industry, society, and people lives. It provides seamless integration of intelligent devices – with sensing, identification, processing, communication, networking capabilities, Big Data (machine learning, analytics, and distributed computing), and human sensors (collaboration, intelligent cognition, and social networks). IoE brings excellent opportunities to improve changes in society with collaborative intelligent systems. However, these new technologies also bring significant challenges and do not address major existing issues, including interoperability, reliability, and intelligence management. Awareness of these issues is required before IoE applications can be widely deployed. This work introduces an observatory for cataloging IoE applications. Registering these applications will support researchers, developers, and users to exchange more information, design improved IoE applications, facilitating the composition of different enablers (human and non-humans). The main contributions of this work include the proposal of a technology platform, the IoE Database (IoEDB), that enables the distributed and collaborative cataloging of IoE initiatives and provides the evolution of a ‘live’ IoE knowledge-based taxonomy to support interoperability and awareness of IoE enablers.},

  title={Composition of Resource-Service Chain Based on Evolutionary Algorithm in Distributed Cloud Manufacturing Systems},
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={19911-19920},
  abstract={In distributed cloud manufacturing (CMfg) systems, multi-resource service can complete more complex manufacturing tasks than single resource service. Especially in business process, all the resource services are invoked in a certain sequence, which is called the Resource-Service Chain (RSC). The RSC, as a sequential composition of resource services, expresses the scheduling and the flow of servicing to a distributed business process. A perfect composition can improve utilization ratio and efficient matching availability of resource services greatly. However, most of the existing methods for resource service composition paid no attention to the temporal relationship between resource services. Moreover, the methods strongly depend on relevant element to be considered. Inspired by biological evolution, a Resource-Service Chain Composition Evolutionary (RSCCE) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, RSCCE tries to find multiple optimal solutions, namely all RSCs in a workflow with given constraints. To begin, initial sets of composite resource service are resolved by calculating the degree of dependency between resource services, so as to obtain initial RSCs by workflow. Then, RSCCE algorithm applies genetic algorithm to search for the extended of each initial RSC, a longer chain composing of it, to improve the reuse of RSC. Under this approach, gene and chromosome represent resource service and the entire RSC respectively. If the propagated chromosomes violate the sequence of resource service, as constraint in RSCCE algorithm, they will be repaired to obtain a valid solution. Finally, we take a multi-enterprise collaborative business process as an example to simulate our approach. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.},

  title={Identifying the Components and Interrelationships of Smart Cities in Indonesia: Supporting Policymaking via Fuzzy Cognitive Systems},
  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={46136-46151},
  abstract={Multiple Indonesian cities currently aim to qualify as “smart cities.” Previous research on defining smart cities (e.g., the implementation-oriented maturity model) tends to focus on components over interrelationships, is challenging to apply to a specific context such as Indonesia, and offers limited support for policy-relevant questions. In this paper, we propose to address these shortcomings to support policymakers in identifying concrete action plans in Indonesia specifically. Our approach clarifies interrelationships for the context of use and supports structural (e.g., what aspects of a “smart city” are impacted by an intervention?) as well as what-if policy questions. We started with a systems' science approach to developing a cognitive map of the components and their interrelationships, as is increasingly done in participatory modeling and particularly in socio-ecological management. We transformed semi-structured interviews of 10 Indonesian experts into maps and assembled them to create the first comprehensive smart cities cognitive map for Indonesia, totaling 52 concepts and 98 relationships. While a cognitive map already provides support for decision-making (e.g., by identifying loops in the system), it is only conceptual and thus cannot form predictions. Consequently, we extended our cognitive map into a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), whose inference abilities allow to examine the dynamic response of an indicator (e.g., “smart city”) in response to different interventions. As fuzzy cognitive maps include the strengths of interrelationships but not the notion of time, future research may refine our model using system dynamics. This refinement would support policymakers in investigating when to conduct and/or evaluate an intervention.},

  volume={6},

  pages={52355-52365},
  abstract={Nonhealing wounds pose a major challenge in clinical medicine. Typical chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, have brought substantial difficulties to millions of patients around the world. The management of chronic wound care remains challenging in terms of precise wound size measurement, comprehensive wound assessment, timely wound healing monitoring, and efficient wound case management. Despite the rapid progress of digital health technologies in recent years, practical smart wound care management systems are yet to be developed. One of the main difficulties is in-depth communication and interaction with nurses and doctors throughout the complex wound care process. This paper presents a systematic approach for the user-centered design and development of a new smart mobile system for the management of chronic wound care that manages the nurse's task flow and meets the requirements for the care of different types of wounds in both clinic and hospital wards. The system evaluation and satisfaction review was carried out with a group of ten nurses from various clinical departments after using the system for over one month. The survey results demonstrated high effectiveness and usability of the smart mobile system for chronic wound care management, in contrast to the traditional pen-and-paper approach, in busy clinical contexts.},

  abstract={A smart contract, in form, is represented as a piece of computer program code involving related commercial transactions and algorithms. Essentially, this is the computerization of the pre-agreed contract between the participants. This special contract agreement is automatically verified and executed once preset conditions are triggered. Smart contracts are not only used in the field of financial transactions, but also include many aspects of social life. Although smart contract technology has unique advantages, it is still in the early stages of development, and many problems remain to be solved. First, this article briefly summarizes the development process of blockchain, and then focuses on the research progress of blockchain 2.0-smart contracts. Second, the related concepts of smart contracts are presented, and the working mechanism of smart contracts and the difficulties faced by smart contracts are elaborated. Finally, in response to these problems and dilemmas, the corresponding solutions and ideas are summarized, and the future challenges and development trends of smart contracts are analyzed and judged.},

  pages={12675-12692},
  abstract={In an effort towards the democratization of Robotics, this article presents a novel End-User Development framework called Robot Interfaces From Zero Experience (RIZE). The framework provides a set of useful software tools for the creation of robot-oriented software architectures and programming interfaces, as well as the modeling and execution of robot behaviors, with a specific emphasis on social behaviors. Programming interfaces built on top of RIZE enable professionals with different backgrounds and interests to design, adapt, and scale-up robotics applications. As an example of a programming interface, we present Open RIZE, which exploits an End-User Programming paradigm combining blocks, tables, and forms-filling interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, robot behavioral code generated by Open RIZE is intrinsically modular, re-usable, scalable, neutral to the employed programming language, and platform-agnostic. In the article, we present the main design guidelines and features of Open RIZE. Additionally, we perform an initial usability evaluation of the Open RIZE interface in an online workshop. Preliminary results using the System Usability Scale with 10 novice end-users indicate that Open RIZE is easy-to-use and learn.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={117486-117495},
  abstract={Automatic object removal with obstructed façades completion in the urban environment is essential for many applications such as scene restoration, environmental impact assessment, and urban mapping. However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background façade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and façade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building façades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.},

  number={},
  pages={14734-14746},
  abstract={This paper presents a low-area and energy-efficient hardware accelerator for the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Based on the multiply-accumulate-based architecture, three design techniques are proposed to reduce the hardware cost of the convolutional computations. First, to reduce the computational cost of convolutions, an adaptive bit-width reduction combined with near-zero skipping is proposed based on differential input method (DIM). The DIM-based design technique can reduce 62.5% of operation bit-width and improve 17.0% of activation sparsity with almost ignorable CNN accuracy degradation. Second, it has been found that adopting a bi-directional filtering window in a CNN accelerator can considerably reduce the energy for data movement with a much smaller number of memory accesses. To expedite the bi-directional filtering operations, we also propose a bi-directional first-input-first-output (bi-FIFO). With SRAM bit-cell layout manner, the proposed bi-FIFO facilitates fast data re-distribution with area and energy efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, the AlexNet accelerator has been designed. The numerical results show that the proposed adaptive bit-width reduction scheme achieves 34.6% and 58.2% of area and energy savings, respectively. The bi-FIFO-based accelerator also achieves 32.8% improved processing time.},

  abstract={Industrial design is a requisite and incontrovertible front-end design for Industrie 4.0 to realize personalization, agility, intelligence, and standardization, so it has very important practical significance to achieve industrial design collaborative workflow flexible management. This paper proposed a hierarchical colored Petri net (HCPN) for modeling the industrial design collaborative system workflow, which aims to provide a valid workflow model for the process management of the industrial design collaborative system. First, it is built the top-level workflow CPN model from product planning, markets research, product design, and product evaluation to prototype production, then the model is extended layer by layer to build the subnet model by the model refinement method. In the model, the activity of the workflow and the activity execution results are represented by the transitions ( $T$ ) and places ( $S$ ), respectively. The running state of the whole workflow is represented by the distribution of the token in the places. The token’ color sets expresses the real-time discrete state. By use of the function of token coloring places ( $S$ ) and the token’ color sets of HCPN, this paper extracts the common characteristics of process knowledge, including markets research results, design ideas, conceptual sketches, design schemes, human resources, and tacit creative knowledge, then uses the what, when, where, who, and how method to build knowledge information units for specific design event. Thus, realizes the industrial design process knowledge base construction and knowledge acquisition, which provides the necessary information and knowledge resources for the design reuse, flexibility management, and intelligent manufacturing of subsequent products.},

  pages={51049-51060},
  abstract={Software development is incredibly complex. Specifically, open-source software (OSS) development requires developers to collaborate with each other to conduct their work. Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the OSS projects (e.g., bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, and so on) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on OSS projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: social network analysis, DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting overtime. DSNs over time are considered a small-world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55% diversity with 75% of evenness between the developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment. Moreover, DSNs over time have a few developers as core members and large developers as peripheral members. Finally, about 10% of developers changed their positions frequently over time.},

  abstract={The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the interest in new software tools to monitor the computer-based activities of employees working remotely (teleworking), and the demand for better analytics functionalities to be offered, focusing on employees’ performance and work-life balance. In this paper, we aim to analyze the habits of teleworking employees based on their interaction with the computer: how the employees are involved in different types of activities (actual work, recreation, documentation), and which are the most intensive periods. A conceptual framework for workforce analytics was developed for this purpose, together with tools and applications, that can provide useful information on different categories of activities where employees are involved. Knowledge generation is performed in four phases: collecting, processing, organizing, and analyzing the data to create valuable insights for the organization. Based on this framework, we developed a case study in an IT company, where two categories of employees, developers and software consultants, were monitored for 114 days, with 3.5 million events being generated and processed. The results showed different habits for consultants and developers, in terms of working activity structure, working schedule, inactivity time and interaction with the computer. Differences were also identified when we compared our results with previous research that monitored software developers working in-house: remote workers tend to organize their program for a longer period during the workday, and spend less time on meetings but longer time for programming. On the other hand, both categories of employees (in-house and teleworkers) show highly fragmented work, switching windows after very short periods of activity, with a potential negative impact on productivity, progress on tasks, and quality of output. The research results can be used in future employee productivity studies when searching answers to a fundamental question for workforce analytics – why are some employees more productive than others?},

  abstract={Human values (e.g., pleasure, privacy, and social justice) are what a person or a society considers important. Inability to address them in software-intensive systems can result in numerous undesired consequences (e.g., financial losses) for individuals and communities. Various solutions (e.g., methodologies, techniques) are developed to help “operationalize values in software”. The ultimate goal is to ensure building software (better) reflects and respects human values. In this survey, “operationalizing values” is referred to as the process of identifying human values and translating them to accessible and concrete concepts so that they can be implemented, validated, verified, and measured in software. This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle. However, the later phases (implementation and testing) and other aspects of software development (e.g., “team organization”) still need adequate consideration. We outline implications for research and practice and identify open issues and future research directions to advance this area.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={33661-33678},
  abstract={In today’s data-driven world, decision makers are facing many conflicting objectives. Since there is usually no solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously, the aim is to identify a solution with acceptable trade-offs. Interactive multiobjective optimization methods are iterative processes in which a human decision maker repeatedly provides one’s preferences to request computing new solutions and compares them. With these methods, the decision maker can learn about the problem and its limitations. However, advanced optimization software usually offer simple visualization tools that can be significantly improved. On the other hand, current approaches for multiobjective optimization from the visualization community provide superior visualization tools but lack advanced optimization. In this paper, we introduce a new term, interactivize, for integrating interactive multiobjective optimization and interactive visualization and present an interactivized approach supporting decision makers in visually steering interactive multiobjective optimization methods. We integrate state-of-the-art interactive visualization with the process of interactive multiobjective optimization in a visual analytics solution that significantly improves the analysis workflow of decision makers, like comparing selected solutions and specifying new preferences during the iterative solution process. To realize the new interactivized approach, we combine a coordinated multiple views system with DESDEO, an open-source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization. We demonstrate our interactivized approach on a river pollution problem.},

A family of experiments is a method of verification whereby we can check if the experimental results are reproducible. Through comparison with the updated control tool Creately, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the usability of the collaborative modeling chatbot and how it could be improved based on experimental evidence of changes in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction, and quality. A total of 87 students from three countries were recruited. We conducted a family of three experiments to compare the usability of SOCIO V1 and updated Creately in academic settings. Students appeared to be more satisfied with SOCIO V1, and SOCIO V1 scored better on completeness. There were no significant differences between the two tools regarding efficiency and quality. This study provides evidence on how to employ a family of experiments to improve chatbot usability and enrich knowledge on chatbot usability experimentation.},

This resulted in a neuroaesthetic shape grammar that is led by the designer and complementary to human intuition and algorithmic logic.

  year={2006},
  volume={36},
  number={4},
  pages={563-577},
  abstract={Manufacturing process planning is the process of selecting and sequencing manufacturing processes such that they achieve one or more goals and satisfy a set of domain constraints. Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems.

  abstract={The boom in the capabilities and features of mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets, and wearables, combined with the ubiquitous and affordable Internet access and the advances in the areas of cooperative networking, computer vision, and mobile cloud computing transformed mobile augmented reality (MAR) from science fiction to a reality. Although mobile devices are more constrained computationalwise from traditional computers, they have a multitude of sensors that can be used to the development of more sophisticated MAR applications and can be assisted from remote servers for the execution of their intensive parts. In this paper, after introducing the reader to the basics of MAR, we present a categorization of the application fields together with some representative examples. Next, we introduce the reader to the user interface and experience in MAR applications and continue with the core system components of the MAR systems. After that, we discuss advances in tracking and registration, since their functionality is crucial to any MAR application and the network connectivity of the devices that run MAR applications together with its importance to the performance of the application. We continue with the importance of data management in MAR systems and the systems performance and sustainability, and before we conclude this survey, we present existing challenging problems.},

  volume={23},

  pages={1706-1724},
  abstract={Augmented Reality is a technique that enables users to interact with their physical environment through the overlay of digital information. While being researched for decades, more recently, Augmented Reality moved out of the research labs and into the field. While most of the applications are used sporadically and for one particular task only, current and future scenarios will provide a continuous and multi-purpose user experience. Therefore, in this paper, we present the concept of Pervasive Augmented Reality, aiming to provide such an experience by sensing the user's current context and adapting the AR system based on the changing requirements and constraints. We present a taxonomy for Pervasive Augmented Reality and context-aware Augmented Reality, which classifies context sources and context targets relevant for implementing such a context-aware, continuous Augmented Reality experience. We further summarize existing approaches that contribute towards Pervasive Augmented Reality. Based our taxonomy and survey, we identify challenges for future research directions in Pervasive Augmented Reality.},

  abstract={Microservices are a new trend rising fast from the enterprise world. Even though the design principles around microservices have been identified, it is difficult to have a clear view of existing research solutions for architecting microservices. In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology to identify, classify, and evaluate the current state of the art on architecting microservices from the following three perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption. More specifically, we systematically define a classification framework for categorizing the research on architecting microservices and we rigorously apply it to the 71 selected studies. We synthesize the obtained data and produce a clear overview of the state of the art. This gives a solid basis to plan for future research and applications of architecting microservices.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a new generation of secure information technology that is fueling business and industrial innovation. Many studies on key enabling technologies for resource organization and system operation of blockchain-secured smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 had been conducted. However, the progression and promotion of these blockchain applications have been fundamentally impeded by various issues in scalability, flexibility, and cybersecurity. This survey discusses how blockchain systems can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this regard, eight cybersecurity issues (CIs) are identified in manufacturing systems. Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature. Based on insights obtained from this analysis, future research directions for blockchain-secured smart manufacturing are presented, which potentially guides research on urgent cybersecurity concerns for achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Data surrounds each and every one of us in our daily lives, ranging from exercise logs, to archives of our interactions with others on social media, to online resources pertaining to our hobbies. There is enormous potential for us to use these data to understand ourselves better and make positive changes in our lives. Visualization (Vis) and visual analytics (VA) offer substantial opportunities to help individuals gain insights about themselves, their communities and their interests; however, designing tools to support data analysis in non-professional life brings a unique set of research and design challenges. We investigate the requirements and research directions required to take full advantage of Vis and VA in a personal context. We develop a taxonomy of design dimensions to provide a coherent vocabulary for discussing personal visualization and personal visual analytics. By identifying and exploring clusters in the design space, we discuss challenges and share perspectives on future research. This work brings together research that was previously scattered across disciplines. Our goal is to call research attention to this space and engage researchers to explore the enabling techniques and technology that will support people to better understand data relevant to their personal lives, interests, and needs.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={92-104},
  abstract={Requirements elicitation research is reviewed using a framework categorising the relative `knowness' of requirements specification and Common Ground discourse theory. The main contribution of this survey is to review requirements elicitation from the perspective of this framework and propose a road map of research to tackle outstanding elicitation problems involving tacit knowledge. Elicitation techniques (interviews, scenarios, prototypes, etc.) are investigated, followed by representations, models and support tools. The survey results suggest that elicitation techniques appear to be relatively mature, although new areas of creative requirements are emerging. Representations and models are also well established although there is potential for more sophisticated modelling of domain knowledge. While model-checking tools continue to become more elaborate, more growth is apparent in NL tools such as text mining and IR which help to categorize and disambiguate requirements. Social collaboration support is a relatively new area that facilitates categorisation, prioritisation and matching collections of requirements for product line versions. A road map for future requirements elicitation research is proposed investigating the prospects for techniques, models and tools in green-field domains where few solutions exist, contrasted with brown-field domains where collections of requirements and products already exist. The paper concludes with remarks on the possibility of elicitation tackling the most difficult question of `unknown unknown' requirements.},

  abstract={Due to increased competitive pressure, modern organizations tend to rely on knowledge and its exploitation to sustain a long-term advantage. This calls for a precise understanding of knowledge management (KM) processes and, specifically, how knowledge is created, shared/transferred, acquired, stored/retrieved, and applied throughout an organizational system. However, since the beginning of the new millennium, such KM processes have been deeply affected and molded by the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, which involves the interconnectedness of machines and their ability to learn and share data autonomously. For this reason, the present article investigates the intellectual structure and trends of KM in Industry 4.0. Bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review are conducted on a total of 90 relevant articles. The results reveal six clusters of keywords, subsequently explored via a systematic literature review to identify potential stream of this emergent field and future research avenues capable of producing meaningful advances in managerial knowledge of Industry 4.0 and its consequences.},

  pages={6074-6087},
  abstract={Since the early 20th century, inventors have conceptualized “plane cars” and other urban aerial transportation. Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) “flying car” concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics.},

  abstract={In recent years, the investigations on cyber-physical systems (CPS) have become increasingly popular in both academia and industry. A primary obstruction against the booming deployment of CPS applications lies in how to process and manage large amounts of generated data for decision making. To tackle this predicament, researchers advocate the idea of coupling edge computing, or edge-cloud computing into the design of CPS. However, this coupling process raises a diversity of challenges to the quality-of-services (QoS) of CPS applications. In this article, we present a survey on edge computing or edge-cloud computing assisted CPS designs from the QoS optimization perspective. We first discuss critical challenges in service latency, energy consumption, security, privacy, and reliability during the integration of CPS with edge computing or edge-cloud computing. Afterwards, we give an overview on the state-of-the-art works tackling different challenges for QoS optimization, and present a systematic classification during outlining literature for highlighting their similarities and differences. We finally summarize the experiences learned from surveyed works and envision future research directions on edge computing or edge-cloud computing assisted CPS optimization.},

  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={78779-78807},
  abstract={This paper presents a systematic review of relevant primary studies on the use of augmented reality (AR) to improve various skills of children and adolescents diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from years 2005 to 2018 inclusive in eight bibliographic databases. This systematic review attempts to address eleven specific research questions related to the learing skills, participants, AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, evaluation parameters, intervention outcomes, generalization, and maintenance. The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible. The review also proposes the research taxonomy for ASD. Future research addressing the effectiveness of AR among more participants, different technologies supporting AR for the intervention, generalization, and maintenance of learning skills, and the evaluation in the inslusive classroom environment and other settings is warranted.},

  abstract={Awareness is building on how managers should be involved in Industry 4.0 cybersecurity. This awareness and concern derives from heavy dependence of integrated information systems and technology for Industry 4.0. Manufacturing companies rely on data to run their operations. The Internet of Things is exponentially increasing the number of entry points for organizations to defend from nefarious actors. Complex digital value chains expose firms to risks beyond their direct control. The potential damage of cyberattacks is substantial in terms of continuity of business operations, theft of confidential information, and reputational harm. Even with this mounting sense of urgency, there is increasing confusion on what needs to be done and how. C-suite executives and entrepreneurs are puzzled due to the complexity of issues and concerns. Cybersecurity professionals, for their part, often fail to make the issue relevant and accessible to non-technical stakeholders. In this paper, we clarify why Industry 4.0 requires an evolving cybersecurity perspective. We identify where current approaches fall short and what emerging practices are gaining relevance. Our analysis is based on discussions with senior executives and an extensive literature review of academic papers and practical reports.},

  abstract={World leaders and scientists have been putting immense efforts into strengthening energy security and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by meeting growing energy demand for the last couple of decades. Their efforts accelerate the need for large-scale renewable energy resources (RER) integration into existing electricity grids. The intermittent nature of the dominant RER, e.g., solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems, poses operational and technical challenges in their effective integration by hampering network reliability and stability. This article reviews and discusses the challenges reported due to the grid integration of solar PV systems and relevant proposed solutions. Among various technical challenges, it reviews the non-dispatch-ability, power quality, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability related to solar PV systems grid integration. Also, it addresses relevant socio-economic, environmental, and electricity market challenges. Finally, it highlights the proposed solution methodologies, including grid codes, advanced control strategies, energy storage systems, and renewable energy policies to combat the discussed challenges. The findings of this article assist the power system scholars and researchers in conducting further research in this field. Furthermore, it helps the decision-makers to choose the appropriate technologies to deal with the anticipated challenges associated with the grid integration of PV systems.},

  year={2022},
  volume={24},

  pages={1175-1211},
  abstract={Network slicing has been widely agreed as a promising technique to accommodate diverse services for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.},

  pages={1902-1923},
  abstract={Cognitive radio technologies enable users to opportunistically access unused licensed spectrum and are viewed as a promising way to deal with the current spectrum crisis. Over the last 15 years, cognitive radio technologies have been extensively studied from algorithmic design to practical implementation. One pressing and fundamental problem is how to integrate cognitive radios into current wireless networks to enhance network capacity and improve users' experience. Unfortunately, existing solutions to cognitive radio networks (CRNs) suffer from many practical design issues. To foster further research activities in this direction, we attempt to provide a tutorial for CRN architecture design. Noticing that an effective architecture for CRNs is still lacking, in this tutorial, we systematically summarize the principles for CRN architecture design and present a novel flexible network architecture, termed cognitive capacity harvesting network (CCHN), to elaborate on how a CRN architecture can be designed. Unlike existing architectures, we introduce a new network entity, called secondary service provider, and deploy cognitive radio capability enabled routers, called cognitive radio routers, in order to effectively and efficiently manage resource harvesting and mobile traffic while enabling users without cognitive radios to access and enjoy CCHN services. Our analysis shows that our CCHN aligns well to industrial standardization activities and hence provides a viable approach to implementing future CRNs. We hope that our proposed design approach opens a new venue to future CRN research.},

  abstract={Recommendation systems in software engineering (SE) should be designed to integrate evidence into practitioners experience. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a natural statistical framework for evidence-based decision-making by incorporating an integrated summary of the available evidence and associated uncertainty (of consequences). In this study, we follow the lead of computational biology and healthcare decision-making, and investigate the applications of BNs in SE in terms of 1) main software engineering challenges addressed, 2) techniques used to learn causal relationships among variables, 3) techniques used to infer the parameters, and 4) variable types used as BN nodes. We conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate each of these four facets and compare the current usage of BNs in SE with these two domains. Subsequently, we highlight the main limitations of the usage of BNs in SE and propose a Hybrid BN to improve evidence-based decision-making in SE. In two industrial cases, we build sample hybrid BNs and evaluate their performance. The results of our empirical analyses show that hybrid BNs are powerful frameworks that combine expert knowledge with quantitative data. As researchers in SE become more aware of the underlying dynamics of BNs, the proposed models will also advance and naturally contribute to evidence based-decision-making.},

  pages={1437-1456},
  abstract={Multicarrier energy systems (MCESs) are characterized by strong coordination in operation and planning across multiple energy vectors and/or sectors to deliver reliable, cost-effective energy services to end users/customers with minimal impact on the environment. They have efficiency and flexibility benefits and are deployed in large and small scales on the supply and demand sides and at the network level but are more complex to control and manage. In this article, MCESs are reviewed in the context of future low carbon energy systems based on electrification and very high variable renewable energy penetrations. Fully exploiting these systems requires some cost reductions, more sophisticated operations enabled by standardized communications and control capabilities detailed planning paradigms, and addressing their corresponding economic challenges. All these point toward the direction of analysis, markets, and technology research and development coupled with better policy and regulatory frameworks. One futuristic vision of a very low carbon energy system is proposed that illustrates potential pathways to an MCES-dominated energy future.},

  abstract={Smart musical instruments (SMIs) are a family of Internet of Musical Things devices for music creation. They are characterized by sensors, actuators, embedded intelligence, and wireless connectivity to local networks and to the Internet. In this paper, we depict a vision for this recent research area, which merges the research fields on digital musical instruments and smart objects, and fosters new types of interactions between the player and the instrument, between the player and other players, and between the player and audience members. We propose a set of capabilities and technical features characterizing SMIs, as well as a design for a technological architecture supporting them. To illustrate possible applications enabled by this vision, we present a set of scenarios exploiting the intelligence embedded in SMIs. We also propose a set of guidelines that can help digital luthiers in the process of designing SMIs. Finally, we present a set of directions for future research.},

  abstract={Social network analysis (SNA) has been a research focus in multiple disciplines for decades, including sociology, healthcare, business management, etc. Traditional SNA researches concern more human and social science aspects—trying to undermine the real relationship of people and the impacts of these relationships. While online social networks have become popular in recent years, social media analysis, especially from the viewpoint of computer scientists, is usually limited to the aspects of people's behavior on specific websites and thus are considered not necessarily related to the day-to-day people's behavior and relationships. We conduct research to bridge the gap between social scientists and computer scientists by exploring the multifacet existing social networks in organizations that provide better insights on how people interact with each other in their professional life. We describe a comprehensive study on the challenges and solutions of mining and analyzing existing social networks in enterprise. Several aspects are considered, including system issues; privacy laws; the economic value of social networks; people's behavior modeling including channel, culture, and social inference; social network visualization in large-scale organization; and graph query and mining. The study is based on an SNA tool (SmallBlue) that was designed to overcome practical challenges and is based on the data collected in a global organization of more than 400 000 employees in more than 100 countries.},

  abstract={Since distance education creates new opportunities for learners, the enrollment in online courses has been sharply increasing in higher education. However, the higher attrition rate is one of the more significant concerns in this field. Educational researchers have found that meaningful interactions play a significant role in learner persistence in online courses. Still, it is challenging for an individual instructor to promote learners' positive interaction experiences. The expectation of improved learners' interaction with conversational agent systems has received attention in the distance education field. Few conversational agent systems have been developed for educational purposes, and few systems are used in real online learning settings. This study aims at designing and developing a conversational agent system to promote the learner's meaningful interaction in online courses, and also exploring the feasibility of human interaction with the conversational agent system, or chatbot, in online courses in higher education. The primary findings of this study show that instant, content-related, and quality interactions between the learner and the conversational agent system is applicable to graduate-level online courses. Implications and future research are discussed.},

  abstract={The current institution-based model for healthcare service delivery faces enormous challenges posed by an aging population and the prevalence of chronic diseases. For this reason, pervasive healthcare, i.e., the provision of healthcare services to individuals anytime anywhere, has become a major focus for the research community. In this paper, we map out the current state of pervasive healthcare research by presenting an overview of three emerging areas in personalized health monitoring, namely: 1) mobile phone sensing via in-built or external sensors, 2) self-reporting for manually captured health information, such as symptoms and behaviors, and 3) social sharing of health information within the individual's community. Systems deployed in a real-life setting as well as proofs-of-concept for achieving pervasive health are presented, in order to identify shortcomings and increase our understanding of the requirements for the next generation of pervasive healthcare systems addressing these three areas.},

  abstract={Modern scientific data management and analysis usually rely on multiple scientists with diverse expertise. In recent years, such a collaborative effort is often structured and automated by a data flow-oriented process called scientific workflow. However, such workflows may have to be designed and revised among multiple scientists over a long time period. Existing workbenches are single user-oriented and do not support scientific workflow application development in a "collaborative fashion". In this paper, we report our research on the enabling techniques in the aspects of collaboration provenance management and reproduciability. Based on a scientific collaboration ontology, we propose a service-oriented collaboration model supported by a set of composable collaboration primitives and patterns. The collaboration protocols are then applied to support effective concurrency control in the process of collaborative workflow composition. We also report the design and development of Confucius, a service-oriented collaborative scientific workflow composition tool that extends an open-source, single-user development environment.},

  pages={53811-53826},
  abstract={Context: User stories have been widely accepted as artifacts to capture the user requirements in agile software development. They are short pieces of texts in a semi-structured format that express requirements. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer a potential advantage in user story applications. Objective: Conduct a systematic literature review to capture the current state-of-the-art of NLP research on user stories. Method: The search strategy is used to obtain relevant papers from SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to filter the search results. We also use the forward and backward snowballing techniques to obtain more comprehensive results. Results: The search results identified 718 papers published between January 2009 to December 2020. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we identified 38 primary studies that discuss NLP techniques in user stories. Most studies used NLP techniques to extract aspects of who, what, and why from user stories. The purpose of NLP studies in user stories is broad, ranging from discovering defects, generating software artifacts, identifying the key abstraction of user stories, and tracing links between model and user stories. Conclusion: NLP can help system analysts manage user stories. Implementing NLP in user stories has many opportunities and challenges. Considering the exploration of NLP techniques and rigorous evaluation methods is required to obtain quality research. As with NLP research in general, the ability to understand a sentence’s context continues to be a challenge.},

  pages={249-265},
  abstract={In response to public scrutiny of data-driven algorithms, the field of data science has adopted ethics training and principles. Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people&#x0027;s lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance&#x2014;a fundamentally conservative one&#x2014;and why data science&#x0027;s attempts to promote &#x201C;social good&#x201D; dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.},

  abstract={The potential social consequences that may arise as a result of the development and widespread use of ICT are of increasing interest to the general public, policymakers and researchers. Prominent examples include transformations of our concept of privacy when using social networking and other websites, ownership and control of personal data, and the ways crowd-sourced information transform how events are coordinated and how they unfold in real-time. Although there is broad acceptance that questions of professional responsibility are relevant to ICT it is often unclear how this could be achieved or how responsibilities should be defined and managed when considering the potential social consequences of ICT. `Responsible Research and Innovation' (RRI) has emerged in Europe proposing approaches for researchers to identify and consider the potential social consequences and impact of their research outputs within the entire research and innovation lifecycle. First, it asks researchers to take on a practice of critical reflection considering the potential societal impacts of their research outputs, and second to include the general public in a dialogue around the development of research goals and strategy. We discuss findings from interviews conducted with a broad range of stakeholders regarding challenges to identifying, debating and resolving social and ethical concerns associated with ICT research and practice. We also consider how we might extend existing or develop new approaches that facilitate both critical reflection and wider participation within the entire research and innovation lifecycle.},

  pages={1231-1246},
  abstract={Low task execution time and low energy consumption of collaborating mobile human users and robots are important requirements of emerging human-agent-robot teamwork (HART)-centric Tactile Internet applications. In particular, task migration among mobile HART members has emerged as an important research topic, taking different task types, task deadlines, collaborative node capabilities, and mobility patterns into account. We propose a context-aware task migration scheme for efficiently orchestrating the real-time collaboration among human mobile users, central and decentralized computational agents (cloud/cloudlets), and collaborative robots (cobots) across converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) communications infrastructures. We investigate the problem of whether and, if so, when and where a HART-centric task should be best migrated to. For resource-efficient task execution, the migration decision is made according to given task processing capabilities of cloud/cloudlet agents and cobots, task execution deadline, energy consumption of involved cobots and mobile devices, and task migration latency. We evaluate the performance of our context-aware HART-centric task migration scheme and compare it to conventional task execution without migration. Towards this end, we develop an analytical framework for quantifying its performance in terms of a variety of task migration key performance metrics, including task migration gain-overhead ratio, deadline-miss ratio, task response time, and energy consumption efficiency.},

  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  abstract={Supply chain networks are global, multi-modal platforms that are expected to facilitate seamless exchange of physical goods, information across multiple industries and enterprises and stakeholders. Current supply chain information systems are limited in term of providing validated, real-time asset specific business relevant information during its lifecycle. Only one or few stakeholders have information access privilege causing both information asymmetry and inefficiencies in the $35T global supply chain market. Emerging technologies such as IoT and Blockchain democratize "trustworthy" data availability and empower stakeholders to make the right decision at the right time in the most cost-effective manner. Digital supply chain integration is progressively becoming a competitive differentiation of enterprises. Organizations leading to this approach of digital supply chain are rapidly improving their asset utilization and enabling new databased services. This paper presents the idea about relevance of complementary technologies like IoT and Blockchain technology for complete digitization of supply chain. The business case of pallet renting vendor is taken to showcase the use of technology integration to improve efficiency of its supply chain and asset management.},

  abstract={A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs. This user centered approach has proved fruitful, but there exists relatively little work examining the intent and values of the roboticists themselves. Furthermore, we know little of how the values of roboticists influence their own designs. Such knowledge could help designers better reflect on whether their designs effectively convey particular ethics to their users. In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids). Roboticists also see robots as testbeds for learning about humans themselves. We advocate a VSD approach for humanoids that goes beyond engineering disciplines and forces values to the forefront of discussion.},

  abstract={The challenge of Nigeria’s food insecurity in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, insecurity, climate change, population growth, food wastage, etc., is a demanding task. This study addresses Nigeria’s food insecurity challenges by adopting agriculture 4.0 and commercial farming. Using data from six digital libraries, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, and other internet sources, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR using PRISMA) on Nigeria’s agriculture, food security, and agriculture 4.0. Our results show Nigeria’s current agricultural state, threats to food security, and modern digital agriculture technologies. We adapted our SLR findings to develop an implementation framework for agriculture 4.0 in solving Nigeria’s food insecurity challenge in the post-Covid-19 era. Our proposed framework integrates precision agriculture in Nigeria’s food production and the necessary enabling digital technologies in the agri-food supply chain. We analyzed the critical implementation considerations during each agri-food supply chain stage of farming inputs, farming scale, farming approach, farming operation, food processing, food preservation/storage, distribution/logistics, and the final consumers. This study will help researchers, investors, and the government address food security in Nigeria. The implementation of agriculture 4.0 will substantially contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) of #Envision 2030 of the United Nations, for the benefit of Nigeria, Africa, and the entire world.},

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a well-supported and evidence-based treatment for the delays attributed to ASD. Assistive technologies, such as gamification, software apps, computer-based training (Web), and robotics; provide a standardized method of implementing ABA techniques. This review provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of these technologies. The assessed proposals focused on technologies such as Distributed Systems, Image Processing, Gamification, and Robotics. The primary objectives of these tools sought to improve social behavior, attention, communication, and reading skills. Some common limitations found in the literature was a failure to accurately define their target audience, and a failure to comply with the dimensions of ABA as defined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968.},

  abstract={With the popularity of mobile devices and the development of the wireless technologies, humans can be connected ubiquitously. Because of the mobility of the devices, it is a hard task to maintain the end-to-end path between source node and destination node. Researchers have introduced analysis of nodes' social behavior to solve the problem of data dissemination in the networks, which leads to the emersion of the Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). They increase the performance of data forwarding by the social relationships and interactions among nodes. Many schemes and algorithms have been proposed to enhance data forwarding performance and provide humanized service by introducing social features and digging social properties. In this paper, first, we investigate the architectures and evolutionary process of the MSNs. Then, the social features of nodes existing in the MSNs and main social properties of MSNs are described. In term of the state-of-the-art works, data forwarding strategies in the MSNs are divided into four categories, including only encounter history-based strategies, social-based strategies, incentive mechanisms, and forwarding methods that take social selfishness into consideration of this paper. Finally, the major issues and challenges are discussed.},

  abstract={This paper presents a developed device to solve the problem of moving and navigating of visually impaired and blind people. This device, called Ultrasonic Assistive Headset, is light, simple and low-cost option compared with other assistive devices. Ultrasonic Assistive Headset will guide for them among obstacles by employing ultrasonic distance sensors, microcontroller, voice storage circuit and solar panels to be battery-free. In proposed method, ultrasonic waves arrive to the ultrasonic sensors on the spherical membrane of the headset after sending this waves from ultrasonic distance sensors reflection from obstacles. A microcontroller determines the location of the obstacles according to the sensor ID and the information of distance. The system produces an voice data defining the location, and then it speaks to blind person where the obstacles are. Ultrasonic Assistive Headset can be used easily by them both indoor and outdoor, so they can avoid obstacles quickly and accurately.},

  pages={690-714},
  abstract={Global Software Development (GSD) is a well established field of software engineering with the benefits of a global environment. Software Project Management (SPM) plays a key role in the success of GSD. As a result, the need has arisen to study and evaluate the downsides of SPM for GSD, to thereby pave the way for the development of new methods, techniques, and tools with which to tackle them. This paper aims to identify and classify research on SPM approaches for GSD that are available in the literature, to identify their current weaknesses and strengths, and to analyze their applications in industry. We performed a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on six classification criteria. Eighty-four papers were selected and analyzed. The results indicate that interest in SPM for GSD has been increasing since 2006. As a class of approaches, the most frequently reported methods (40%) are those used for coordination, planning, and monitoring, along with estimation techniques that can be used to better match a distributed project. SPM for GSD requires further investigation by researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to cost and time estimations. These findings will help overcome the challenges that must to be considered in future SPM research for GSD, especially regarding collaboration and time-zone differences.},

Metaverse has a bright future and is expected to have many applications in various scenarios. The support of the Metaverse is based on numerous related technologies becoming mature. Hence, there is no doubt that the security risks of the development of the Metaverse may be more prominent and more complex. We present some Metaverse-related technologies and some potential security and privacy issues in the Metaverse. We present current solutions for Metaverse security and privacy derived from these technologies. In addition, we also raise some unresolved questions about the potential Metaverse. To summarize, this survey provides an in-depth review of the security and privacy issues raised by key technologies in Metaverse applications.

  abstract={A digital pervasive game can be defined as a game in which the gaming experience is extended to the real world. This is possible due to the use of sensor-based mobile devices. Developing digital pervasive games involves additional requirements, such as dealing with ubiquitous computing challenges. Part of these requirements affect directly the design and development processes of pervasive games. Software Engineering techniques should be adapted to increase the overall quality of game software. The main objective of this paper is to present a systematic review of this area in order to capture the state of the art research in Software Engineering for Pervasive Games. A standard systematic review methodology using digital databases for research was applied and 100 relevant studies were found within 1304 obtained from searches. We were able to identify the main topics of pervasive games research area in the last five years, the most relevant research methodologies, topics and challenges in terms of numbers for pervasive games research field.},

  year={2020},
  volume={14},
  number={3},
  pages={3904-3915},
  abstract={As a new computing paradigm, crowd-based cooperative computing aims at effective management and the coordinated use of crowd resources. In crowd-based cooperative task allocation (CBCTA), it is necessary to ensure the suitability and high-quality collaboration of resources for computer supported cooperative work. Generally, the high matching rate between resource and task requirements can achieve the optimal parameter configuration, whereas high-quality collaboration ensures the quality and success rates of crowd-based cooperative task. This article proposes a methodology to optimize the resource allocation model for solving CBCTA problems in a cost-efficient, requirements adapted fashion. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics to find proper resources that optimally balance matching rate and collaborative quality. We also present suitable metrics to quantify the aforementioned targets. Furthermore, the obtained solutions are ranked based on multicriteria decision making to provide a flexible design choice for decision-makers. Different scales of CBCTA problems are conducted to illustrate the value of the proposed methodology. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology is effective and feasible.},

  abstract={Dyslexia includes a large variety of literacy-related difficulties which demands, in most cases, a personalised intervention. However, as dyslexia affects a large fraction of the population, schools cannot provide individual care for each student. The iLearnRW game provides a tool for students to work on their literacy skills following a personalised teaching programme. The design of the game and adaptation mechanisms integrated with it are aimed at maintaining student engagement for the duration of an open-ended number of playing sessions, while using a limited quantity of assets and literacy content. By focusing on maintenance of engagement, we hope to improve learning outcomes and motivate students to also play the game outside of school.},

  volume={14},
  number={3},
  pages={367-385},
  abstract={Collaboration is one of the important 21st-century skills. It can take place in remote or co-located settings. Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very complex process that involves subtle human interactions that can be described with indicators like eye gaze, speaking time, pitch, and social skills from different modalities. With the advent of sensors, multimodal learning analytics has gained momentum to detect CC quality. Indicators (or low-level events) can be used to detect CC quality with the help of measurable markers (i.e., indexes composed of one or more indicators) which give the high-level collaboration process definition. However, this understanding is incomplete without considering the scenarios (such as problem solving or meetings) of CC. The scenario of CC affects the set of indicators considered: For instance, in collaborative programming, grabbing the mouse from the partner is an indicator of collaboration; whereas in collaborative meetings, eye gaze, and audio level are indicators of collaboration. This can be a result of the differing goals and fundamental parameters (such as group behavior, interaction, or composition) in each scenario. In this article, we present our work on profiles of indicators on the basis of a scenario-driven prioritization, the parameters in different CC scenarios are mapped onto the indicators and the available indexes. This defines the conceptual model to support the design of a CC quality detection and prediction system.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous technologies such as mobile software applications (mobile apps) have a tremendous influence on the evolution of the social, cultural, economic, and political facets of life in society. Mobile apps fulfil many practical purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial management, etc. Given the ubiquity of mobile apps in the lives of individuals and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to consider the relationship between human values and the development and deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values requirements.},

The findings indicate that colleagues play a significant role in information seeking activities, but there is need for better methods of capturing and retaining information from them during development. Also, in terms of online information sources, there is need for more centralization, improved access and organization of resources, and more consistency among formats. More broadly, the findings illustrate a variety of information problems that end-user biologists and professional software developers face in developing bioinformatics software and how they are influenced by the level of domain knowledge and technical expertise.},

The emerging crowdsourcing paradigm is based on harnessing human intelligence, effort and rational behaviors to augment computation and analysis. In addition to the crowdsourcing paradigm, new techniques have emerged that incorporate machine and human computational resources together forming a hybrid intelligence when addressing complex problems and tasks. This combined technique is particularly impactful if human and machine contributions can scale automatically in response to their respective efficiency and effectiveness when addressing subsets of a bigger problem - an approach that we have named mixed elastic systems. In this survey, we highlight state-of-the-art projects that investigate crowdsourcing, hybrid intelligence systems and mixed elastic systems. We also present a taxonomy and classification of the broader domain of human-enhanced computing systems as it assimilates crowdsourcing, hybrid intelligence, and mixed elastic systems.},

Health area has been benefited from the advent of Virtual Reality (VR) especially in education area, where these systems present some advantages over traditional teaching methods such as: cost reduction for training, reducing the use of guinea pigs and anatomical specimens in laboratory practices as well the use of interactive teaching approaches. Another VR's feature is the ability to monitor user's actions for assessing training performance. Thus, statistical models are used in order to check whether a group performed the procedure correctly or not. The goal is to allow the formation of teams and the development of individual skills to work together.

  year={2016},
  volume={10},

  pages={952-961},
  abstract={Persons who have lost their larynx and thus speech functionality need to use a substitution voice to regain speech. The electro-larynx (EL) is a widely used device but is known for its unnatural and monotonic speech quality. Previous research has addressed these problems, but until now no significant improvements could be reported. Moreover, the importance of human-centered computing and co-adaptation was only considered marginally. The EL speech system is a complex system including hardware (artificial excitation source or sound transducer), software (control and generation of the artificial excitation signal) and most important of all, the human user. Taking one isolated problem into consideration is not an adequate approach here, since all aspects of the EL speech system need to be integrated into a holistic approach. We have responded by pushing forward the boundaries of the conventional EL device toward a new bionic electro-larynx speech system. In this paper, we review existing approaches and summarize the most important findings. Subsequently, we piece together an overall speech system, which integrates several parts to significantly improve EL speech: we study electromyographic signals to analyze their suitability for hands-free on/off control of the EL speech system and investigate learning effects in the training of naive users. We propose a new transducer for the EL speech system based on electromagnetic mechanisms. The technical properties of the new transducer show significant advantages over the conventional electro-dynamic transducer. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to estimate a changing fundamental frequency from the speech spectral envelope and an optimized waveform shape for the excitation signal. Listening tests show that a changing fundamental frequency improves the perceived naturalness of EL speech. Listening tests serve as a proof of concept for the resulting EL speech system, which confirm that the proposed system is very promising.},

  abstract={Experts in data and physical sciences have to regularly grapple with the problem of competing models. Be it analytical or physics-based models, a cross-cutting challenge for experts is to reliably diagnose which model outcomes appropriately predict or simulate real-world phenomena. Expert judgment involves reconciling information across many, and often, conflicting criteria that describe the quality of model outcomes. In this paper, through a design study with climate scientists, we develop a deeper understanding of the problem and solution space of model diagnostics, resulting in the following contributions: i) a problem and task characterization using which we map experts' model diagnostics goals to multi-way visual comparison tasks, ii) a design space of comparative visual cues for letting experts quickly understand the degree of disagreement among competing models and gauge the degree of stability of model outputs with respect to alternative criteria, and iii) design and evaluation of MyriadCues, an interactive visualization interface for exploring alternative hypotheses and insights about good and bad models by leveraging comparative visual cues. We present case studies and subjective feedback by experts, which validate how MyriadCues enables more transparent model diagnostic mechanisms, as compared to the state of the art.},

  abstract={Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of heart and vasculature conditions which are the leading form of mortality worldwide. Blood vessels can become narrowed, restricting blood flow, and drive the majority of hearts attacks and strokes. Reactive surgical interventions are frequently required; including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Despite successful opening of vessels and restoration of blood flow, often in-stent restenosis (ISR) and graft failure can still occur, resulting in subsequent patient morbidity and mortality. A new generation of cardiovascular implants that have sensors and real-time monitoring capabilities are being developed to combat ISR and graft failure. Self-reporting stent/graft technology could enable precision medicine-based and predictive healthcare by detecting the earliest features of disease, even before symptoms occur. Bringing an implantable medical device with wireless electronic sensing capabilities to market is complex and often obstructive undertaking. This critical review analyses the obstacles that need to be overcome for self-reporting stents/grafts to be developed and provide a precision-medicine based healthcare for cardiovascular patients. Here we assess the latest research and technological advancement in the field, the current devices; including smart cardiovascular implantable biosensors and associated wireless data and power transfer solutions. We include an evaluation of devices that have reached clinical trials and the market potential for their end-user implementation.},

  abstract={With new technologies such as body sensors, tangible interaction, haptics, interactive cloth, or small computing devices such as mobiles, we can move interaction from the desktop out into the world and onto our bodies. Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for non-instrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI. We suggest that learning technologies could use some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experience to happen, but in the end, it is the user who co-constructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving dasiasurfacespsila open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognise themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism.},

  title={Cybersecurity Challenges for Manufacturing Systems 4.0: Assessment of the Business Impact Level},
  year={2023},
  volume={70},
  number={11},
  pages={3745-3765},
  abstract={An ever-growing number of companies are moving toward the Industry 4.0 paradigm, adopting a range of advanced technologies (e.g., smart sensors, big data analytics, and cloud computing) and networking their manufacturing systems. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of operations but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments. In particular, based on this study, companies can define the critical manufacturing data to protect against cyber-attacks, isolate the business impacts in case of cybersecurity breaches, correlate the identified business impacts with the specific data category, and assess the level of business impacts.},

  title={How Can Human Values be Addressed in Agile Methods? A Case Study on SAFe},
  year={2022},
  volume={48},
  number={12},
  pages={5158-5175},
  abstract={Agile methods are predominantly focused on delivering business values. But can Agile methods be adapted to effectively address and deliver human values such as social justice, privacy, and sustainability in the software they produce? Human values are what an individual or a society considers important in life. Ignoring these human values in software can pose difficulties or risks for all stakeholders (e.g., user dissatisfaction, reputation damage, financial loss). To answer this question, we selected the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), one of the most commonly used Agile methods in the industry, and conducted a qualitative case study to identify possible intervention points within SAFe that are the most natural to address and integrate human values in software. We present five high-level empirically-justified sets of interventions in SAFe: artefacts, roles, ceremonies, practices, and culture. We elaborate how some current Agile artefacts (e.g., user story), roles (e.g., product owner), ceremonies (e.g., stand-up meeting), and practices (e.g., business-facing testing) in SAFe can be modified to support the inclusion of human values in software. Further, our study suggests new and exclusive values-based artefacts (e.g., legislative requirement), ceremonies (e.g., values conversation), roles (e.g., values champion), and cultural practices (e.g., induction and hiring) to be introduced in SAFe for this purpose. Guided by our findings, we argue that existing Agile methods can account for human values in software delivery with some evolutionary adaptations.},

  abstract={Current research has shown that global software development (GSD) organizations rely on agile methods to guarantee better communication, coordination, and improved productivity. Moreover, as organizations continue to grow, they are facing large-scale global project challenges and complexity, leading to an urge to scale agile practices for better coordination. However, it has been surprising to find that approaches in the literature on scaling agile for large and global projects remain unclear. In addition, to identify and highlight which agile scales practices reported in studies on Agile GSD (AGSD) are related to SAFe practices, we conducted a systematic literature review. Besides, we mapped AGSD practices to the SAFe 5.0 framework to provide bases for those starting on such a journey. In our study, we found 24 articles related to the scaling of agile practices in a global environment, and 44 scaling agile practices that embrace 95 SAFe 5.0 components, including “agile coaching,” “agile architecture,” and “system demo”. This study provides an in-depth scientific investigation on how SAFe can be associated with global teams applying GSD. The results and findings will benefit researchers and practitioners in conducting further research and provide more dedicated solutions for challenges to scaling agile in the context of GSD.},

  abstract={In the context of distance learning and teaching, a reengineering process needs a feedback on the learners' uses of the learning system.

Our works on the reengineering driven by models of e-learning systems, propose an architecture for usage analysis and a meta-language for describing the tracks' semantic and for linking them to observation needs defined in the predictive scenario. This architecture wants to be a collaborative cluster of services available for and designed by a community of practices on usage analysis. Concerning our meta-language UTL, we consider that it is important to interpret tracks in order to compare the designer's intentions with the learners' activities during a session.},

  abstract={Health-related online communities are increasingly popular platforms on which consumers engage in peer-to-peer communication while seeking and providing health-related information. These platforms provide an empirical account of user communications related to health behaviors. Several advanced analytical approaches have been developed to unearth and characterize social influence mechanisms embedded in these platforms. However, translating these insights into design features of consumer-facing health promotion information systems presents very significant challenges. In this paper, we present a design methodology that utilizes persuasive principles and lessons learned from large-scale analysis of an online community for smoking cessation, to harness social influence and implement as technological features of a behavior support intervention. We transformed observed social diffusion patterns underlying user communication events to user-participatory interactions that can potentially lead to superior user engagement through meaningful network affiliations and thence to sustained healthy behavior change. Preliminary evaluation study and future steps are discussed.},

  number={5},
  pages={1265-1308},
  abstract={Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a powerful multiple access, interference management, and multi-user strategy for next generation communication systems. In this tutorial, we depart from the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) versus non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) discussion held in 5G, and the conventional multi-user linear precoding approach used in space-division multiple access (SDMA), multi-user and massive MIMO in 4G and 5G, and show how multi-user communications and multiple access design for 6G and beyond should be intimately related to the fundamental problem of interference management. We start from foundational principles of interference management and rate-splitting, and progressively delineate RSMA frameworks for downlink, uplink, and multi-cell networks. We show that, in contrast to past generations of multiple access techniques (OMA, NOMA, SDMA), RSMA offers numerous benefits: 1) enhanced spectral, energy and computation efficiency; 2) universality by unifying and generalizing OMA, SDMA, NOMA, physical-layer multicasting, multi-user MIMO under a single framework that holds for any number of antennas at each node (SISO, SIMO, MISO, and MIMO settings); 3) flexibility by coping with any interference levels (from very weak to very strong), network loads (underloaded, overloaded), services (unicast, multicast), traffic, user deployments (channel directions and strengths); 4) robustness to inaccurate channel state information (CSI) and resilience to mixed-critical quality of service; 5) reliability under short channel codes and low latency. We then discuss how those benefits translate into numerous opportunities for RSMA in over forty different applications and scenarios of 6G, e.g., multi-user MIMO with statistical/quantized CSI, FDD/TDD/cell-free massive MIMO, millimeter wave and terahertz, cooperative relaying, physical layer security, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, cloud-radio access network, internet-of-things, massive access, joint communication and jamming, non-orthogonal unicast and multicast, multigroup multicast, multibeam satellite, space-air-ground integrated networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, integrated sensing and communications, grant-free access, network slicing, cognitive radio, optical/visible light communications, mobile edge computing, machine/federated learning, etc. We finally address common myths and answer frequently asked questions, opening the discussions to interesting future research avenues. Supported by the numerous benefits and applications, the tutorial concludes on the underpinning role played by RSMA in next generation networks, which should inspire future research, development, and standardization of RSMA-aided communication for 6G.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is the latest trend in business for providing software, platforms and services over the Internet. However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.},

  abstract={The locus of innovation has shifted from mechanical advances to digital solutions. By emphasizing the importance of user needs, Design Thinking is apt to develop human-centered innovation, including digital solutions. Using two representative examples from 21 Design Thinking projects spanning the gamut of mechatronic to fully digital solutions, we report on critical incidents as opportunities and challenges of applying Design Thinking in a digital context. In the case of mechatronic solutions, we identified opportunities related to improved collaboration and higher quality prototyping as well as in innovative business models, which in turn created challenges in managing stakeholders. In the fully digital context, we observed opportunities in improved needfinding and the ability to offer individualized products. Conversely, we uncover difficulties in imagining digital features, estimating their feasibility, and correctly setting the fidelity of prototypes. Based on these observations, we discuss the intangibility of digital artifacts as enabler and inhibitor of Design Thinking in a digital context.},

  abstract={Computational Politics is the study of computational methods to analyze and moderate users' behaviors related to political activities such as election campaign persuasion, political affiliation, and opinion mining. With the rapid development and ease of access to the Internet, Information Communication Technologies (ICT) have given rise to massive numbers of users joining online communities and the digitization of political practices such as debates. These communities and digitized data contain both explicit and latent information about users and their behaviors related to politics and social movements. For researchers, it is essential to utilize data from these sources to develop and design systems that not only provide solutions to computational politics but also help other businesses, such as marketers, to increase users' participation and interactions. In this survey, we attempt to categorize main areas in computational politics and summarize the prominent studies in one place to better understand computational politics across different and multidimensional platforms. e.g., online social networks, online forums, and political debates. We then conclude this study by highlighting future research directions, opportunities, and challenges.},

Overall, this provides a fuller picture to how older adults use and experience social robots in their homes. Our work involves a robot hosting period for at least a month (up to 12 months) in older adults' homes with an experience debrief session held a month into the robot hosting time period. We propose reflections on the novelty effect with respect to older adults' usage data and highlight feelings of guilt, the robot's proactivity and movement, meeting (or not meeting) user expectations, and the robot's persona as key aspects of the hosting experience that promoted usage or non-usage. Finally, we provide design guidelines for structuring future mixed-method long-term robot usage studies being mindful of ethical considerations in this space.},

Firstly, a new method for task granularity quantitative analysis is put forward, which can precisely evaluate the task granularity of complex product cooperation workflow in the integrated manufacturing system, on the above basis; this method is used to guide the coarse-grained task decomposition and recombine the subtasks with low cohesion coefficient. Then, a multi-objective optimieation model and an algorithm are set up for the scheduling optimization of task scheduling. Finally, the application feasibility of the model and algorithm is ultimately validated through an application case study.},

  abstract={The emergence of intelligent economy is a subversive change in human society. The current field of education has gradually become a practical field of real-time interaction and integration between virtuality and reality. Digital Twin has the characteristics of virtual and real symbiosis, high virtual simulation, high real-time interaction and deep insight, etc., and its application trend also extends from the industrial field to the field of education. With the revolutionary upgrade of computing efficiency, connection and display technology, the integration of digital world and physical world has been promoted, and the holographic classroom with the morphological characteristics of "visual 3D learning space" has been jointly created. In this paper, the characteristics of digital twin technology are analyzed, and the characteristics and application forms of holographic classroom are discussed. Finally, the application prospect of holographic classroom is given, which is mainly reflected in: sublimating learning space, optimizing distance learning process, helping maker and innovation education, boosting vocational education, promoting scientific management and control of teaching facilities, and improving the level of dynamic evaluation of teaching.

  abstract={A perennially interesting research topic in the field of visual analytics is how to effectively develop systems that support organizational users' decision-making and reasoning processes. The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems. We validate the soundness of our framework with two visual analytics systems, namely Entity Workspace [8] and PatViz [37].},

  abstract={Recognizing activities has become increasingly relevant in many application domains, such as security or ambient assisted living. To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, the market size of connected wellness devices has grown in an exponential fashion. This trend is due to the advent and affordability of connected wearables and activity trackers. While users see in these health and wellness devices opportunities to nurture a culture of health and wellbeing, several hurdles still exist towards developing this culture. Wearable technologies companies have built closed-gated ecosystems around their products, preventing them to resonate with the clinical guidelines and best practices. Thus, users of these wearables find themselves torn apart between two drastically different environments; The medical healthcare environment and the wellness environment. In this paper, we explore the efforts already done to bridge that gap by analyzing the available health solutions. From this analysis, we draft guidelines for an integrated health and wellness ecosystem. These proposed guidelines focus on the Human-IoT Interaction aspect as an important cornerstone in the success and sustainability of the health and wellness program. These guidelines will also account for scalability and compatibility depending respectively on the advancement of medical practices and technologies available.},

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology for building a consensus among the stakeholders based on the level of importance of each evaluation criterion to choose the best final design, approach, or solution for a project. The proposed methodology adopts an improved vague set minimum-cost consensus model (MCCM) and a modified Delphi method. This paper discusses several shortcomings of the traditional MCCM and the Delphi method. It argues that humans' resistance to change based on a numerical rating scale follows a natural logarithm pattern instead of a linear or quadratic pattern as claimed in other studies. Hence, the traditional MCCM needs to be revised accordingly. In addition, an experiment was concluded to compare the proposed consensus-building methodology with the traditional Delphi method. The experiment showed that the proposed methodology is better than the traditional Delphi method regarding using fewer rounds to reach a consensus. At last, this paper applies the proposed methodology to the field of road junction design selection.},

  abstract={For companies, knowledge is the central and decisive resource for success. Today, however, knowledge must flow more than ever before in order to meet the requirements of shorter innovation cycles and an increasingly agile working environment. The distribution and generation of knowledge requires a digital workplace environment that facilitates communication and collaboration between employees and their environment. The digital workplace acts as both a technical enabler and an attractive feature, thus making a major contribution to organizational performance and recruiting, retaining and motivating staff. Such an infrastructure, which connects users, makes them capable of working ubiquitously. Due to the complexity and ambiguities of such an endeavour it can only be rolled out and developed on an ongoing basis in close interaction with users. Therefore, this contribution proposes an agile framework for large-scale end-user participation in developing digital workplace environments based on an agile design approach that actively and continuously involves employees.},

  abstract={The article deals with the problems of emotional infection of the stakeholders of the innovation SMART Government project in a crisis. In the process of managing innovative projects, managers try to model creative behaviour and are based on creative technologies. Emotional infection is considered as a social and psychological mechanism of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the innovative project, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect the effectiveness of management. The main object of creative technology is the manager or group, and the task was to educate, educate and create the organization of new behaviour in adverse, deadly and aggressive external conditions. In times of crisis, the emotional behaviour of the project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model for managing innovative projects. Examples of changes in the competence of the manager and the project team in the case of a wall and asthenic emotions are given.},

  abstract={Federated satellite systems (FSS) consist of heterogeneous spacecraft with opportunistic data services. FSS membership is based on voluntary participation by independent actors without the centralized control required for systems engineering methods. New approaches must be developed to identify and assess mechanisms and incentives for collaborative behaviors required in a FSS. Towards this goal, this paper develops an interactive tabletop board game to demonstrate a technical simulation model integrated inside a social decision-making activity. Although simplified in technical detail, the game achieves a level of realism by basing its structure and behavior on a logical model of FSS with hierarchical federation, federate, system, and subsystem constructs. A prototype game provides a physical form using a game board, mats, tokens, counters, and cards to represent key constructs. Play-testing sessions reveal insights regarding FSS including participation based on minimizing opportunity cost, legacy hardware as a barrier to participation, partnerships to overcome the initial actor problem, and frequent under-estimation of network complexity and robustness.},

We present a large display interactive multivariate visual approach, aimed towards supporting clinicians during the transition of care. We first provide a characterization of the problem domain in terms of data and tasks, based on an observation session at the University of Illinois Hospital, and on interviews with several biomedical researchers and ICU clinicians. Informed by this experience, we design a scalable, interactive visual approach that supports both overview and detail views of ICU patient data, as well as anomaly detection, comparison, and annotation of the data. We demonstrate a large-display implementation of the visualization on an existing anonymized ICU dataset. Feedback from domain experts indicates this approach successfully meets the requirements of effective care transitions.},

  abstract={The use of social media has become pervasive across many aspects of our lives. We now depend on social media platforms more than ever before. Our dependence on social media has created a greater demand for a higher quality of service, but also for this quality to apply in new areas. As the social media experience and “real world” experience merge, there is an increased expectation that the norms of society will also apply in social media settings. There is an increasing demand for social media platforms to empower users with tools to report hate speech and other forms of dangerous content. There is also an increasing demand for greater quality of service in the way these reports are managed. The approach of social media companies to this problem, which is to largely avoid the issue by not publishing the data needed to assess the relevant quality of service, is being overcome by third party solutions. This paper discusses one such solution which is currently under development, as well as some of the challenges to improving quality of service in this area.},

  abstract={The users of the World Wide Web produce data continuously. This happens in varied areas such as trading on line, product ratings, support and use of services, and many more, comprising Distance Education. The ever increasing amount of such data can make analysis and extraction of meaningful information progressively harder, and sophisticated analysis techniques are to be used to extract added value from data. Many companies do collection and analysis of data with the purpose to develop their marketing strategies. In the field of education, and Distance Education in particular, data collected through online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can provide a great resource, and a strong challenge, for the analysis of learning processes, the design of training paths, and the updating and personalization of learning environments. While, on the one hand, there is an increasing demand by educational institutions to measure, demonstrate, and improve the results achieved in distance learning, on the other hand the logic of traditional reporting included in LMS platforms does not satisfy that growing need. Learning Analytics is the answer to the need for optimization of learning through the techniques of analysis of data produced by learning processes, involving all stakeholders of the system. In this paper we show and discuss a brief state of the art of models of Learning Analytics presented in the literature.},

  abstract={Prioritizing requirements is a crucial ingredient of successful Requirements Engineering (RE). The popular prioritization techniques assume that stakeholders are known and can be mandated to contribute to the prioritization process. This prerequisite no longer holds for many of today's systems where significant stakeholders (end-users, in particular) are outside organizational reach: they are neither known nor can they be identified among the members of the involved organizations. Classic techniques for involving these stakeholders such as polls or questionnaires are neither interactive nor collaborative, which is detrimental for prioritization. Social media enable collaborative prioritization, but fall short in motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to participate voluntarily. In this light, we are developing the Garuso platform, which combines social media with gamification for motivating stakeholders. While first approaches to employing gamification in RE are promising, research is still in its infancy. Especially, little is known about the influence of the gamification algorithms controlling single game elements on the stakeholders' activities. In this paper we report on a field experiment in which we investigated this influence with Garuso. We found statistically significant differences between different algorithms controlling single game elements on the contributions of stakeholders to the prioritization of requirements.},

  abstract={Prioritization of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and renewal interventions is a key issue for policy making at the urban level. This paper aims at involving citizens in the urban degradation survey process, in order to support strategic decisions of the public administration, through a streamlined process. This contribution belongs to a wider research, aiming at providing a more inclusive approach also in design and use phase of public spaces and assets. Therefore, it has been developed a web-based decision making platform fostering community participation, conceived as a modular system involving both technical surveys on physical urban degradation and perceived urban degradation assessment provided by citizens. The scope of the research concerns the involvement of citizens in urban O&M and regeneration prioritization, through advanced IT tools. The methodology exploits the functionalities of web-based survey tools feeding a digital district model: a modular information system employed as the participation platform among different stakeholders involved in the prioritization of operations in the urban environment. Data are stored and managed thanks to a Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) jointly with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Outputs are thematic maps, used by the public administration to make strategic decisions on how to invest for improvement of urban deficiencies. In this paper is presented the possibility to integrate the technical survey module, with the community involvement module. In conclusion can be stated that, the proposed methodology is a useful framework for implementation of strategies for improvement of urban quality, involving citizens' participation. Moreover, partially automates andfosters the selection of most relevant precincts where to implement interventions.},

  abstract={Massive connectivity of billions of communicating devices for fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks requires the deployment of self-sustaining, maintenance-free, and low-cost communication paradigms. Could passive Internet of Things (IoT) solve these challenges? Passive IoT can be realized with the backscatter communication (BackCom) paradigm, which uses ultra-low power, inexpensive passive tags to support massive connectivity. However, a comprehensive link budget analysis for BackCom networks has not yet been available. It is something that is necessary for practitioners and researchers to evaluate the potential of BackCom. This survey is organized as follows. First, we describe the BackCom configurations, passive IoT design targets, backscatter channel statistics, and the different components and operations of the backscatter tag. Second, we develop the forward link budget and the overall link budget. All the relevant parameters are described in detail. Third, we give numerical and simulation results to get insights on the achievable performance of BackCom networks. Since additive path losses and excess fading can limit the performance of BackCom networks, we examine potential solutions to overcome the resulting limitations, enabling massive IoT networks. We also discuss integrating BackCom with existing wireless technologies. We further highlight some applications and address open issues, challenges, and future research directions.},

In radiotherapy for head and neck cancer treatment, dosage to organs at risk surrounding a tumor is a large cause of treatment toxicity. Along with the availability of patient repositories, this situation has lead to clinician interest in understanding and predicting RT outcomes based on previously treated similar patients. To enable this type of analysis, we introduce a novel topology-based spatial similarity measure, T-SSIM, and a predictive algorithm based on this similarity measure. We couple the algorithm with a visual steering interface that intertwines visual encodings for the spatial data and statistical results, including a novel parallel-marker encoding that is spatially aware. We report quantitative results on a cohort of 165 patients, as well as a qualitative evaluation with domain experts in radiation oncology, data management, biostatistics, and medical imaging, who are collaborating remotely.},

  pages={3118-3129},
  abstract={Edge computing can provide high bandwidth and low-latency service for big data tasks by leveraging the edge side’s computing, storage, and network resources. With the development of microservice and docker technology, service providers can flexibly and dynamically cache microservice at the edge side to respond efficiently with limited resources. Automatically caching needed services on the nearest edge nodes and dynamically scheduling users’ requests can realize that computing power and software services flow with the users to provide continuous services. However, achieving the goal needs to overcome many challenges, such as the significant fluctuation of user devices’ requests at the edge side and the lack of collaboration among edge nodes. In this article, dynamic computing power scheduling and collaborative task scheduling among edge nodes are comprehensively developed. The problem is considered a multiobjective optimization problem, including sequentially minimizing the deadline missing rate of requests and the average task completion time. We propose an adaptive mechanism for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) in the edge environment to solve this problem. It adopts the greedy decision method to schedule computing tasks to meet their deadline requirements. At the same time, it uses the best-fit method to adjust the computing resources according to the changes of users’ requests. The simulation results show that ADCS can decrease the deadline missing rate and reduce the average completion time. Compared with DSR and CoDSR, the deadline missing rate is reduced by 59.91% and 19.95%, respectively. The average completion time is decreased by 37.87% and 6.71%.},

  abstract={Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99 research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples’ experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Most papers focused on usability/theory-based or wider system experience research with a focus on Wizard of Oz and developed systems Questionnaires on usability and user attitudes often used but few were reliable or validated Thematic analysis showed nine primary research topics Challenges identified in theoretical approaches and design guidelines, engaging with technological advances, multiple user and in the wild contexts, critical research mass and barriers to building speech interfaces},

  abstract={Information Technology (IT) has become the backbone of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) since it is crucial to their everyday activities and development. Such dependency on IT also provides certain risks [1], therefore there is a need for Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) and Information System security implementation. Many frameworks, including one of the most popular - COBIT, provides the structure and the best practice for such implementation. EGIT implementation often requires plenty of IT resources which SME lack, thus some recommendations and guidance are needed. The research is addressing the lack of support for the information security implementation of the COBIT framework in Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).},

  abstract={The issues related to the development of cloud technologies are considered, in particular, the development and implementation of distributed information systems, which today are the most important decision in the market of information technologies. The reasons for the negative conclusion of most such projects are analyzed, the conclusion is made on the necessity of applying to these processes the technologies of project management that are sufficiently developed and effective at this time. The main tasks of the research and scientific novelty are: the classification of the impacts of the environment of projects, the construction of a conceptual model of information interaction on the basis of impacts, construction and research of a mathematical model for taking into account the impacts on the results of the creation of infocommunication systems. To determine the types of impacts on the system (projects) and determine its reaction, the authors proposed a conceptual model cube of interaction processes This made it possible to apply a method for forecasting the state of projects by the impact of changes based on the effects of the project environment, both internal and external. The analysis is carried out to study the parameters and characteristics of projects for the creation of complex infocommunication products and the main causes of project failures based on the generated classes of influences are identified. A list of top-level dynamic changes has been generated that made it possible to determine the main impacts on all components and participants of project activities.},

  abstract={In this paper, an innovative cyber-human based assessment approach developed for a VR based orthopedic surgical training simulator is presented. The approach is based on three perspectives: knowledge assessment, skills assessment and an assessment of mental composure. Such an approach provides a foundation for a robust and balanced assessment of the Virtual Reality (VR)/ Augmented Reality (AR) simulation environment on improving the knowledge and skills of the users involved in the simulation based training. A discussion of the three assessment methods is provided followed by the assessment studies conducted at a medical hospital. The major outcomes of the assessment activities are discussed in the paper which underline the usefulness of such an integrated assessment approach.},

  abstract={To make responsible products and e-services with people and not only with specialists, a new eco-citizen vision of innovation is necessary, called e-co-innovation. In Reunion Island, we have introduced Semiotic Web as a human-centered method to manage sustainable development with ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). The signification or semiosis is the key psychological process that gives sense to e-co-innovation for making ICT usage-based research, rather than technology-based. The scene develops itself in partnership with end-users to exchange data, information and knowledge. In this sharing frame, the Living Labs (LL) concept allows to emphasize the importance on political and methodological principles to practice open innovation guided by usages. On more pragmatic, scientific and technical plans, we have set up a conceptual method for making products/services based on Sign management, and a tool called the Creativity or Co-design platform, used to build iteratively e-services with pilot users (lead-users). These resources have been applied for ten years at University of Reunion Island (UR) to help to manage tropical biodiversity (coral reefs and forests) and develop instrumental e-learning in music (guitar and piano) in order to satisfy the desires of target users in the domain of education by Teaching and Learning (TL).},

Current solutions do not provide support for analyzing vast amounts of data. Also, implementation of cloud architectures proved inappropriate for real-time or near real-time processing and control because of the network latency. Under these considerations, the new paradigm of fog computing provides promising characteristics enabling greater scalability, fast reaction time and increasing security through a local private processing cloud structure. This paper evaluates the integration capabilities between existing technologies with new devices for seamless integration of the fog computing paradigm and provides an architecture solution for this upgrade.},

  abstract={Coordination between different parts of a design is a difficult task, especially if the design is made by several designers geographically distributed and using different modeling tools. Traditionally, this is done through physical meetings between representatives of the various design groups. However, it faces difficulties when it comes to large and complex problems of design. In this study, a new approach for efficient optimization based on multi-agent paradigm is proposed to facilitate the collaborative distributed design through coordination, information exchange and negotiation. The proposed method is applied to the pre-design case of an electric vehicle to demonstrate its validity and effectiveness.},

  abstract={Lifecycle and effective dada management has become and still remains a difficult task in architecture, engineering, and construction domain. Recently, the emerging Building Information Modeling (BIM) gains more and more momentum in construction data presenting, processing, and sharing. With precise 3D digital geometry graphs, BIM has the potential to integrate diverse data from construction phases (design, construction, maintenance) and therefore becomes a promising collaboration platform for involved personnel. High efficiency BIM model processing is one of the critical issues for construction industry to truly embrace BIM technology. However, this topic has been rarely studied compared with other issues in BIM research. This paper presents an augmented version of MapReduce (MR), the popular distributed parallel computing model, to solve this problem. The main contribution lies in two points: 1) BIM models are extracted into uneven partitions according to construction domain features, followed by a specifically designed pre-process mechanism, which solves the unsuitability of classical MR's even blocking in construction domain and further greatly improves performance; 2) process and thread level parallel computing techniques are introduced into MR in single node to form a two-tier hybrid parallel architecture, which is more adaptive to BIM's massive graphical data processing. The proposed framework has been successfully used in real business applications of project quantity computation and BIM model collision detection. Experiment result from lab environment proves its efficiency and usability.},

  abstract={Increasing popularity in the use of crowd sourcing has led to many tasks that can be fulfilled by the wisdom of human actors. When natural disasters or criminal activities occur, then sometimes crowd sourced tasks must be generated in real-time and must be fulfilled in an on-demand fashion. Effective use of crowd sourcing techniques requires an array of services that fulfil many dimensions of the overall problem such as resource selection and allocation, solution selection, and compensation. Any architecture that can provide these services in real-time, on demand requires a dynamic configurable infrastructure. This paper describes an adaptive framework for on-demand crowd sourced tasks supported by a design pattern-inspired architecture.},

  abstract={In the context of Digital Transformation, organizations need to react in a flexible manner to rapidly changing markets and disruptive technologies. Customer and user satisfaction are important in order to succeed. Agile User Experience (UX) Design and Lean User Research enable the organization to focus on the needs of its customers and users. The objective of this paper is to investigate the best practices that exist for user research in agile product development. In particular, we want to answer the following question: What impact does Lean User Research have and how is it conducted in industry? We have carried out several studies to answer our questions. First, we created the pattern Lean User Research by means of a systematic pattern mining process. Next, we gathered quantitative data by means of a questionnaire study. This was followed by the collection of qualitative data in a panel discussion with experts from academia and industry. The results reveal that Agile has an impact on how user research is conducted because of the speed of agile product development. In addition, we provide best practices of Lean User Research and show how they are applied in industry by giving practical examples. Moreover, we found that the UX community values the aspects of Lean User Research as important, but do not constantly apply it in their practical work. We can conclude that people have to experiment and adapt the best practices of Lean User Research to their special contexts as well as develop an agile mindset.},

  abstract={Sustainable development is crucial to securing the future of humanity. Blockchain as a disruptive technology and a driver for social change has exhibited great potential to promote sustainable practices and help organizations and governments achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Existing literature reviews on blockchain and sustainability often focus only on topics related to a few SDGs. There is a need to consolidate existing results in terms of SDGs and provide a comprehensive overview of the impacts that blockchain technology may have on each SDG. This paper intends to bridge this gap, presenting a tertiary review based on 42 literature reviews, to investigate the relationship between blockchain and sustainability in light of SDGs. The method used is a consensus-based expert elicitation with thematic analysis. The findings include a novel and comprehensive mapping of impact-based interlinkage of blockchain and SDGs and a systematic overview of drivers and barriers to adopting blockchain for sustainability. The findings reveal that blockchain can have a positive impact on all 17 SDGs though some negative effects can occur and impede the achievement of certain objectives. 76 positive and 10 negative linkages between blockchain adoption and the 17 SDGs as well as 45 factors that drive or hinder blockchain adoption for the achievement of SDGs have been identified. Research gaps to overcome the barriers and enhance blockchain’s positive impacts have also been identified. The findings may help managers in evaluating the applicability and tradeoffs, and policymakers in making supportive measures to facilitate sustainability using blockchain.},

  abstract={Research focused on values in information systems (IS) is conducted using a diversity of approaches, methods and theoretical frameworks. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the relationship between values and materiality -- specifically, how researchers materialize values -- in IS research. Analysis of the literature demonstrates that IS researchers perceive the values of research subjects in their language, attitudes, design, and practices. They also materialize values at different temporal points in the research process. These materialization choices are largely independent of research method, and are an important research design consideration. Conceptualizing the materiality of values can enable values researchers to be explicit about methodological choices regarding the observation of values.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of new and improved sensors for military and civilian vehicles, the challenges for integrating the sensors, retrieving and processing data from them have become more complex. Typically, these sensors come with APIs as specified by the manufacturer and hence integrating newer sensors on the existing and newer platforms as well as interoperability with other platform sub-systems is highly taxing. Also, these sensors open the realm of possibilities for further automation of vehicles. Types and levels of automation are a big challenge as to how much automation is possible and should be allowed, and how to effectively use the sensors for automation and informing the vehicle crew. The NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) proposes an open architecture approach to land vehicle platform design and integration and standardises the interfaces and protocols for military vehicle systems integration. However, the NGVA does not specify any feedback mechanisms exploiting the available sensor data to support the vehicle crew. In this paper, we present a simple crew assistance system which integrates NGVA-compliant sensors and includes an adaptable rule-based interface for sensor data processing. This crew assistance system takes into consideration human factors such as human cognitive and physical workload and informs the crew members about ongoing critical events derived from available sensor data using visual, audio and haptic feedbacks in the form of alarms to increase their Situational Awareness by raising alarms on detection of specific events and making intelligent future predictions.},

We are particularly interested in the convergence of people and computational processes (agents) in the creation of digital communities for sustainabilityand successful collective action. However, prior experience with intelligent and adaptive user interfaces suggests that the symbiosisof people and technology needs to be carefully considered. This paper presents three applications of self-organising socio-technicalsystems, from which we derive design guidelines for implementing interactive self-governance. The guidelines are related to the methodology of value-sensitive design and the need to actualise human values as acritical supra-functional requirement of future socio-technical systems.},

  abstract={Today more, more Web services are exposed to developers through public APIs (API-fication), enabling the spread of new services which create value for end users. The number of these services is expected to grow in the coming years. This will complicate the user experience due to the complexity required to figure out which of the available services are the most relevant and, also, the need for a user to install a different application (or to browse a specific Web page) for each service of interest. In this article, we introduce a method to determine in real-time the context of a user by leveraging on information gathered from both his personal devices (e.g., his smartphone, tablet and/or smart watch), his social accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). This allows to identify the physical context of the user (position, motion), his logical context (preferences, personal data). We then propose an algorithm which, starting from this contextual information, enables the discovery, the selection of the most appropriate services for a user according to his context. In addition, we have developed a single Android application to dynamically create a graphical user interface for each of the discovered services. This approach improves the user-service interaction providing a common user experience which does not depend on the type of service.},

The framework is based on a game-theoretical approach that optimizes behavior of each IDS sensor with respect to other sensors in highly dynamic environments. We formalize the proposed collaborative architecture as a game between defenders and attackers and transform the hard problem of heterogeneous collaboration into an easier problem of finding two functions that are used in the game-theoretical model to specialize the detection mechanisms on a specific type of malicious activity. The collaboration of such more specialized IDS nodes covers much wider range of attack classes, allowing the collaborating system to maximize the overall network security awareness. We have evaluated the proposed concept on real networks, where we have shown considerable improvements in the detection capabilities of intrusion detection devices thanks to the proposed collaboration model.},

Sketches are used to elicit different application aspects and highlight stakeholder needs. Tool support for sketching activities has increased in recent years, especially in the area of UI prototyping. When quickly developing a first impression of future UIs, designers, engineers, and domain experts use sketches to gain a common understanding of layout and dialog flows. Although multi-touch gestures have gained importance in recent years, tools for sketching gesture-based applications lack support for custom gestures and typically just integrate a basic predefined gesture set. We demonstrate how UIs based on custom gestures can be developed in an augmented team room equipped with wall-sized interactive displays using formal gesture description and recognition techniques integrated in storyboards and UI sketches.},

In this paper, we reviewed features of educational game design and history learning. Then, we discuss the application of pedagogical elements in educational game design. The result is a history game design model and level design for History Multimedia Interactive Educational Game (HMIEG). The model consists of four main elements: interaction, knowledge, engine and level.

  pages={492-497},
  abstract={Optical engines co-packaged with switching Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) can offer a solution for advancement in bandwidth requirement and are potentially the ultimate direction for the long-touted "optical integration" era. This paper proposes a novel signal integrity (SI) design methodology for package of co-packaged optics (CPO) by using channel operating margin (COM) as a figure of merit (FOM) for the first time. The conventional design method of SI based on individual criteria, such as masks for loss, crosstalk, jitter, eye width/height, impedance, etc., are no longer able to be satisfied at the same time for current high-speed signals up to 50Gbps and even over 100Gbps. COM, combining most of the individual criteria into a single value of signal to noise ratio, provides the possibility to estimate the quality of the channel and achieve a balance between performance and design complexity in the early design stage. In this work, a design methodology in a format of a visible map using the most two significant factors, loss, and crosstalk, to satisfy the required COM is discussed in detail. With this novel methodology, one can predict the SI performance of a package in the early design stage when the real layout has not generated yet for full-wave simulation and can avoid the costly iteration in the conventional design concept.},

  abstract={Global energy systems are transforming from fossil fuels to renewables, but the conventional electricity systems are so fragile that could lead to negative consequences such as soaring prices, rolling blackouts, security issues and delays to emission reductions. Confronting to these issues, electricity systems of the future will be vastly changed, dominated by new technologies and business models, increasingly digital and highly complex. Such transformation will be enabled by means to efficiently, stably and affordably distribute electrical power from many sources and storage points. Market design, policy, regulations, legislations, cyber security and politics are barely keeping up with advances in technologies, and energy technology choices have multi-generational implications for people and economies. These issues are global and to find a solution requires true systems thinking, informed by cutting-edge research. This paper envisages interdisciplinary digitalized future energy systems for emission reductions and proposes a 6-theme template to shape the future energy system. The six research themes have been designed such that the “whole is greater than the sum of the parts”. Each theme is informed by the others and the inter-linking of the six themes’ inputs and outputs will drive the outcomes and impacts of future energy systems.},

Moreover, a large amount of time passes from the teacher's feedback and the student's proprioceptive perception while studying, requiring a big effort in developing an efficient and healthy technique. In this paper, we present our recent developments concerning an assistive and adaptive technology to help violin students overcoming all these difficulties, and developing their technique and repertoire properly and sefely. In particular, we focus on the multimodal corpus of violin performances which was collected for the purpose, and on the analysis of such data to compute postural and gestural features characterizing the performance under a biomechanical perspective and in terms of movement quality. Analysis is expected to provide students with feedback for reaching a physically accurate performance, maximizing efficiency and minimizing injuries.},

The SAR is undergoing in situ evaluation while being deployed as part of the clinical care of paediatric rehabilitation patients at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The robot is equipped to lead rehabilitation sessions of up to 30 minutes under the guidance of a therapist, and without technician support or Wizard-of-Oz operation. In this paper we report on quantitative and qualitative data collected from 8 therapists participating in our study across 19 rehabilitation sessions. Data were collected after each therapy session. Our results show our system achieves a high degree of acceptance, particularly with respect to its perceived usefulness, and ease-of-use. Moreover, multiple sessions operating the SAR appears to strengthen positive perceptions of our system.},

  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries has long been recognized. However, the realization of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavored to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SMEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SMEs in Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporationpsilas (BSCIC) industrial estates is still in its infancy. It also identifies some significant barriers which are impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SMEs, and confidence on ICT of the SMEs in Bangladesh. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project and explores the opportunities and challenges of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SMEs in Bangladesh.},

  abstract={Exponential increases of available computational resources, miniaturization, and sensors, are enabling the development of digital musical instruments that use non-conventional interaction paradigms and interfaces. This scenario opens up new opportunities and challenges in the creation of accessible instruments to include persons with disabilities into music practice. This work focuses in particular on instruments dedicated to people who can not use limbs, for whom the only means for musical expression are the voice and a small number of traditional instruments. First, a modular and adaptable conceptual framework is discussed for the design of accessible digital musical instruments targeted at performers with motor impairments. Physical interaction channels available from the neck upwards (head, mouth, eyes, brain) are analyzed in terms of potential and limitations for musical interaction. Second, a systematic survey of previously developed instruments is presented: each is analyzed in terms of design choices, physical interaction channels and related sensors, mapping strategies, performer interface and feedback. As a result of this survey, several open research directions are discussed, including the use of unconventional interaction channels, musical control mappings, multisensory feedback, design, evaluation, and adaptation.},

  abstract={Crowdsourcing enables organizations to obtain dynamic solutions from large and diverse crowds of individuals. With the advent of IT-mediated ecosystems crowdsourcing initiatives readily possess a means to mediate, regulate and refine crowdsourcing sub processes including the process of vetting and selecting crowd membership (crowd specification sub process). Despite this fact there is ambiguity in current research as to what constitutes a crowd. Furthermore, traditional crowd selection processes show signs of limited application and are often conducted (i) once, at a fixed stage in the process and (ii) by the process initiators. This research-in-progress paper seeks to address constraints caused by the limited application of these processes. Firstly, a definition of the crowd is formulated from concepts identified in literature. Secondly, an iterative conceptual model is advanced from theory that facilitates the creation of a crowd tailored for tasks of varying size and complexity.},

  pages={1215-1224},
  abstract={Agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are critical in our society. Proper management of AFSCs is crucial for improving social welfare. Over the past years, digitization in AFSCs has emerged as a new paradigm. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing approach, providing a huge amount of information to manage AFSCs. Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine extensive studies on IoT-based AFSC. Our research starts with the identification of 346 articles in the relevant field from the Web of Science (WoS) database by applying rigorous filtration. Using the VOS viewer software, a network analysis has been performed. With seven identified clusters, this article recognizes the role of IoT technologies as Cluster 1: agri-food safety, traceability and sustainability; Cluster 2: AFSC sustainability; Cluster 3: AFSC performance measurement; Cluster 4: AFSC resilience in disruption; Cluster 5: AFSC integration and traceability; Cluster 6: AFSC transparency and coordination, and finally Cluster 7 identifies the barriers in IoT adoption. Thus, findings of this study offer robust guidance to link IoT technologies and AFSCs together. Based on these findings, propositions are proposed and a research framework is established. We believe the findings would help engineering managers, researchers, and government regulating bodies better plan and manage AFSCs for social good.},

  pages={608-616},
  abstract={Over the past few decades, electronic devices and computing systems have evolved from being rigid, complex and inflexible, to becoming highly dynamic, and responsive. While these properties have the potential to make them user friendly and human centric, they also bring about inherent drawbacks, such as user interruptions caused by a variety of system generated events. In general, interruptions cannot be eliminated and hence need to be handled since they are essential for activities such as interaction, event notification, automation, and so on. This paper discusses the fundamentals of system generated interruption and presents a comprehensive taxonomy that incorporates past and current works on interruption handling techniques and solutions. The paper also proposes a methodology and design process for the developing of interruption aware systems that are based on the use of knowledge gathered from users' preferences, surroundings and situations via information elicitation. These incorporate user based design techniques, learning mechanisms, and preference elicitation methods in order to develop models that accurately take context, user's preferences/profiles and situations into account while designing for interruption awareness},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={102290-102303},
  abstract={Global Software Development (GSD) is a widely used development practice because of various advantages offered to the customers, vendors, and other stakeholders involved in a software project development. However, GSD is not a simple process as it faces multiple challenges that arise due to the mismanagement of the communication and coordination process. Meanwhile, Requirements Change Management (RCM) is a tedious and high resource-consuming process in GSD, which is further negatively affected by the poorly managed communication and coordination mechanisms. Multiple research studies have presented various theoretical and conceptual models to overcome the challenges during RCM in the GSD context. However, the current methodologies lack in handling the communication and coordination challenges during the RCM process in the GSD context. In the literature, the researchers have concluded that a conceptual model can effectively reduce the communication and coordination challenges during RCM in GSD. Inspired by this, the current work aims at proposing a conceptual model to overcome and mitigate the communication and coordination challenges, while ensuring the effective requirement changes at offshore software development sites. Moreover, it would help multiple stakeholders in understanding and managing the necessary resources before initiating the RCM process. To validate the proposed conceptual model, we have conducted a questionnaire-based survey to procure the results from the industrial experts working in the GSD domain. After analyzing the obtained results, we found that the proposed conceptual model is effective to handle the communication and coordination challenges up to 87%. In addition, almost 87% of the experts have agreed upon the correctness, identified challenges, and the mitigation practices in the proposed conceptual model necessary to improve the RCM process in the GSD context. Furthermore, it was observed that 75% of the experts also agreed upon the practical implementation of the proposed conceptual model in the software development industry to observe the heuristic performance of the proposed conceptual model.},

  abstract={Recent development in the field of virtual reality technology brought new possibilities and exploitation of the old concept of stereoscopic projection. This 3D representation in combination with motion tracking of users and real-time interaction is present in actual products, such as HTC Vive, Oculus and Playstation VR, that are primarily dedicated for game industry. The research is focused on embracing the new possibilities of this technology, enabling to track the user's interactions in much immersed and interactive environment. This shift from pure observation of the environment to interaction with it allows us to better undrestand the user's space perception and decision making. During the experiment users were observed in the virtually modeled, well-known architectural icon, Barcelona Pavilion by Mies van der Rohe. The installation took place at computational design festival Sensorium in Bratislava and examined the concept of virtuality and reality as two opposites. Users were invited to take photographs in this pavilion, which reflected on recording the most interesting motives. Case studies focused on possibilities of using VR as a tool of analysis and design. Data gathered from user motion tracking and taken photographs were analyzed and evaluated to explore relations between motion and motivation in virtual space and relations in behavioral patterns of users to support the concept of movement in space as crucial aspect of space perception.},

  abstract={Human computation and crowd sourcing have become hot topics across several application domains. Indeed, some efforts have been directed toward emergency management to find ways to involve the public in disaster response. However, many tasks in disaster response can put the public in harm's way or introduce problems of liability. Furthermore, some human computation tasks are disconnected from the true needs of emergency response. In this paper we discuss the case of an important lost-and-found task -- reuniting displaced pets with their owners after a disaster. We argue why this task is a strong candidate for human computation by "digital volunteers." The goal of this paper is to articulate the design decisions and software engineering problems faced in designing and developing a web-based crowd work environment that supports a lost-and-found matching task.},

  abstract={International development banks provide low-interest loans to developing countries in an effort to stimulate social and economic development. These loans support key infrastructure projects including the building of roads, schools, and hospitals. However, despite the best efforts of development banks, these loan funds are often lost to fraud, corruption, and collusion. In an effort to sanction and deter this wrongdoing and to ensure proper use of funds, development banks conduct extensive, costly investigations that can take over a year to complete. This paper describes a proof-of-concept of a fully automated fraud, corruption, and collusion classification system for identifying risk in international development contracts. We developed this system in conjunction with the World Bank Group - the largest international development bank - to improve the time and cost efficiency of their investigation process. Using historical monetary award data and past investigation outcomes, our classifier assigns a “risk score” to World Bank contracts. This risk score is designed to enable World Bank investigators to identify the contracts most likely to lead to a substantiated investigation. If implemented, our automated system is predicted to successfully identify fraud, corruption, and collusion in 70% of cases.},

  abstract={Software Design Patterns (SDPs) are core solutions to the recurring problems in software. However, adopting SDPs without taking into account their value implications may result in breach of social values and ultimately lead to user dissatisfaction, lack of adoption, and financial loss. An example is the airline system that overcharged people who were trying to escape from the Hurricane Irma. though not intentional, overlooking social values in the design of the airline system resulted in a significant dissatisfaction and loss of trust. To mitigate such value breaches in software design we propose explicitly taking into account social values in SDPs. To achieve this, we outline a collaborative framework that allows for (i) specifying the value implications of the SDPs, (ii) developing or extending SDPs for integrating social values, (iii) providing guidance on the value-conscious adoption of design patterns, (iv) collecting and analyzing insights from collaborators, (v) maintaining an up-to-date library of the valufied design patterns, and (vi) incorporating lessons learned from the real-world adoption of valuefied design patterns into the proposed framework for its continuous improvement in integrating social values into software design.},

From a review of literature on bipolar disorder and interviews with bipolar disorder experts, we developed a framework for designing a persuasive monitoring system to support management of the illness. The framework applies a user-centered design process that is especially sensitive to the complexity of the illness, the difficulty of treatment, its stigma, and the goals of patients and clinicians. We describe our application of this framework to designing a persuasive mobile phone monitoring system. We discuss how our use of the framework can help overcome the special challenges posed by designing systems for mental illness: (1) accommodating a complex array of symptoms, (2) supporting an uncertain treatment process, and (3) maintaining a high level of sensitivity to the seriousness and darkness of the illness, as well as the social stigma associated with it.},

  abstract={At present, energy has become an indispensable part of our lives. While we are enjoying the benefits energy bring to us, we are facing challenges, such as ever-increasing energy consumption, limited energy resources, lack of robustness and resilience in response to unexpected disturbances, safety and security issues, costly impact on the environment and human health, and energy inequality. The transformation into the smart energy management system further aggravates these problems and introduces new challenges, such as the costly construction of smart facilities. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the energy system and the current status of the smart energy management system based on the framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart energy management system should take into consideration of the interaction between the smart energy management system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection management, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart energy management system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study enables us to improve preparedness, coordination & adaptiveness, safety, robustness & resilience of current smart energy management system and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption through hybrid, integrative & needed-based data acquisition, proactive communication and information sharing, adaptive decision making based on hierarchical knowledge level across spatiotemporal levels, human-involved and hybrid action.},

Hence, a reference model serving as a blueprint for ICT architectures for future cities is required - similarly as TCP/IP and ISO/OSI facilitated the growth and world-wide development of the Internet and telecommunication services. The current paper proposes a methodology for structuring the ICT landscape in a city according to emerging standards for Smart Cities on European and German level, towards the facilitation of extensible and evolvable eco-system of ICT components and stakeholders for Smart Cities. After introducing the standards and the methodology, two case studies from recent research projects are presented in order to validate our approach.},

Despite the paramount importance of stakeholder identification in requirement elicitation, it has been given less attention in the software engineering literature. [Method] For this purpose, we conducted a thorough Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on stakeholder identification (SI) and its methods in requirement elicitation. However, previously, a literature study on SI in the requirement elicitation was conducted. We found that no one has proposed any standard or baseline research method for stakeholder identification, stakeholder assessment, and stakeholder interaction up to date according to our knowledge. It provides an opportunity to update the current SLR on SI in requirements elicitation from 2011 till 2021 to search for a baseline methodology for the SI. For this purpose, we explored the existing literature research that involves the SI methods in requirements elicitation. [Principle Ideas/Results] Furthermore, we identify and capture seventeen research methodologies for SI, eight key stakeholders interaction methods, and ten stakeholders assessment methods in requirement elicitation. To further enhance the stakeholder identification process, we additionally identify pivotal information such as different potential stakeholder categories, stakeholder assessments methods, and stakeholder interaction methods. Also, based on the proposed SLR, we find out the existing gaps and new opportunities for SI methods in the requirement elicitation. [Contribution] These SI methodologies help requirements engineers and practitioners identify key stakeholders and efficiently improve the requirements quality. Moreover, this research study helps identify the effective practices used for the traditional and CrowdRE SI, recover consequences that can affect the effectiveness of SI, and recommend advisable SI practices to be employed in the future. This research study would help the software researchers and developers efficiently and accurately identify correct and concerned stakeholders to improve end-user satisfaction instead of considering it a self-evident task.},

  abstract={The increasingly higher and stricter requirements from the environmental directives and the end-users have made it more and more important to design products with higher upgradability that availed the producers of the possibility to extend the product lifetime, improve recycling ratio and decrease manufacturing cost. However, the changes of the requirements are unpredictable, so two approaches are provided for the producers in this research. One is to design products with lowest upgrading cost for the most possibly adopted upgrading direction. Another is to design product with the lowest average upgrading cost for all possible upgrading directions. Here, cost is determined by the replacement ratio of components when the product is upgraded, which, in turn, is decided by the assembly method and the component assembly sequence. This paper proposes a design & assessment method by employing term-rewriting method to analyze assembly method and an agent-based method to analyze assembly sequence of components},

  abstract={Doubtlessly, mathematics is one of the most important subjects in education from K to 12 levels especially for students interested in eventually pursuing undergraduate studies in the fields of science and technology. As it has been argued in mathematics education research, not only the content, but also the form in which students learn is important for mathematics learning. Particularly, an inquiry approach permeates through the mathematics curriculum of several countries around the world. Additionally, the use of technology to learn mathematics has been increasing in the last decades, requiring teachers and professionals in education to constantly explore and learn new possibilities or affordances in the classroom. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion about the possible and complex forms of interaction among students, teacher, mathematical tasks, and the electronic tablet (iPad) in an inquiry learning environment. An experience from a grade 10 classroom is used as a context to exemplify these interactions.},

This paper contributes to the literature on engineering education by providing new insights on how to implement the SDGs at the course level. It argues that combining core and transversal skills, along with case studies targeting the SDGs, is an efficient way to prepare the next generation of engineers to tackle the challenges of our society. Moreover, promoting critical and design thinking activities increases the desire of university students to put their technical knowledge and skills at the service of mankind and the planet.

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={90919-90932},
  abstract={Aiming at the risk assessment requirements of typical industrial control systems with integrated architecture of security and safety, we propose an objective and quantitative integrated security and safety assessment scheme based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). First, we establish a safety and security integrated (SSI) architecture for typical industrial control systems with security measures integrated into safety failure modes. On this basis, we establish a hierarchical model of risk assessment with SSI failure mode as an element of the evaluation layer, and then standardize characteristic values of various safety-related heterogeneous index parameters. We design an entropy weight method that uses Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) method to modify the correlation of multiple indicators as a parameter strategy for determining the relative importance of element layer and evaluation layer and then use the membership function method of fuzzy statistical method to obtain the membership degree of hierarchical elements, and finally obtain the failure risk level value of equipment and system by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Based on a typical distributed control system, we build an experimental platform to test and verify the risk assessment plan, and compared with expert experience parameter method. The result shows that the scheme takes into account the correlation between indicators which measure the SSI risk level of industrial control system, and the entropy weight method is used to evaluate the risk of industrial control system which can overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of individual judgment. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation of system risk is completed by using fuzzy statistical method in the case of industrial control system without prior knowledge, and the idea of this scheme has a wide range of engineering value.},

  abstract={This paper describes the “SeaweedPaddock” system to profitably grow and harvest open-ocean Sargassum sp. as a sustainable source of macroalgal biomass and biofuel. The US Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) initiated the MacroAlgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Research (MARINER) program to develop technologies to eventually sustainably harvest macroalgae at 80 per dry metric ton (DMT). The University of Southern Mississippi team is characterizing an unmoored SeaweedPaddock; analyses include tow speed and energy required to avoid hazards, farm design to minimize biomass loss, economical harvesting, and nutrient supply. Initial results indicate that nighttime “smart towing” could allow the SeaweedPaddock system to produce macroalgae at full scale at costs below the ARPA-E goal provided that Sargassum grows at sufficient rates during the day after having been confined all night in a moving fence and that sufficient nutrients are made available. Cost projections for a successful, intensive, scaled system could be competitive with current prices for fossil fuels.},

  abstract={This paper argues about the partitioning in hardware/software co-design and suggests the methodology applying extreme programming to complement the co-design. This approach, contrary to complex method in the existing development environment of embedded systems, arises from need of agile methodology in latest development environment which requires time to market. Through adding a guide line of extreme programming to the advantage of co-design, the synergy effect of general process is expected. The risk management such as the cost management and the time management is suggested on the basis of PAMUX(Partitioning Methodology Using eXtreme Programming) and also the action plan such as the group organization and process establishment is suggested on the basis of the methodology which increases the reliability of partitioning. Finally, traits and case study of suggested methodology are evaluated by Lego robot project and it allows the PAMUX to add reliability.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Virginia Tech is in the process of an intensive restructuring of its Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, driven by an NSF Revolutionizing Engineering Department (RED) grant. As a natural first step, discussion has centered on how the curriculum can be meaningfully enhanced to go beyond a mere reshuffling of core content without tangible changes in pedagogy. Accordingly, we have adopted the threshold concept framework, initially developed by Meyer and Land, as a lens to view elements of the curriculum that are often considered “troublesome” for students to learn and are both transformative and integrative in nature. We opted to frame the discussion of threshold concepts in terms of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), the knowledge associated with communicating concepts in such a way that others — primarily students — can understand. To capture PCK, we used an instrument called a “content representation” (CoRe). This paper describes one element of our sequential qualitative investigation, which had three primary stages: an individual reflection with CoRe, a series of focus groups discussing and synthesizing the CoRes, and the development of a culminating card sort workshop. The findings from the focus groups will be presented, which include the set of big ideas and the associated threshold concepts within ECE from the literature.},

  abstract={Design for additive manufacturing poses new challenges and opportunities for manufacturers to produce highly customised parts while reducing cost, production time and improving quality. Manufacturing constraints of conventional manufacturing methods, such as geometric complexity limitations and workpiece handling, have shaped the landscape of computer-aided design tools, which are therefore not suitably adapted to design for additive manufacturing. Furthermore, computer-aided design tools require a high level of training to produce appropriate models. Augmented reality and feedback technologies pose an interesting opportunity for design for additive manufacturing, whereby the interaction with 3D models in an augmented or virtual design space can provide intuitive feedback to engineers and designers, providing fast validation of designs, parametric modelling and opportunities for training and use in both professional and amateur designer communities. This paper will explore and review the opportunities this exciting new technology provides.},

  pages={21429-21445},
  abstract={The cloud-based computer-aided engineering (CAE) technology expands the application scope of CAE, solves the problem of uneven distribution, and improves the efficiency of the simulation resources. Consequently, various industries are turning to cloud CAE technology to design their products. However, to utilize this technology fully, we must overcome problems, such as impracticality, inability to handle complex analysis objects, poor data transmission, and compatibility, and poor industrial applicability. Based on the ASP.NET, VB.NET, and ANSYS Parametric Design Language, this paper establishes an integrated cloud CAE simulation system for industrial service applications. The system: 1) connects the dispatching manager through the network and 2) clusters the servers according to their load and usage before dispatch, thereby enabling users to access the ANSYS software remotely. The model can be built either by inputting the dimensions of the parametric model through the page or by uploading a three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) model that meets the format requirements. The material parameters and the boundary conditions also input through the page. Thus, clients can input their own parameters and analyze the server CAD. Finally, the CAE analysis results can be invoked by a page operation, saving meaningful results on the server to be accessed directly by users. The proposed simulation system serves the needs of users both quickly and efficiently. In the large-scale industrial application trials, enterprises responded favorably to the system. In particular, it properly solves the CAE analysis problems of small- and medium-sized machinery and equipment enterprises.},

  abstract={The rate-distortion optimized quantization (RDOQ) provides an excellent trade-off between rate and distortion in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), leading to inspiring improvement in terms of rate-distortion performance. However, its heavy use imposes high complexity on the encoder in real-world video compression applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on low complexity quantization techniques in HEVC, including both fast RDOQ and all-zero block detection. In particular, the fast RDOQ relies on rate and distortion models for rate-distortion cost estimation, such that the most appropriate quantized coefficient is selected in a low complexity way. All-zero block detection infers the all-zero block by skipping transform and quantization, in an effort to further reduce the complexity. The relationship between the two techniques is also discussed, and moreover, we also envision the future design of low complexity quantization in the upcoming Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present BH-ShaDe, a new software tool to assist architecture students learning the ill-structured domain/task of housing design. The software tool provides students with automatic or interactively generated floor plan schemas for basic houses. The students can then use the generated schemas as initial seeds to develop complete residential projects. The main goal of our research was to obtain evidence about whether or not such schemas can be useful to architecture students. A first prototype of the tool was evaluated with 78 students, with positive results. However, the students seemed to demand increased user participation, so they could contribute to generating better quality starting points. A second prototype was therefore implemented, allowing a higher degree of interactivity. The second prototype was evaluated with a new group of 50 students. From the two evaluations performed, it can be concluded that both versions of the tool were able to generate useful starting points (either automatically or interactively) that expedited the design process. Additionally, in the second experiment, we found that neither the nature (automatic or interactive) nor the quality of the starting point seems to have any effect on the perceived quality of the final projects.},

We propose that the landscape of healthcare delivery and associated driving forces can be characterized in terms of quality, cost, and the balance of online- versus onsite healthcare delivery. Additionally, we explore how the eHealthcare value chain network can be configured to deliver both feasible and viable eHealthcare services to the end user. This paper begins by examining the context of the evolution of healthcare and is followed by an overview of the value-chain network model that we argue should underpin any business model that is developed in the pursuit of the effective delivery of healthcare. We examine some specific value drivers of eHealthcare that result in adoption and the challenges resulting in non adoption, provide case studies, discuss the technology implications, and conclude with the directions that we anticipate being of consequence in the future.},

  abstract={Considering the increasing demand for large-scale MapReduce distributed computing, coded distributed computing (CDC) has become a promising technology to reduce the significant bottleneck of MapReduce computation. Despite its importance, most of the works on CDC have assumed homogeneous environments, where the nodes have the same storage, computing, and communication capacities. However, since many practical scenarios involve heterogeneous environments, heterogeneous CDC design is highly demanded to reduce communication load. Under consideration of full heterogeneity among workers, this paper addresses the joint design of function assignment and coded shuffling to reduce communication load effectively. We first devise a new embedded index coding (EIC) solution for the device-to-device (D2D) environment and prove its optimality. By extending our novel approach, we propose the optimal shuffling design for the MapReduce framework. Then, we figure out the optimal function assignment with the optimal shuffling design. On account of the prohibitive complexity, we propose an efficient greedy search algorithm and analyze how much performance the proposed scheme can guarantee. Numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm provides the near-optimal communication load with a considerable complexity reduction, while we observe that the function assignment design is vital for heterogeneous CDC by comparing with the well-designed file allocation design.},

Researchers have already noted the necessity to develop learning methodologies and systems which can support learners along a continuous flow of different learning settings. In this paper we present a learning system and a methodology based on the use of patterns. Students learn about design and architectural patterns by finding instances of them on the field, or by recognizing new patterns unknown to them so far.

Design, manufacture, and bench testing stages of the DTP PMSM, the two-level six-phase inverter, and the control algorithm are efficiently incorporated. A prototype of the multi-phase electric drive system is fabricated and tested. Comparison of the simulation analysis and experimental results confirms the effectiveness of the collaborative develop progress. Control algorithms based on dual d-q model and vector space decomposition model are both verified and compared via the bench test. Operation mode switching from six-phase mode to three-phase mode is also realized with the prototype system, verifying its capability in fault-tolerant and potential in efficiency optimizing.},

The results of the experiment show a high level of variability in the gestures performed by different drivers for the same function. This could lead to driver distraction as well as user acceptance issues if a gesture vocabulary is `enforced' in order to use these systems.

  pages={9:1-9:17},
  abstract={Computational creativity (CC) is a multidisciplinary research field, studying how to engineer software that exhibits behavior that would reasonably be deemed creative. This paper shows how composition of software solutions in this field can effectively be supported through a CC infrastructure that supports user-friendly development of CC software components and workflows, their sharing, execution, and reuse. The infrastructure allows CC researchers to build workflows that can be executed online and be easily reused by others through the workflow web address. Moreover, it enables the building of procedures composed of software developed by different researchers from different laboratories, leading to novel ways of software composition for computational purposes that were not expected in advance. This capability is illustrated on a workflow that implements a Concept Generator prototype based on the Conceptual Blending framework. The prototype consists of a composition of modules made available as web services, and is explored and tested through experiments involving blending of texts from different domains, blending of images, and poetry generation.},

  abstract={DFMA is a methodology which is used to select the optimum design in the early stages of product design. This paper deals with the modeling of pedestal fan using DFMA method. Method used for DFMA analysis is Boothroyd Dewhurst method. The aim of study is to analyse the existing design of pedestal fan and to identify the pockets of improvement and suggest the new design of pedestal fan with improved design efficiency. DFMA is a concurrent engineering tool that is used to improve the design of the product which leads to minimization of the production cost. It also shortens the product development time by reducing the number of components, increases the quality of the product as well as reduces the overall product cost by reducing the assembly cost as well as manufacturing cost. Part modelling of each component of existing design as well as improved design of pedestal fan was done with the help of design software. Increase in the design efficiency shows the easy assembly process i.e. less time taken during assembly operation of new design in comparison to the existing design.},

  abstract={Mixed-initiative decision making is a flexible and effective way for coherent manned-unmanned teamwork (MUT). It allows the autonomous adjustment of levels of autonomy (LOA) and the human-robot collaboration modes according to the task requirements as well as the states of environments, robots and the human operator. However, it is still difficult for humans and robots to understand each other's intentions and motivations due to the challenges of cognition representation and behavior reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-initiative MUT approach using coactive design and graph neural networks (GNN) towards explainable human-robot collaboration. First, an interdependence analysis table is designed for a specific manned-unmanned aerial vehicle task following the coactive design principles of observability, predictability and directablity. Then, a multi-agent dynamic task assignment system is designed based on a task model with key decision-making points. Finally, we have used the Graph Network Library to design a GNN model for adjusting the LOA among the MAV and UAVs in the given task.},

As part of this research, learners were guided into our collaborative learning system to give and receive feedback on each other's developing work. Using only data gathered from learners from the learning system about how they interact with each other, it is shown that combined activity is the best predictor of success in the course.

  pages={94994-95018},
  abstract={Large technology and software engineering programmes, such as enterprise system programmes, are increasingly implemented through a mixture of customer and specialist third-party resources. These multi-partner working environments can be thought of as a complex social system, which oftentimes experience various forms of conflict. This can be due to competing objectives and priorities of the various organizations, along with incompatibilities of team members within the work-based social network of the implementation programme. If not brought under control, conflict can lead to complex emergent behaviours and dynamics within the wider social network, which can severely impact the likelihood of successful programme implementation of these software-intensive systems. Using social network analysis and thematic coding analysis within a case study, we show that the project management of complex software-intensive implementations requires considerable focus on control and communication across the programme-wide social network of team members, which we represent as a cybernetic system. A conceptual framework has been developed that extends extant literature around conflict in teams by framing the individual projects and the overall programme-wide implementation as cybernetic systems. The conceptual framework illustrates how a cybernetics approach to conflict within enterprise system implementations, can provide new insights into how conflict develops within project teams. Finally, we argue that the cybernetic approach allows us to develop project management interventions to mitigate the risk of conflict development, or control and regulate conflict once it has developed. We conclude by setting the agenda for future research on how conflict can be controlled within the implementation of software-intensive systems, such as enterprise systems.},

  pages={1606-1613},
  abstract={Could a social robot use force to prevent violence directed toward humans in its care?–Might crime be eradicated, or conversely could excessive use of force proliferate and human dignity become trampled beneath cold robotic wheels? Such speculation is one part of a larger, increasingly important question of how social robots will be expected to behave in our societies, as robotic technologies develop and become increasingly widespread. Here, to gain some insight into this topic of "robot self-defense", we proposed a simplified heuristic based on perceived risk of loss to predict acceptability, and conducted a user survey with 304 participants, who watched eight animated videos of robots and humans in a violent altercation. The results indicated that people largely accept the idea that a humanoid robot can use force on attackers to help others. Furthermore, self-defense was perceived as more acceptable when the appearance of the defender was humanoid rather than mechanical, and when the force disparity between attacker and defender was high. The immediate suggestion is that it could be beneficial to re-examine common assumptions that a robot should never harm or risk harming humans, and to discuss and consider the possibilities for robot self-defense.},

  abstract={In collaborative crowdsourcing, the problem of maintaining solvers' motivation and participation plays a crucial role. It has been noticed that one of the major issues is related to the scarce capacity of novices to face expert users in finding good solutions, which leads to an high rate of community abandonment. In order to overcome such a problem the best solvers should be asked to illustrate the rationale of their solutions and to share the adopted heuristics before receiving the award. This procedure allows the less expert to learn by doing and see how best solvers innovate products. The paper presents the “You solve, I learn” approach and how it has been implemented in an original platform able to promote innovation, creativity and effective knowledge sharing. The software use and achieved results are demonstrated through a case study.},

  volume={40},
  number={4},
  pages={338-365},
  abstract={Decision-based processes are composed of tasks whose application may depend on explicit decisions relying on the state of the process environment. In specific domains such as healthcare, decision-based processes are often complex and critical in terms of timing and resources. The paper presents a variety of tool-supported techniques for analyzing models of such processes. The analyses allow a variety of errors to be detected early and incrementally on partial models, notably: inadequate decisions resulting from inaccurate or outdated information about the environment state; incomplete decisions; non-deterministic task selections; unreachable tasks along process paths; and violations of non-functional process requirements involving time, resources or costs. The proposed techniques are based on different instantiations of the same generic algorithm that propagates decorations iteratively through the process model. This algorithm in particular allows event-based models to be automatically decorated with state-based invariants. A formal language supporting both event-based and state-based specifications is introduced as a process modeling language to enable such analyses. This language mimics the informal flowcharts commonly used by process stakeholders. It extends High-Level Message Sequence Charts with guards on task-related and environment-related variables. The language provides constructs for specifying task compositions, task refinements, decision trees, multi-agent communication scenarios, and time and resource constraints. The proposed techniques are demonstrated on the incremental building and analysis of a complex model of a real protocol for cancer therapy.},

Within the European Union, several initiatives are underway, aiming to motivate, regulate and eventually orchestrate the establishment of capacity and enhancement of situational awareness, incident response, and preparedness capabilities, with an expected emphasis on operators of essential services and state actors entrusted with cybersecurity. In this context, the institution of cooperation and information exchange channels to allow for coordinated cross-border responses to large-scale incidents is particularly prioritized. Motivated by the above, this work presents a conceptual blueprint in support of architecting and establishing interoperable Cyber Security Operations Centres that combine capacity for situational awareness, incident response, and preparedness, also benefiting from the interplay between them, ultimately enhancing national cybersecurity capabilities, cross-border collaboration, and national supervision of their critical sectors, in line with current and upcoming regulatory requirements and the ever-increasing need for national and international cooperation.},

This reference architecture - for wearable experience for knowledge intensive training - incorporates head-mounted augmented vision, an array of wearable sensors that monitor movement and physiological signals, a data-layer managing sensor data and a cloud-based repository for storing information about the activity and workplace. Moreover, this architecture has been tested in a range of knowledge intensive workplaces, in the aeronautic, medical and space industries. Two iterations of the architecture were developed and validated, together with over 500 participants, producing datasets on activity performance, physiological state and assessment of the platform. The components and links of the architecture are presented here as generalizable design patterns to support wider development.

Argument diagramming aims at tagging the utterances and their relationships to represent the flow and structure of reasoning in conversations, especially in discussions and arguments. In this work, we tackle the problem of automatically assigning node types to user utterances using several lexical and prosodic features. We performed experiments using the AMI Meeting Corpus annotated according to the the Twente Argumentation Schema. Our results indicate that while lexical and prosodic features both provide orthogonal information for this task, using a cascaded approach, eliminating backchannel utterances improves the performance. With this final approach, when all features are used, we achieve about 9% relatively better error rates than a simpler classifier based on only lexical features.},

This knowledge, in general, is dispersed through several, frequently unidentified, individuals. Collecting, filtering and putting together the relevant knowledge pieces to create solutions are difficult tasks. Many domains fit this scenario of distributed knowledge and creative solution's needs including governmental decision-making. Democratic governments constantly need to make sense of population demands to properly make decisions that attend overall will. However, low citizens participation in government decisions through democratic processes is an aspect that defies democracy itself. Large-scale citizens participation is difficult for the lack of technology to collect, filter and synthesize information. To deal with this problem, we developed an intelligent mobile network that allows broad citizens' participation and feasible government action. Previous research indicates cellular phones as the device with the broadest acceptance in all Brazilian social classes. Sending messages and voting by cell phones are broken barriers to consider the device as the natural input interface for citizen-government interaction. Additionally, message summarization and clusterization help government understand the demands.

  abstract={The College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has recently launched a new B. S. dual degree in Innovation, Leadership, and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE), a second bachelor's degree option for those completing their degree in a traditional engineering discipline. This is unlike many universities where similar degree programs are situated in colleges of business rather than engineering. The first cohort of sixteen students has joined the program in January 2017. In this paper we first report on the stated goals of the new degree, which is meant to combine the technical expertise in the traditional engineering science-focused disciplines with a deeper set of skills in problem-finding, creativity, innovation, leadership, and externalization. The idea is to ensure training in the dual physical and human dimensions and triple aspects of science, design, and leadership that are present in engineering practice. Next we report on the curriculum design as well as the experiential learning pedagogy that is present in most of the courses therein. Core courses include “Design Thinking/Need-Finding”, “Creativity, Innovation, Vision”, “Emotional Intelligence”, “Innovation and Engineering Design”, and “Technology Entrepreneurship”. Further, we provide a characterization of the students in the first cohort of undergraduate students to be accepted into the degree program. Drawing on their application materials, we perform text analytics using techniques such as topic modeling under Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and geometric embedding using the word2vec family of methods, to understand the key motivations for students to pursue this degree. Finally we use these text analytics techniques to make a formal assessment of alignment between the stated goals of the degree program and the key motivations of the students. One particular question is to understand the students' relative level of interest in the three legs of the degree, namely innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship, so as to predict how level of engagement may vary across courses.},

In order to address this issue, this paper investigates the theoretical foundation of ontologies and extends the traditional ontology concept to an ontological view concept. To explicitly and formally specify the ontological views, a Frame-based Ontological view Specification Language (FOSL) is proposed. This language is based on the Frame knowledge representation paradigm and uses XML as the encoding. A prototype environment that supports semantic integration based on ontological views specified with FOSL is introduced.},

  abstract={Mental health disorders are a prominent problem across the world. An effective treatment has been the use of animal-assisted therapy; however not everyone can interact with and/or care for a live animal. Therabot™ has been developed as an assistive robot to provide therapeutic support at home and in the counseling setting. Therabot™ is designed as a stuffed robotic dog and has adaptive touch sensing to allow for improved human-robot interactions. Through its touch sensing, it will determine if the level of stress of its users is increasing and adapt to provide support during therapy sessions and for home therapy practice. Over time, Therabot™ is expected to learn the preferences of its user and adapt its behaviors.},

  abstract={The ORNL Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) provides the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and development across a broad range of disciplines. SNS experiments produce large volumes of complex data that are analyzed by scientists with varying degrees of experience using 3D visualization and analysis systems. However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve proficiency with 3D visualizations. Because 3D representations are key to understanding the neutron scattering data, scientists are unable to analyze their data in a timely fashion resulting in inefficient use of the limited and expensive SNS beam time. We believe a more intuitive interface for exploring neutron scattering data can be created by combining immersive virtual reality technology with high performance data analytics and human interaction. In this paper, we present our initial investigations of immersive visualization concepts as well as our vision for an immersive visual analytics framework that could lower the barriers to 3D exploratory data analysis of neutron scattering data at the SNS.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a whole new way for cities to deal with crises. More than ever, in order to protect the citizens, cities need to rely on data to address such a public health emergency. In this sense, the Urban Control and Command Centers (CCCs) are an important governance organism to help the monitoring and the management of the complex dynamic of contemporary cities. These centralized and integrated management structures in the form of a governmental agency can aid the decision makers into a more coordinated, systemic, strategic, and data-driven intervention. In Rio de Janeiro's case, the city Urban CCC - called Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR in the Portuguese abbreviation) - is mostly designed to monitor the daily routine of the different systems and infrastructures that compose the city's dynamic, to plan and integrate operations for big events like Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to manage emergency situations. With the monitoring center, Rio is able to identify abnormalities and make sure that any interference in the city can be resolved in a timely manner, in order to ensure that the city comes back to normal in the face of a disruption and runs as smoothly as possible. Regarding the context of the pandemic of the COVID-19, Urban CCCs can also be an important tool to manage health emergencies. In this paper, the case of the COR is presented, showing how this Brazilian city is using its Urban CCC to monitor and assist the authorities with Preal time data intelligence to respond to this unprecedented emergency.},

  pages={000021-000026},
  abstract={The objective of this research is to investigate the use of robots as intermediaries to gather sensitive information from children. The research is multidisciplinary in nature. The goals will be accomplished through the development of an integrated robotic framework that includes a novel architecture and an interactive user interface to gather information using methodologies recommended for forensic interviews with children. The Interactive Social Engagement Architecture (ISEA) is designed to integrate behavior-based robotics, human behavior models, cognitive architectures, and expert user input to increase social engagement between a human and system (e.g., robot, avatar, etc.). ISEA provides for the autonomous generation of robot behaviors for self-preservation and to convey social intelligence. The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable to different applications and domains; however for this project, the focus is on social engagement for information gathering. The interactive user interface provides interviewers with the ability to use a robot as an intermediary for gathering this information. The interface and framework have been iteratively improved through observations from user studies conducted to date with 186 children ages 8-12. This project compares the effectiveness of robot versus human interviewers to gather sensitive information from children using situations in which this would commonly occur - cases of child eyewitness memory and child reports of bullying. This research has the potential to transform how sensitive information is gathered as it relates to criminal investigations and proceedings.},

  abstract={This paper reviews recent attempts by researchers at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) to increase the level of student engagement in a final year capstone project by allowing for a greater level of autonomy in project selection and assignment. The paper introduces the context, followed by a justification from current literature, an introduction to the approach and finally a summary of the outcomes obtained by the project. In this study an authentic learning approach was followed which allowed students to propose and tender for capstone projects in a four-year engineering programme, and following a period of tender also give active input into the selection of tenders based on their personal knowledge and experience. From this process, a preference list was obtained from both students and faculty of their opinions of the best way assignments could be allocated followed by applying the Gale-Shapley algorithm to select the optimal assignment of projects to students. It is hoped that this study will inspire other educators in similar situations to consider handing over some measure of control to students during their undergraduate studies in engineering to increase the level of responsibility and thoughtful reflection experienced by students before they enter the profession.},

  year={2020},

  pages={96-105},
  abstract={In order to obtain a holistic perspective on learning, technical infrastructure at an institutional level can be advantageous for Learning Analytics (LA). If personal data is collected and processed in such infrastructure, legal requirements are of crucial importance. Recent studies have examined various aspects of LA infrastructure, such as ethical trade-offs and stakeholder needs. However, strategies for designing technical LA infrastructure at the institutional level and strategies for dealing with data protection regulations have been lacking so far, although they are crucial for the adoption of LA in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to examine three research questions: (RQ1) which strategies are currently used to design LA infrastructure; (RQ2) how data protection and privacy affect the design of LA infrastructure; and (RQ3) how could technical measures support the adoption of LA. These research questions were investigated by conducting eleven interviews with LA infrastructure developers representing eight different higher education institutions and ten different infrastructures. According to RQ1, the paper first examines the domain specificity of LA infrastructure and the four design strategies used. The paper also examines, according to RQ2, the interviewees’ awareness of data protection, the conflict with users’ consent, and the data subject rights. Finally, the paper presents, in line with RQ3, the results of the strategies in dealing with trust, stakeholder expectations, and engagement. Researchers and infrastructure developers can use and adopt these findings to improve their strategies for developing technical LA infrastructure with regard to data protection, privacy, and trust.},

  abstract={This work focuses on the improvement of a line of corporate knowledge management systems, knowledge repositories. For the implementation of such systems, companies can deploy important means for small gains. Indeed, management services often notice very limited use compared to what they actually expect. We present a use case of a five-step re-designing user-centered approach that combines a top-down content architecture, integration with other corporate information systems and adapted interfaces and interactions design to increase the use of these artifacts. Our implementation is done on the knowledge repository used by operators from Société du Canal de Provence (SCP),a French water management company. Their system was taken into production but very occasionally used. We describe the reasons for this limited use and we propose a design methodology adapted to the context. Promoting the effective use of the system, our approach has been experimented and evaluated with a panel of users working at SCP. Results of our semi-structured questionnaire reveal that more than half of the participant are satisfied and present a positive attitude towards the re-designed system.},

  abstract={The process of designing affective technology as an assistive device needs to take ethical questions into account. Although biomusic, an affective technology, has been used effectively as an assistive communication device in the context of healthcare, its use with persons with autism in a broader context poses complex challenges. In order to understand and respond to these challenges, a 3-day workshop was organized in Montreal to gather information from stakeholders, i.e. users on the spectrum, family members and persons who work with them in educational, work, and cultural settings, on the potential uses and ethical issues of biomusic. In this paper, we report some of the outcomes of this workshop from a design perspective, which we used to generate a framework for biomusic as affective technology. This framework proposes three distinct lenses: a technological one, an ecological one, and a human-centered one. We illustrate how this framework can make visible the ethical issues that can emerge during the design process and promote collaborative and concrete solutions that respond to user concerns.},

  abstract={Robotics applications in the raw materials sector are becoming increasingly common due to their many perceived benefits. In mining, the extended use of robotics is especially seen in the exploration and exploitation phases, where mineral resources are discovered, extracted and processed. The use of robotics in the mining industry started in the 60s and today it is seen in the automation of material transport or in robotic digging and loading. Potential benefits include improved productivity, decreased production costs, better operational efficiency, increased safety, reduced waste and, ultimately, more value creation. The increasing amount of robotics used in the raw materials sector is coupled with a series of ethical and legal issues, regulatory challenges and policy requirements that affect both producers and end-users of robotic technologies. The benefits and challenges of robotics applications, often overlooked by the stakeholders, can hinder both their integration in the sector and the further development of mining activities, if not properly addressed.},

  abstract={Results from a triple-blind mixed-method user study into the effectiveness of mixed-initiative tools for the procedural generation of game levels are presented. A tool which generates levels using interactive evolutionary optimization was designed for this study which 1) is focused on supporting the designer to explore the design space and 2) only requires the designer to interact with it by designing levels. The tool identifies level design patterns in an initial hand-designed map and uses that information to drive an interactive optimization algorithm. A rigorous user study was designed which compared the experiences of designers using the mixed-initiative tool to designers who were given a tool which provided completely random level suggestions. The designers using the mixed-initiative tool showed an increased engagement in the level design task, reporting that it was effective in inspiring new ideas and design directions. This provides significant evidence that procedural content generation can be used as a powerful tool to support the human design process. support for the research of this article.},

  abstract={How can high-level directives concerning risk, cybersecurity and compliance be operationalized in the central nervous system of any organization above a certain complexity? How can the effectiveness of technological solutions for security be proven and measured, and how can this technology be aligned with the governance and financial goals at the board level? These are the essential questions for any CEO, CIO or CISO that is concerned with the wellbeing of the firm. The concept of Zero Trust (ZT) approaches information and cybersecurity from the perspective of the asset to be protected, and from the value that asset represents. Zero Trust has been around for quite some time. Most professionals associate Zero Trust with a particular architectural approach to cybersecurity, involving concepts such as segments, resources that are accessed in a secure manner and the maxim “always verify never trust”. This paper describes the current state of the art in Zero Trust usage. We investigate the limitations of current approaches and how these are addressed in the form of Critical Success Factors in the Zero Trust Framework developed by ON2IT ‘Zero Trust Innovators’ (1). Furthermore, this paper describes the design and engineering of a Zero Trust artefact that addresses the problems at hand (2), according to Design Science Research (DSR). The last part of this paper outlines the setup of an empirical validation trough practitioner oriented research, in order to gain a broader acceptance and implementation of Zero Trust strategies (3). The final result is a proposed framework and associated technology which, via Zero Trust principles, addresses multiple layers of the organization to grasp and align cybersecurity risks and understand the readiness and fitness of the organization and its measures to counter cybersecurity risks.},

  abstract={Designing privacy-protecting Information Systems (ISs), i.e., realizing the Privacy by Design (PbD) principle, is a challenging task. This challenge stems from having many stakeholders and design trade-offs involved, which cause uncertainty in defining the problem, eliciting soft requirements, and making design trade-offs among many contending objectives. As creating a formal model of such settings is often infeasible, applying a conventional engineering design method alone may not result in elucidating users' needs and/or devising a viable design that is acceptable for all parties (e.g., end-users and data subjects). This contribution aims at enriching engineering approaches for privacy-protecting ISs with the so-called design-thinking approach. Design-thinking, initially used for product and service design, has been applied to the areas where there are interactions among people, organizations and technologies, in order to elucidate user needs and concerns that are insufficiently formulated and/or hidden in tacit knowledge. In this contribution, we elaborate on three main PbD components, namely problem space, solution space and mapping space. We, further, analyze the shortcomings of traditional engineering approaches for privacy protection as well as the potentials and shortcomings of design-thinking in general. Finally, we present our practical experience with applying the design-thinking approach to the problem of PbD for ISs. We foresee the applicability of design-thinking for elucidating the problem space as well as for making design trade-off among contending values in order to come up with a viable design option.},

  abstract={The greatest societal challenges are numerous, daunting, and seemingly unrelated, collectively spanning almost every discipline of science and engineering. Societies confronted with these complex challenges need to manage synergies and trade-offs across multiple systems, scales and levels of analysis. Unfortunately, if the goal is to overcome each of these challenges separately, we must embrace convergence as a means to merge disciplines, methodologies, and technologies, and we must do this for every one of the challenges, which is a truly daunting, and perhaps even impossible, task. Fortunately, however, societal challenges of the Anthropocene share the abstract common characteristics of broad scope, complex interdependencies, and multi-faceted causality, and also share several common systems. Seizing on this conceptual opportunity, we evaluate the “convergence potential” for systems-of-systems engineering methods. We then present a way forward that addresses the unique characteristics of Anthropocene systems by developing an agile systems-of-systems engineering framework and associated decision-support system to integrate fragmented data and disciplinary knowledge into a new systemic understanding. The proposed framework provides a fresh perspective on an entire family of societal challenges of the Anthropocene.},

From the study of city administration processes, supported by a systemic approach, it is identified a need to improve the efficiency and speed of the decision-making process, linked to the necessary improvements in this complex and constantly changing environment. Therefore, this paper presents a proposal of a methodology inspired by two other methodologies, which complement each other in order to provide the continuous, effective and rapid improvement of cities. This methodology was called Urban Continual Improvement and is composed by the 4U-Cycle (inspired in the PDCA Cycle) and the Agile Model for Urban Continual Improvement (based on the Scrum Methodology). Finally, it is demonstrated the importance of the contributions of Smart Cities Integrated Solutions & Technologies to the implementation of the proposed methodology and ultimately to increase citizens participation and improvement quality of life in the cities.},

  abstract={MindGym aims at improving the quality of life of older citizens and their caregivers by applying mind gymnastics that will keep the elderly active in vital mental shape. We plan to realize multidisciplinary research and innovation actions to achieve the following objectives: understanding the mental health conditions, preventing disruptive mental disorders and their early diagnosis, and mind gymnastic treatment. The target of this research is to influence mental conditions that lead to some mental disorders, such as depression, dementia, sedentariness, cognitive decline and personality disorders, which are present in older people, but can also be experienced earlier. The initial, understanding phase includes scanning mind activities using different audio-visual stimuli, by applying the sophisticated fMRI and EEG technologies to identify the regions of the brain that demonstrate increased activation with positive stimuli. Prevention is based on analysis and correlation of the results and will enable the development of a methodology for increasing mind activities drawing on the conclusions from experts about which audio-visual stimuli support the best mind gymnastic; as well as matching the results on various socio-economic, gender, religious, environmental and physical factors. An interactive system based on recommended audio-visual content, IPTV, social networks, cloud enabled devices and applications will be developed as a prototype tool for creating everyday mind gymnastics. Early diagnosis of mental reactions will be determined by EEG or fMRI technologies for various stimuli, enabling conditions to detect abnormal changes in the brain activity. This paper gives an overview of current research and projects in the area. It defines the basic objectives of planned MindGym research activities.},

  abstract={Despite witnessing an infinitely long list of large infrastructure projects dragging on for longer than expected, bursting the original budget, and negatively impacting stakeholders, there is no common fast-acting cure for the issue. The causes of failure are often associated with either human factors or risk management. One of the potential remedies for ensuring success for infrastructure projects of significant social impact relies on building tight collaborations. These call for experimentation with different mechanisms that have the potential to improve project outcomes and maximise end-user benefits. We consider the potential to contribute to the successes of socially impactful infrastructure projects by piecing together a range of smaller less-related projects that are funded, monitored and supported through the mechanism of cascade funding. With the assumption that the product of combined projects is more impactful than the sum of their contributions, we demonstrate a representative example of several successful use cases that, when combined, enhance the digitalization of water utilities and help maximise the impact of complex multi-faceted issues that are often entangled in large projects.},

  abstract={The purpose is to establish Mass Customization (MC)-oriented Customer Demand Response (CDR) service platform based on Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, the MC-oriented Demand Response (DR) process and the characteristics of CC are analyzed. Secondly, an MC-oriented CDR service platform system based on CC and IoT is proposed. Finally, the edge-cloud collaborative computing method is used to maintain the efficiency and stability of the CC platform, and the proposed method is compared with other state-of-art algorithms to further prove its effectiveness. The results show that the parameters  $\varphi $  and V have a significant impact on the queue size and operation cost. Compared with other methods, the operation cost of the proposed edge-cloud collaborative computing method is relatively low. Thus, the proposed edge-cloud collaborative computing method is more applicable in high-speed and low-speed data; it can also improve the resource utilization of the Data Center (DC) and reduce the operation cost. The research results provide a basis for the establishment of the MC-oriented CDR service platform.},

As a result of the signature analysis, it was found that the combination of detectors experimentally increased the detection of attacks by 1.28%. Software implementation of the proposed technique in the form of basic intelligent classifiers of network attacks can be used separately from the attack detection system in addressing the classification of attacks.},

  abstract={The role of data governance is experiencing a paradigm shift as organizations increasingly incorporate data governance to encourage the strategic utilization of data and, therefore, promote data-driven innovation. However, the opportunities arising from technological advancements and novel value propositions based on data come with implications that often stem from external and internal contingent factors, e.g., industry characteristics or organizational structures. In combination with inadequate practices regarding the conduct of data, difficulties in the adoption of data governance can increase. This article draws upon established practices from information technology governance and organizational theory, specifically contingency theory, to examine occurring antecedents in the adoption of data governance at Thales Ground Transportation Systems, a manufacturer of solutions for the railway infrastructure. By investigating the nomological link between antecedents, adoption, and consequences, associated implications for data governance can be taken into account in early phases of adoption to promote data-driven innovation. The article proposes new antecedents evolving from interorganizational dynamics such as data collaborations in the respective ecosystem.},

  abstract={The article is devoted to the interaction of imperatives and technologies of the "fast" and "slow" worlds in relation to the task of managing strategic communications of cities and regions.Fast worlds create technological platforms for self-organization of distributed cognitive and emotional experience gained by digital stakeholders during interaction with a territory. On the other hand, strategic meaning-making for the formation or revitalization of a place brand continues to be the prerogative of the "slow world". The vectors of "long history", traditional culture, architecture, landscapes, etc. work here. The article discusses the communication trends of territories arising in the zones of interference of fast and slow flows of place marketing.In the article the authors present their vision of the current state of the theory of place branding and image-making, based on the analysis of the works of foreign and Russian researchers (S. Anholt, D. Vizgalov, D. Houghton, A. Stevens, M. Kavaratzis, S.

In this role are active groups of people who have the potential to be included in the communication on the construction of the place brand. And also an attempt is made to differentiate communications with different groups of audiences in the contemporary context and taking into account current trends.},

  abstract={As robots play an increasingly important role in people’s lives, researchers are working on robotic vehicles with powerful intelligence. However, a problem that cannot be ignored is resource constraints on the edge. Considering the gaming issues of resource constraints and intelligence level, we focus on robots with limited computing resources and propose an idea of changing from lightweight to powerful intelligence for a smart robotic system. Firstly, we design a series of ultra-lightweight algorithms according to the lightweight resource Limitation. Second, we collaborate the ultra-lightweight algorithms through a centralized-distributed architecture to achieve intelligent upgrading of the whole system. Then, by maximizing the use of resources and information, we accomplish a heterogeneous ultra-lightweight multi-robotic collaborative system. Finally, the presented architecture has been applied to realize a lightweight simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Experimentally, the ultra-lightweight algorithm achieves 900 fps on the server experimental platform. Since there have been less heterogeneous collaborative methods, we further compared it with the state-of-the-art homogeneous collaborative system and proved that the accuracy of our proposed system was improved by 45.98%.},

  abstract={The increase in ease of the production of computer simulated graphics has opened new opportunities in the 3D industry. There are unlimited applications for the delivery of 3D Graphics especially concerning 3D multimedia presentation of digital content. Apart from aesthetic and entertaining reasons, experts apply computer simulations to visualize environments and to identify early errors or costs in order to limit the need of making real prototypes. Thus, 3D Graphics also minimize the time required for developing the final product. Existing 3D applications give partial support to users to engage in collaborative contribution for the production of a 3D model. However, when 3D artists are required to collaboratively produce a high quality 3D model based on thousands of polygons, they have to integrate the different parts of the model when the modelling process has been completed, which is a slow tedious process. This paper investigates how to dynamically and simultaneously apply changes to the same 3D model based on a collaborative network exploiting a Grid infrastructure.},

  abstract={In this article, a miniaturized fractal localized electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure for signal and power integrities is intelligently modeled and optimized with a K-means generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed EBG structure is realized with a combination of L-shaped bridge and slit patch, which is inserted by a Koch fractal resonator with a smaller electric length. To minimize the influence of the period EBG structure on the signal integrity, the fractal structure is only designed on the noise source and sensitive area with localized topology. In comparison with the traditional GRNN method, the modeling precision for discontinuous points such as resonance and antiresonance peaks of the scattering parameter curve can be improved with K-means-GRNN. Finally, a power distribution network sample with the proposed localized fractal EBG structure is designed with a steep suppression level of −50 dB from 0.36 to 20 GHz.},

At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger’s Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm’s history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.},

  abstract={Numerical simulation has become omnipresent in the automotive domain, posing new challenges such as high-dimensional parameter spaces and large as well as incomplete and multi-faceted data. In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration. We evaluated the new approach in the automotive industry, studying noise simulation data for an internal combustion engine.},

  pages={1206-1215},
  abstract={In Turkey, refugees from Syria have been continuously increasing with rapid urbanization. Concurrently, energy consumption has been growing promptly. Supply and demand equality may be a crucial problem in the electricity market causing further instability and shortages leading to reliable predictions a necessity. For this reason, an informative questionnaire is prepared to take the expert opinions on the main drivers that shape the energy consumption behavior of Syrian refugees. In total, 17 experts are interviewed. The answers are explored by using NETICA software for Bayesian Belief Networks. Factors affecting energy consumption behavior and also strategies, institutions, tools, and financing methods that change the behavior toward efficient consumption are investigated. Based on obtained results, it can be claimed that to be successful, electricity prices and tariffs in the market should be arranged in the favor of energy efficiency. Besides, support mechanisms by not only the government but also by the municipalities should be considered while setting related policies. Also, electric appliance producers should develop and implement strategies and actions to encourage the usage of more efficient appliances. Last but not the least, nongovernmental organizations should raise refugees’ awareness of the efficient electricity consumption to minimize the impacts of refugee inflows on the electricity market.},

  abstract={The goal-oriented requirements engineering supports the requirements management by using an approach driven by goals. These goals can represent either strategic concerns or technical concerns. Several goal-oriented methods have been proposed, for example KAOS, GBRAM, TROPOS, and I*, among others. However, these approaches exhibit some shortcomings related to multiple interpretations. So, the integration and comparison of diverse GORE (Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering) methods are difficult. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that SEMAT can be used for achieving a better understanding of the GORE methods. Consequently, the relationships among these methods are easier to treat. This work demonstrates the benefits of using the SEMAT kernel for representing the KAOS method.},

  pages={87633-87646},
  abstract={During the last few years, increasing emphasis has been given to geo-education in middle and high school curricula, transforming the way certain subjects are now taught to provide students with comprehensive knowledge about dynamics and interconnections in the world, which also rely on relevant geographic information. This is the case for history, geography, the earth sciences, and other subjects. However, so far, little has been done to provide adequate learning tools that can support such an important transformation. This paper proposes the integration of advanced geospatial technology in traditional interactive learning tools as a way to describe experiences that help students understand phenomena and improve their competencies. The system is the result of a usability engineering process aimed at providing users with an effective learning experience, iteratively analysing their expectations and needs with respect to geo-referenced content. The resulting learning environment, Maps4Learning, allows users to manage content in terms of learning objects named geoLO+, which are extended with spatial and temporal components and built according to standardized metadata. The system was tested in the context of a middle school programme. A usability study was carried out to analyse the impact of geoLO+ resources in terms of perceived quality, engagement, and student learning performance, and the outcomes of the resources were compared to the outcomes of traditional teaching methods. The results were encouraging and showed that learning improvement can indeed be achieved using Maps4Learning.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={401-408},
  abstract={Social agents have been mostly designed to engage with children one-on-one as tutors or learning peers. Besides this child-robot dyadic interaction paradigm, they have the potential to empower parents to more actively interact with their children. Robot-assisted parent-child interaction could be a sustainable future approach for promoting children’s in-home learning. Motivated by this new design direction, this work takes an iterative design approach to explore how we design triadic interactions through "lived technology experiences" and interviews. For 3-6 weeks, we deployed and remotely teleoperated a social robot in the homes of 12 families with 3-7-year-old children to engage in a triadic story reading activity with both parent and child for six 25-min sessions. Before and after the deployment, we conducted a semi-structured interview with participants on their triadic interaction experience and desired robot design features. The results of our qualitative analysis show that social robots can improve various aspects of parent-child interaction. We propose design guidelines for robot-assisted parent-child interactions at home, the considerations of participants’ values around technology design, and promotion of their long-term lived technology experiences as critical sources for design knowledge.},

  abstract={In the recent decades, accessibility received increasing attention. As a result, nowadays, established principles (e.g., Universal Design) contribute to creating products that take into consideration the diverse needs and abilities of all individuals. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the digital and physical world: while websites and user interfaces are adopting accessibility principles, most devices do not support an equitable use. Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it can be integrated in current technology without requiring any modification. We detail the architecture of the system and we discuss its advantages and use cases.},

  abstract={In an aging population, the prevalence of people with dementia is increasing. Intelligent environments can offer a solution to support people in the early stages of dementia, who often experience problems with maintaining their day-night rhythm. The focus of this work is developing an Intelligent Environment for assisting these people with their daily structure while living independently at home. Three co-creation methods with several stakeholder groups were used to elicit requirements and develop a prototype of an Intelligent Environment. Participants were involved in sessions using Mind Maps (N=55), Idea Generation Cards (N=35), and in a multidisciplinary design team with representatives of eight organizations. The result of these sessions was a set of 10 requirements for the Intelligent Environment on the following topics: context-awareness, pattern recognition, adaptation, support, personalization, autonomy, modularity, dementia proof interaction, costs, data and privacy. Based on these requirements, several scenarios were developed to explicate such an environment for supporting people with early dementia. The design team translated the requirements to a real-life prototype of an Intelligent Environment integrated into a demonstration home. The prototype serves as a basis for further development of Intelligent Environments to enable people with dementia to live longer independently at home.},

Good healthcare practices in daily living are essential for an improve quality of life and wellbeing. This review focused on understanding the purposes of existing emerging technologies that were used in healthcare and healthy lifestyle. This review was conducted using a systematic search and processes through selected digital databases. Based on the existing frameworks that used emerging technologies in the healthcare sector, we found that the factors that contributed to the technology use depended on the acceptance and adaptation of the users. Thus, it is important to raise awareness and create a proper framework on the emerging technology especially for the use of middle aged people before they reach their old age.},

  abstract={Cyber resilience moves organizations away from efforts to guarantee security of all systems, towards an approach that acknowledges that systems are bound to fail with a focus instead on the impact of that failure on business objectives. While the work on cyber resilience is evolving, there is a lack of studies using qualitative data for investigating the concepts and themes pertaining to cyber resilience in organizations. The purpose of this study is to uncover the non-technical organizational factors that contribute to better cyber resilience. By adopting a qualitative approach of analyzing factors of organizational resilience, this paper uses primary data collected through 25 interviews at senior leadership or board-level to point out the extent to which these factors facilitate or impede cyber resilience. The study illustrates a Leximancer map of each factor that characterizes organizational cyber resilience, based on insights from cyber practitioner communities through narrative interviews. This research contributes to a better theoretical and practical understanding of how cyber resilience within organizations can be improved. The findings show that cyber strategy and skilled people playa key role in adoption of cyber culture at the management level, while communication between boards and security leadership as well as a clear reporting structure are signals for building cyber resilience.},

Crowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE) is concerned with similar questions and employs requirements engineering (RE) methods to answer them. This suggests that the boundary between the fields of market research and CrowdRE has become blurred. This in turn raises the question: When is something still CrowdRE, and when has it become market research? This is an important question because it may require the community to rethink how industry might perceive CrowdRE in a wider context, and how future research should be framed. This problem statement paper explores this question along several real-world scenarios to trigger discussions in the community regarding possible solutions.},

The architecture of VR is used to define the component model and interactive topology of the Internet of Things application system, which is the basis of constructing ideological and political teaching system supporting horizontal interconnection, heterogeneous integration, resource sharing and dynamic maintenance. At present, service-oriented software architecture is the most commonly used style to construct ideological and political application system.

This paper compares and analyzes the reference models of ideological and political teaching, points out the differences in the types of teaching software components based on them, the principles of teaching design adopted and the structural attributes, and shows that these reference models are suitable for guiding the construction of Internet of Things application systems with different scales and different application requirements. The formal modeling and model detection methods of ideological and political teaching application system based on software architecture are analyzed. Finally, VR technology points out the specific work that needs to be carried out in the future to establish the application system development method of ideological and political teaching in colleges and universities based on software architecture.},

A team of students and faculties, as part of the Live-In-Labs® program, stayed in the village for one week to examine the health conditions of the villagers. The team probed the factors behind the alarming condition of poor health of Morasiya inhabitants, analyzed the prevailing treatment methods in Morasiya, and the services provided by the government-funded Public Health Centre. It was inferred that lack of a local health clinic, negligence towards diet and personal hygiene, and shortage of medical professionals were the main causes behind the poor health of the villagers. Co-design tools were employed to devise a solution to their health challenges. An IoT-based Amrita Smart Health Assistant (ASHA) solution was developed, which monitors and transfers data securely over MQTT to a cloud, which can be accessed and analyzed by medical professionals for remote monitoring of community health in villages.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper details the creation and implementation of a macroethics lesson into a required sophomore-level aerospace engineering course at a large research university. The primary, novel learning objective for this macroethics lesson is for students to analyze how their own ethical philosophy and personal values influence their perspective on an ethical issue in aerospace engineering. This paper begins with a review of the literature used to guide the development of this macroethics lesson. Next, the outline and content of the lesson is presented which consisted of two distinct activities. The first was an introductory presentation on ethics and identifying personal values. This was followed by students choosing an “issue brief” (written by the authors of this paper) on a current macroethical issue in aerospace engineering. The brief topics were the military-industrial complex, space sustainability and orbital debris, and space settlement and resource utilization. After reading their selected brief, students engaged in a structured discussion on the issue in which they identified and ranked stakeholders, and reflected on how their own values were reflected in their ranking of stakeholders. This paper concludes with a discussion of the impact and effectiveness of the lesson with reflections from the authors, and presents quantitative and qualitative survey data from the sophomore students who completed the macroethics lesson.},

This article provides an analysis of prominent interoperability standards for e-learning, emphasizing their role in the development of the classroom of the future. Although current e-learning infrastructures support the remote access to learning resources and on-line assessment, the classroom of the future will reposition the professors' and students' approach to education, and will include tools and technologies for personalized learning, virtual and augmented reality, cloud computing, 3D-printing, deep learning and learning analytics. Achieving interoperability among e-learning infrastructures is essential for the classroom of the future. However, the field of e-learning has grown without a clear vision on how heterogeneous e-learning systems should inter-relate, and interoperability remains a big challenge. We analyze relevant standardization approaches which in turn shapes an overview of enabling technologies for e-learning. Finally we look at challenges for e-learning infrastructures interoperability that can shape future research, tackling inclusive education.},

  title={Evaluating Factors for Effective Flipped Classroom Instruction in an Advanced Data Management Course},
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The following Research-to-Practice full paper presents the outcomes of a remote synchronous flipped classroom implementation of a senior-level data management course. As flipped classroom models of instruction have gained popularity in higher education, it has prompted the need for an investigation into content-specific methods for flipped curriculum design. Our work identified and implemented flipped classroom design factors in an Advanced Database Design (CIT 44400) course to address a gap in research around flipped classroom models within undergraduate data-science courses. Through literature review, we identified a set of eight factors of effective flipped classroom instruction and evaluated them via survey, focus group, course evaluation, student performance, and interview data. We segmented designed course activities which incorporated these eight factors with a set of learning objectives that emphasized collaborative iterative practices to position students as designers and evaluators of solutions to industry-authentic problems. Instructional design factors were evaluated via course evaluations and student surveys followed by an activity-based qualitative analysis of focus group, instructor interview, and student free-response data to understand student perceptions of instructional approaches, intended versus practical outcomes of such activities, and guidelines for future course design iterations and research. We argue instructional design must be student-centered and consider student goals alongside those that are ‘scripted’ into the course structure to best serve, motivate, and engage students. During the Fall 2020 implementation of CIT 44400, we prioritized learner independence, peer collaboration, and critical thinking in the instructional design, selecting flipped methodologies with the intention of fostering these skills in senior students. In light of Covid-19, the course was adapted to be synchronous online. Regardless of these unforeseen constraints, student performance and course evaluation data indicate that with peer and instructor feedback, students were able to apply course content appropriately in their final independent project as evidenced by a 12% increase in assessment scores and an improvement in students average overall final course grades from a ‘B’ to an ‘A-’ as compared to the previously taught Fall 2019 lecture-based section of the same class. Course evaluation scores also improved from 3.22 to 3.66 from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. Self-reported survey data from students indicate that (a) feedback from the instructor, (b) small group work, (c) revision of work based on feedback, and (d) solution evaluations were the most positively impactful instructional design elements throughout the course. In particular, students mentioned one-on-one scaffolding from the instructor as beneficial for their learning. Students also communicated challenges faced during the pandemic, complaints, and recommendations for future course iterations. Data from focus group discussions conveyed that students (a) generally had positive learning experiences despite the constraints of learning exclusively online and (b) developed the industry-specific collaborative practices which were designed into the forefront of our instructional model. The flipped classroom design and implementation process in this research is transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to design a domain-specific flipped model for their classroom which considers the needs of one's students, the challenges of the current time, and the state of the field at large.},

Noise simulation data analysis is challenging due to the data size and complexity. The Campbell diagram is a standard tool for noise analysis that summarizes noise for all frequencies and all operational points. We propose an interactive approach to a detailed analysis of the noise simulation data by means of interactive visualization. This approach, as an addition to the conventional analysis, provides additional insight into the data and facilitates the understanding of the simulated phenomenon. We deploy a coordinated multiple views configuration consisting of a parallel coordinates view, a 3D view, and three multi-view projections. The approach is illustrated using NVH simulation data for a four cylinder internal combustion engine.},

  abstract={Requirements specification in requirements engineering phase of SDLC has a great influence on the overall development of a software project. There is a huge amount of knowledge created and communicated during the entire process that needs to be managed in a structured manner incorporating both explicit and tacit knowledge. There is a lot of difficulty in documenting the tacit knowledge and consequently misunderstood or ambiguous stakeholder needs have aroused the researchers to devise techniques and models to minimize these difficulties. Due to the complexity of new arising systems, it has become difficult to understand the needs of stakeholders properly even with using the traditional models. Therefore, there is still not a widely accepted solution to all the problems faced in managing requirements. This paper presents a review and a state-of-the-art of previous approaches to managing knowledge in requirements engineering and also proposes a need for a better generic model.},

  abstract={A cardinal responsibility of a software engineer is to analyze a given problem and through semantic mapping, apply apropos techniques and constructs to develop viable software solutions. The dominant curriculum models for software engineers has focused on the solution space's declarative knowledge and has mostly relegated problem solving skills to that of a consequence of the primary educational process. In this paper we present a constructivist aware strategy to amend software engineering curricula by integrating problem solving skill development. To build this approach we examined mathematician Gyorgy Polya's heuristic of a generalized problem solving model in the context of software engineering (SE) and propose the necessary augmentation to support skill development. We take the position that Polya's approach may not only functionally address well defined problems encountered at an introductory level but is expandable to tackle ill-structured or wicked problems inherent in the design of complex systems. We present a controlled classroom study which investigates the utility of the proposed methodology to address a set of welldefined problems in a small representative student sampling. Our results show a significant reduction in time to solution given classroom support.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  abstract={Communication networks beyond 5G will bring about a human existence that is ever more virtual. Allowing new communication services with virtual existence and involvement everywhere is likely to redefine and place new demands on how humans can and wish (or do not wish) to engage with the connected network. The ubiquitous nature of the 6G network evolution enables increased involvement and affords more power to networks and machines (and those designing them) versus humans. This paper advocates that human-centric 6G networks should put humans' interests and potential first and foremost, in a holistic manner. There is a need to critically monitor, (r)evaluate, and adjust the above power implications. Human-centric design perspectives applied to future network technologies incorporate the human element more broadly. Thus, meaningful user control, empowerment, and agency should be key features of future network technologies beyond 5G and 6G. The network system's ability to protect human potential and humanity first, to serve multiple normative standards, while balancing the interests of all parties, can become a catalyst for stimulating better governing practices and for managing consensus building between individuals, communities, governments, and networked machines embedded with human-like capabilities. However, realising this vision and potential requires a thorough alignment with the human- and humanity-centric paradigm and a renewal of its operationalisation and implementation. This paper overviews a set of human-centric design interpretations and discusses the next challenges and implications in a beyond 5G and 6G context.},

  abstract={In the recent decades, accessibility received increasing attention. As a result, nowadays, established principles (e.g., Universal Design) contribute to creating products that take into consideration the diverse needs and abilities of all individuals. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the digital and physical world: while websites and user interfaces are adopting accessibility principles, most devices do not support an equitable use. Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it can be integrated in current technology without requiring any modification. We detail the architecture of the system and we discuss its advantages and use cases.},

  abstract={At present, the work of spacecraft flight control is in the downstream stage of the whole mission chain, and the flight control work mode cannot adapt to the subsequent space missions. In response to these limitations, a conceptual design of a work mode for space flight control from the metaverse’ s perspective is proposed. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is adopted as the basic methodology for constructing the flight control metaverse. A common flight control infrastructure is proposed as the foundation for mission system development. A flight control metaverse architecture that targets missions throughout the flight control process is built with extensive applications of AI technology. A new flight control work mode and a mission system work mode are designed to bring about systemic innovation in the flight control work mode. The former work mode features a model-based design of flight control schemes, agile and automatic implementation of mission systems, integrated flight control mission implementation, and parallel operation in physical and virtual spaces. The latter work mode comes with intelligent control, flexible deployment, and autonomous operation capabilities. The flight control metaverse presents a new mode of working space for flight control. The new flight control work mode that builds on the flight control metaverse can be used as a technical reference for the continuous innovation and improvement of subsequent flight control practices.},

  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has long been recognised. However, the realisation of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavoured to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SMEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SMEs in Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporationpsilas (BSCIC) 70 industrial estates is still in its infancy. One of the factors that have been identified as impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SMEs is access to, and confidence on ICT. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded enterprise growth and bank modernization project and explores the opportunities and potentials of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SMEs in Bangladesh.},

  pages={237-241},
  abstract={Servitization concerns the process of manufacturers shifting from a focus on producing and selling tangible goods to service-based business models. Factors that drive adoption of servitization are financial, strategic (competitive advantage) and marketing. However, uptake is slow and active efforts are being made to transfer knowledge about servitization to the manufacturing sector. This paper presents early results from the first test of a serious computer game which has the goal of educating managers about what advanced services are and how they fit in supply chains. Results suggest the role-play scenario tested is appropriate for an audience of largely non-expert gamers, and that the approach has the potential to instruct users about the role of services in the supply chain.},

  abstract={Over 1 billion people suffer from the effects of water scarcity with the majority being poor residents of developing countries. Desalting seawater is an excellent potential solution but reverse osmosis (R/O) desalination systems require a connection to a strong electrical grid. However, because developing countries typically lack sufficient electrical grid capacity and cannot afford the capital or time required to build and deploy traditional R/O systems, Resolute Marine has developed an innovative solution to this problem — a wave-driven desalination system (called Wave2O™) that can be deployed quickly, operate completely “off-grid” and supply large quantities of fresh water at competitive cost. A location for a pilot-scale Wave2O™ plant in Cape Verde has been secured and the site assessment studies, e.g. bathymetric surveys, wave energy assessment, and water quality assessment, started in Q2 2017 financed by the African Development Bank through a $1.0M SEFA (Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa) grant. During his presentation at the IHTC, Bill Staby will provide details of the Wave2O™ system and of the Cape Verde pilot project.},

  abstract={Software plays a critical role in our daily lives, providing automated support for various tasks in various domains. Behind many of the decisions that modern software makes is a data-driven infrastructure that attempts to create equitable, unbiased decisions. However, numerous examples exist of data-driven software perpetuating societal inequities and further marginalizing populations. How do we attend to software fairness? What are the best approaches for software engineers to be more conscious of the harmful impacts on the most vulnerable within our communities? Prior work recommends new tools to resolve the unfair and biased outcomes; however, the issue of biased inequitable software technology is an interdisciplinary problem that we can no longer solely depend on technical solutions. Instead, we need to incorporate interdisciplinary methods to help address the inequity of software technology. This position paper introduces reflexivity from the social science literature to motivate and encourage software engineers to integrate reflexive practices throughout the entirety of the software engineering process.},

  abstract={Almost every industry is facing a real risk of disruption from cutting-edge technologies. New technologies drive the Digital Transformation (DT), which induces significant changes in the business landscape. This reality forces companies to change and adapt their business models to remain competitive. While transforming digitally, companies also face the challenge of complying with sustainability aspects. There is a growing understanding by politicians, managers, investors, and scholars that it is not enough for companies to be concerned with short-term profits because natural disasters, social unrest, and economic inequality can affect long-term prosperity. This paper explores publications related to sustainable business models (SBM) and digital transformation (DT) to uncover common ground between the underlying concepts of sustainability and digitalization. A science mapping approach is applied to review Scopus indexed articles and conference papers related to SBM and DT. This paper aims to reveal the size, growth path, and geographic distribution of the knowledge base and trends in the common SBM and DT literature. It is the first attempt of a bibliometric review for this merged research field and shall guide practical implications and future research possibilities.},

This paper first describes the calculation method of the magnitude of the overcurrent, the leakage magnetic field and the electric power generated by electromagnetic coupling during the short circuit of the transformer. The existing analysis and calculation of the leakage magnetic field and electromagnetic force generally use the finite element integration method to solve the dynamic modeling of the short circuit of the transformer. Secondly, the transformer short-circuit monitoring scheme based on the principle of transformer internal electromagnetic and winding vibration is described: low-voltage pulse method, short-circuit impedance method and frequency response method, and some emerging schemes derived from these three methods, which have high accuracy but are mostly offline monitoring. Finally, the concept of transformer online monitoring based on digital twin (DT) technology is proposed. The DT modeling and monitoring prediction of transformer are carried out by four core technologies of data acquisition, data management, model construction and DT platform constructed with IoT as the carrier of human-computer interaction.},

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={118660-118675},
  abstract={Crop insurance serves as a crucial risk mitigation strategy for farmers facing uncertainties stemming from unpredictable weather conditions and vulnerabilities within the agricultural production process. Unfortunately, the prevailing traditional methods of crop insurance are laden with complexities, high costs, and, more critically, a lack of trust, which has deterred farmers from safeguarding their crops. Addressing these challenges, we present an innovative blockchain-based crop index insurance solution aimed at delivering multiple benefits. Our solution leverages blockchain technology to ensure unprecedented transparency throughout the insurance ecosystem. Every transaction and data exchange among farmers, insurers, and weather data providers is recorded on an immutable ledger, fostering trust, accountability, and confidence among all stakeholders. Moreover, blockchain’s inherent immutability and the use of smart contracts mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities in the crop insurance domain. Claims are processed autonomously, significantly reducing the possibility of fraudulent claims and enhancing the integrity of the system. One of the primary concerns of farmers, delayed claim settlements, is addressed by our solution. Smart contracts enable automated and prompt claim processing, ensuring that farmers receive timely payouts. Furthermore, our solution substantially reduces costs by eliminating intermediaries and streamlining administrative processes. This affordability democratizes crop insurance, making it accessible to a broader spectrum of farmers, including those in low-income countries. Our comprehensive approach integrates advanced algorithms for secure information sharing and interaction among stakeholders. We have rigorously tested the smart contract code under diverse scenarios using the Remix IDE, with the code’s availability on GitHub as a reference. Security vulnerabilities have been meticulously assessed and addressed. Thus, our paper presents an effective, low-cost, and trustworthy solution utilizing blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate timely crop insurance for farmers. By enhancing transparency, reducing fraud, expediting claim processing, and increasing affordability, our solution aims to revolutionize crop insurance, making it more accessible and reliable for farmers worldwide.},

  abstract={The cockpit design of civil aircraft is about smooth operation, flight safety and flight efficiency. The dynamic evaluation of the design process is obviously conducive to the optimization of man-machine efficiency. A system design method based on mix reality is proposed, and the system design and method verification are carried out with a large-type passenger plane as the target model. The proposed method focuses on solving the dynamic matching problem of virtual and physical scenes in human in the loop, and realizes the coordinated matching between rigid simulation and flexible human body. At the same time, the problem of dynamic access of general multi-source simulation data is solved, and the coordinated dynamic visualization between numerical data and image data is realized. Verification experiment shows that the system is feasible, reliable and effective in engineering.},

It applies to the acquisition or development of software products and services whether performed internally or externally to an organization. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the context for software products and services are included. The standard also supports the definition, control, assessment and improvement of these processes. These processes can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a system and its elements throughout the life cycle of a system. Users of the standard can apply the processes and terminology to construct a suitable life cycle model, composed of stages that use processes selected from the standard. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems life cycle processes) and this IS are fully aligned so that one may select appropriate processes from both standards for use in systems with substantial software content.},

  pages={129-142},
  abstract={Aging is a global phenomenon affecting the sustainability of national welfare systems. Care technologies are expected to improve the seniors' quality of life, remove the burden of the care personnel, and, consequently, enhance the welfare systems' sustainability. The effective technological development and integration of care technology has been actively studied and discussed, focusing especially on user involvement. However, few empirical studies have been performed on the required actions of the care technology developers for technology integration. Therefore, we conducted a multiple case study of the care technology developers to clarify the required actions for promoting care technology integration in the care service systems. Through semistructured interviews of six business cases in Japan and a qualitative thematic analysis of the individual ones, we obtained nine required actions for care technology integration that were categorized according to their major stakeholders and business phases. In addition, we carried out a cross-case analysis from the aspects of business types, firm sizes, and product types to examine the differences in the required actions. This article contributes to extending the research focus on care technology development and integration to its dissemination phase and the corresponding actions to offer an effective guidance for the care technology developers.},

  abstract={In this paper, we report on a series of design innovation projects conducted by student teams at the University of Colorado at Denver in collaboration with research scientists at the US Air Force Research Lab. The COVID-19 pandemic has made apparent the risks of disease transmission through multiple vectors in public spaces that could potentially benefit from further protection and safety measures. Utilizing formal ideation and innovation methods from the 4D Design Innovation (DI) process, the teams studied what specific problems to solve, explored potential solution ideas, and developed some early-concept prototypes for feasibility demonstration. Design Innovation (DI) provides both an overall process for product design and also methods for each step in the process. This paper details the correlation between the steps in the DI process and the results produced by the teams. The teams primarily focused on minimizing the risk of disease transmission through reducing the physical touching of common public items; additional solutions relating to contact tracing and social distancing were also explored. Initial functional prototypes were developed and demonstrated for: (a) touchless elevator control systems using voice commands, foot pedals, gestures, and touchless buttons; (b) an automated desk usage hygienic management system; (c) an automated remote video person tracker for monitoring compliance with indoor social distancing and room capacity limits; and (d) a contact tracing app. We discuss the prototyped solutions in detail, and describe promising ways forward for developing these technologies, with the aims of combatting the spread of disease and ensuring overall public health, safety, and security.},

  year={2023},

  pages={414-430},
  abstract={Smart learning environments (SLEs) leverage technological developments to enable effective, engaging, and personalized learning. SLEs rely on sensor and advanced interconnectivity capabilities to infer and reason. A natural set of affordances for SLEs are those of multisensory environments (MSEs). MSEs enable humans to make full use of their senses and equip learning systems with new information, methods of information exchange, and intelligent capabilities. In addition to novel forms of interaction, MSEs also offer novel forms of “learner traces” through multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). This article presents the results of a systematic literature review on how multisensory interactions and the respective analytics can support the use and design of SLEs. The findings from the analysis of 33 papers synthesize and clarify the latest advancements in the intersection of interactions and analytics in MSEs, discuss how those advancements can support SLEs' affordances and uses, and pave the way for improving our understanding of how various interaction modalities can support learning and under what conditions.},

This paper deals with this aspect by proposing a mobile application for the capitalization of business expert's knowledge in the form of business rules, which facilitates their management, in the industrial maintenance field. The proposed approach is based on the following steps: the introduction of business rules, the consistency check, the recommendation of business experts who are grouped into clusters with the unsupervised classification algorithm K-means, and finally, the automation of the negotiation phase using the extended CNP (Contract Net Protocol) protocol. The results obtained are very promising and make it possible to deal with inconsistency problems such as: invalid rules, contradiction, redundancy and rules that are never applicable.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that is digitally managed & records transactions in an immutable format. Blockchain helps build transparency, trust, and detectability, making it an ideal fit for applications where monetary exchanges are the primary activity. Initially, the technology was developed to support transactions, but today the innovation has acquired consideration even in other areas such as retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and government services. The manufacturing industry for centuries has seen work based on their bonding and trust with their stakeholders. As regular manufacturing plants are venturing into gigafactories, the support of several middlemen will complicate the process. Subsequently, this research paper aims to outline blockchain innovation in managing the supply chain and logistics-related difficulties by figuring out and analyzing it. The audit shows how blockchain can change the logistics and supply chain network into safer, lithe, trusted, and straightforward capabilities.},

Each has emerged and matured over the past decade and each has presented compelling and oftentimes moving opportunities to alter educational practice and to render learning more effective. The project seeks a novel way to blend these technologies and to create and test a new model for human-machine partnership in learning settings. The innovation we are prototyping in this project creates an applet-rich shared space whereby a pedagogical agent at each learner's station functions as an instructional assistant to the teacher or professor and tutor to the student. The platform is intended to open a series of new - and instructionally potent nteractive pathways.},

  abstract={Automated Teller Machines (ATM) are critical to banking operations due to their convenient and widespread use. Apart from queues reduced in banking halls, bank clients can still access services outside the regular operational hours. However, a rise in ATM fraud cases has led to banks improving ATM security by adding security ATM keypad covers, surveillance cameras, and even ATM security booths, measures that were not there at ATMs' inception. The academia is also replete with literature on various ATM designs to enhance the security of the facility and the user. However, proposed solutions rarely build on existing infrastructure and technologies, making them difficult to implement as they require additional equipment. For IoT-based solutions, testing is relegated to the communication of components without evaluating the practicability of the proposed solution. In an effort to correct these challenges and secure an ATM user, this paper introduces a conceptual design of a secure cardless ATM system that leverages existing technologies and infrastructure with little additional costs for implementation. A workshop was then used to identify improvements for future implementation. Recommendations from stakeholders and lessons learned from the workshop are discussed.},

  abstract={Construction projects are under increasing pressure from local communities to deliver Societal Value (SV), defined as integrated social and environmental value. Societal Value delivery requires the co-creation of value outcomes with environmental and community stakeholders, in addition to the functional benefits of the project. The aim of this research is to advance understanding of the conceptualisation and practise of Societal Value in capital projects. This paper will summarise existing research and key concepts in the delivery of Societal Value, applying examples from both existing and planned radio astronomy projects such as the Very Large Array (VLA, USA) and Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA, USA), Square Kilometre Array (SKA, South Africa and Australia), Arecibo (NAIC, Puerto Rico), Ghana Radio Telescope Observatory, and Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA, Chile). Such projects are built in rural areas, bringing services, infrastructure, jobs, education, and astrotourism to surrounding communities. Answering these research questions can lead to the development of a societal value framework for construction projects, including metrics and an audit methodology, for use by organisations and governments in practising project assurance.},

  abstract={Citizen engagement in Citizen Science (CS) means an active involvement of individual citizens in scientific research, policy and program development. However, it should be noted that including stakeholders in CS organisation, planning, decision-making, implementation of activities and evaluation requires adequate technological capacity, the understanding of roles and clear communication. The possibility to engage users in data science together with the power of AI algorithms presents no doubt opportunities for crowd sourced data science and collective intelligence to be brought to bear on fundamental challenges facing humanity like poverty, diseases, famines and developmental challenges. The focus of the interdisciplinary multinational consortium CLIMAS (Horizon Europe project) is research on empowerment of citizen scientist, researchers, civil organizations, SMEs, innovators, and policy makers by offering practical insights for co-creation of collective intelligence, aligning values and build trust between stakeholders. The project is based on idea that Climate Assemblies can be a perfect domain for participating in citizen science projects, with an active contribution of citizens by tackling environmental issues. In this sense, citizens participate in the collection of evidence, but also in the co-creation of new knowledge to increase awareness of climate change and ultimately to drive changes in climate policy.},

  abstract={Modern product customization aims at satisfying customers' individual requirements by providing customers various customization approaches. Recently, customers, especially lead users, are proven that they can play an active role in product innovation by using their potential user knowledge and creative skills. However, there is an obvious lack of systematic and deep research on customers' innovation or co-creation in current product customization systems. By customer integration and team collaborative creativity, a conceptual framework for collaborative customer innovation (CCI) is formulated in this paper, which proposes a new customer integrating approach beyond product customization. First, the concept and connotation of CCI are presented by comparing this emergent innovation approach with existing researches. Second, by studying the essential working principle of CCI, technology-driven knowledge spiral collaborative innovation mechanism and an agent-based team working model are formulated and described in detail. To realize customer collaborative innovation, the function structure of the innovation platform of CCI is analyzed and proposed. An innovation platform for household ceramic products is constructed as the application of CCI, and a case study is presented to validate the above principle and working model. The proposed conceptual framework for CCI can be used to build the collaborative customer innovation organization, develop innovation toolkits, and instruct enterprises to realize CCI effectively.},

  volume={11},

  pages={112362-112383},
  abstract={The creation of sustainable artificial tropical forests is of utmost importance for addressing critical environmental issues like deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change. This research paper presents an innovative approach that considers ecological, socioeconomic, and technological factors. The proposed approach integrates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that take into account the preferences and opinions of stakeholders. To analyze the various criteria involved, cubic picture fuzzy numbers (CPFNs) are utilized. To ensure fairness in evaluating CPFNs, the study focuses on developing operational laws and aggregation operators that promote neutrality and fairness. Specifically, the paper introduces the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly weighted average (CPFFWA) operator” and the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly ordered weighted averaging (CPFFOWA) operator.” By considering stakeholders and prioritizing their long-term sustainability and resilience, this approach proves to be highly valuable for policymakers, forest managers, and other relevant parties. This research avenue bridges the gap in current literature where limited exploration of fairly aggregation operators in tandem with picture fuzzy sets within tropical forest contexts exists. Ultimately, the research strives to contribute to the practical management of these vital ecosystems, fostering environmental conservation and sustainability through a cross-disciplinary approach amalgamating ecology, fuzzy logic, decision theory, and environmental science.},

  abstract={Demand is growing for markerless augmented reality (AR) experiences, but designers of the real-world spaces that host them still have to rely on inexact, qualitative guidelines on the visual environment to try and facilitate accurate pose tracking. Furthermore, the need for visual texture to support markerless AR is often at odds with human aesthetic preferences, and understanding how to balance these competing requirements is challenging due to the siloed nature of the relevant research areas. To address this, we present an integrated design methodology for AR spaces, that incorporates both tracking and human factors into the design process. On the tracking side, we develop the first VI-SLAM evaluation technique that combines the flexibility and control of virtual environments with real inertial data. We use it to perform systematic, quantitative experiments on the effect of visual texture on pose estimation accuracy; through 2000 trials in 20 environments, we reveal the impact of both texture complexity and edge strength. On the human side, we show how virtual reality (VR) can be used to evaluate user satisfaction with environments, and highlight how this can be tailored to AR research and use cases. Finally, we demonstrate our integrated design methodology with a case study on AR museum design, in which we conduct both VI-SLAM evaluations and a VR-based user study of four different museum environments.},

  abstract={The foundation of a smart and connected community is its advanced digital infrastructure. Kilobits of bandwidth to the home and smart business became available in the 1970s via dial-up. Two decades after that in the 1990s, megabits became available via cable modem. Another two decades introduced gigabit to the home and small business in the 2010s. Gigabit networking to the home and small business has created a gigabit frontier of new applications. Gigabit has changed the game for applications delivered to homes and small businesses in three fundamental ways: increased flow size, reduced response times, and ability to accommodate multiple segregated flows of differential Quality of Experience. Examples of US Ignite gigabit applications and services deployed within the 30 US Ignite Smart Gigabit Communities are discussed. The COVID-19 pandemic adds additional rationale for gigabit networking. Future applications for gigabit applications that may arrive later in the 2020s are discussed. Academics are beginning to experiment with terabit networking which appears to be on-schedule for deployment to homes and small businesses in the 2030s.},

In this paper the author concentrates on housing scenarios which were evaluated by VTT in Finland and by Legrand in France. According to the evaluation results the main challenge with housing systems is co-operation with existing house information systems. The users are not carrying their mobile phones with them at home, so the mobile phone centric system has to be based on the mobile phone connecting to the existing house network. Preventing problems (water leaks, unwanted visitors etc.) is one of the main positive effects that the potential users of a new technology valued. Extensive automation of home system raised fears but also advantages were noticed particularly for certain user groups},

With this regard, patient portals are frequently referenced for enabling patient integration. Existing solutions primarily focus on the access to electronic health records but do not aim for the integration of cross institutional information about the course of treatment itself - known as patient pathway. Thus, this paper proposes a reference architecture for the integration of pathway systems into patient portals. High-level requirements have been captured from both a user's perspective and a theory perspective. Therefore, a large-scale patient survey was conducted within a general design science research approach. They were transformed into appropriate modules and components of a reference architecture. Its applicability is demonstratively shown by the development of a patient portal for Multiple Sclerosis patients.},

  abstract={Companies have been increasingly opting to utilize project teams to contend with highly turbulent and dynamic conditions while under current uncertainty markets, stakeholders have tremendous influences on the performance of R&D projects. For example, as a key internal stakeholder, the top manager’s decisions including budget, personnel et al. could be vital for a R&D project team. The different interests among different internal and external stakeholders’ make the problem more complex. In this paper, we utilize the neural network algorithm to simulate the decisions from the top manager. With the data from non-industrial robotic R&D project teams in Japan, a neural network model of the top manager is constructed. Afterwards we design role-play card games to reconstruct the R&D processes of project teams. Two types of card, stakeholder card and technology card, are randomly allocated to the participants. Participants then decide their R&D strategies and the strategies are evaluated by the neural network model. From the role-play card game simulation, we find that there are some factors which are critical for the success of the R&D project team.},

  abstract={The large increase in computer network usage, and the huge amount of sensitive data being stored and transferred through them, has escalated the attacks and invasions on these networks. Intrusion detection systems help in detecting these attacks, but the large amount of false positives has decreased their usability. Different methods have been proposed to reduce the amount of these false positives, which consist of different classification methods. Aggregation of similar alerts is a method proposed to reduce false positives and the large number of alerts, but the problem is assigning similar alerts the same classification parameters. Rules have been created which correlate alerts based on three parameters, but the alerts should be labeled with these parameters. Labeling these alerts, is a time consuming task, because deep knowledge on each alert is required to correctly identify the parameters. This time consuming job has been done on 13000 Emerging Threats Snort signatures, and has been used as a knowledge base to label other alerts. In this paper a method has been proposed to label similar signatures automatically. This method uses word extraction from signatures to identify the words which can specify these labels automatically. To test the method around 1000 signatures, which have been classified manually, were classified by this method and the precision and recall has been computed. The results show that a large number of signatures can be classified using this method.},

  abstract={This research introduces the interactive process design of an Ice Breaking Stage. The Ice Breaking Stage serves as the starting point for participants in cross-disciplinary teams to engage in an Empathy game. The purpose of this stage is to allow team members from different disciplines to understand each other's personality traits. Thoughts, and perspectives through interactive activities and collaborative tasks. Based on the literature review, a conceptualized interactive process can be designed using visualizations, problem prompts, role-playing, and scenario simulations. The steps involved in the Ice Breaking Stage design include role review, initial sharing, system assistance, sharing created scenarios, simulating role-playing, and sharing solutions. All are aimed at guiding participants into a simulated role-playing scenario. Through user testing and preliminary research analysis, this study explores the digital-assisted interactive design method of the Ice Breaking Stage, focusing on sustainable development. The method utilizes genetic algorithms to generate virtual creatures with different body parts, enhancing knowledge sharing and the introductory process among team members. The research outcomes include the generation of virtual dynamic creatures using square and spherical shapes, with observed smooth dynamic operations. However, the combination of square-shaped creatures showed inconsistency, occasional movement pauses, and collision issues. On the other hand, the combination of spherical creatures visually presented smoother results. Additionally, user interface and derivative designs to generate virtual dynamic creatures can assist users in creating different contextual combinations. This approach is feasible. Future directions for exploration may include considering selection patterns and expanding the combination models of creatures and body parts. Adjusting variations in geometric shapes, size controls, and interface visual displays.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={352-357},
  abstract={In response to globalization and increased competition, individual professionals in a single field often cannot provide comprehensive solutions. Collaboration among professionals from different disciplines is required to find more effective solutions. This study aims to develop a system called AIGC (AI Generated Content) to facilitate idea convergence in interdisciplinary teams. The system aims to address the collaboration challenges between engineering and design fields and facilitate consensus through the introduction of images and visual elements. To achieve this goal, qualitative research methods were employed, including contextual interviews, the KJ method, brainstorming, personas, and user journey mapping, among others. These methods were chosen because they provide in-depth understanding of communication and collaboration patterns among participants and offer valuable insights. The selection of participants was based on their experience and expertise in interdisciplinary projects. Students from design and engineering fields were chosen as research participants to ensure diversity and representativeness. During the execution of the study, the research team collected data through contextual interviews and related qualitative research methods. The steps involved in contextual interviews included selecting appropriate scenarios, designing relevant guided questions, and conducting face-to-face interviews. Through these methods, we gained deep insights into participants' communication patterns, thought processes, and collaboration needs. The results of this study demonstrate that the AIGC system, which facilitates interdisciplinary idea convergence, effectively promotes consensus among participants. This is achieved through interactive processes such as selecting images, describing images, and engaging in interactive design. The application of the system is significant in addressing collaboration challenges between the engineering and design fields and holds potential value in enhancing teamwork and creative output.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic brought into focus the crucial role of computational modeling and simulation in informing and/or advising governments and societies, demonstrating the profound influence that modelers can have, particularly in times of crisis. This global experience has (re)shaped political and public demands on science and technology and the ways in which we incorporate scientific findings in our everyday lives. Through a brief review of models developed for COVID-19, this paper discusses the urgent need to move towards ‘responsible modeling’ in which social, ethical, and cultural issues claim the same importance as technical aspects. This includes a new social contract between modeler and society on one hand, and science and policy on the other hand. The characteristics of modeling work under this new paradigm, however, are still not well understood and are a topic of debate. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new research agenda that can facilitate the discussion about ‘responsible modeling’ and the overarching principles that underpin the concept’s aims and objectives.},

  abstract={Currently, risk assessment is more of an art than a science. In this paper, we demonstrate how a previously proposed theoretical risk assessment framework that focuses on making risk assessment more scientific can be implemented and applied to cloud networks. Our work offers a practical risk assessment implementation for cloud networks where disparate network owners can directly measure network risks in an objective, uniform and repeatable manner across networks by allowing the network owners to collaboratively agree on risk metrics and continuously monitor their cloud networks with the same tool, which employs these agreed upon metrics. The end result is a science-based risk metric (SBRM) based on the global impact of the vulnerabilities in the network. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this SBRM by: (1) imposing real vulnerabilities on realistic cloud networks built from real hardware (multi-core 3 Ghz Xeon Deterlab servers), (2) demonstrating the operational use of our risk assessment implementation to measure risk across several emulated cloud networks, and (3) describing our approach.},

  abstract={Figures within biomedical articles present essential evidence of the relevance of a publication in a curation workflow. In particular, visual cues of the image modality or experimental methods can help expert curators identify relevant papers from an increasing number of publications. Automating the identification of these content-bearing images can thus be helpful in computer-assisted curation. However, the paucity of labeled datasets and the specialized training required to label such images hinder the development of such tools. To address this problem, we present the design of ANIMO, a labeling system that integrates extraction and segmentation tools to ease the annotation burden. We first introduce two taxonomies of image modalities and experimental methods, derived in collaboration with curators. On the back-end of the system, we process batches of documents and create a labeling task per document. At the front-end, expert curators can access these tasks through a web interface and access the article of interest. We describe the evaluation of this system by a group of biocurators, and the human factor lessons learned from this interdisciplinary experience.},

RE activities are central to software development and its success. Advances in automation have been explored in requirements engineering activities and processes in the industry. However, the application of automated support is still limited in practice. In this study, we examine automated RE support in agile development through a qualitative analysis using industry experts. We have found that the application of automated RE support tools is primarily in the experimental stage, largely due to the limited practical implementation in industry settings. The current focus has been on research experiments, with relatively fewer instances of real-world industry application. Although experts are optimistic about its huge potential to reduce development efforts and costs if automation is harnessed. Therefore, we anticipate that these findings will be beneficial for practitioners responsible for developing RE tools for agile development, as well as for the researchers.},

However, AAC devices do not support nonverbal communication, which allows people to take turns, regulate conversation dynamics, and express intentions. Nonverbal communication requires motion, which is often challenging for AAC users to produce due to motor constraints. In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as “sidekicks,” might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers’ goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing. We show how these parameters manifest in appearance and behavior and how they can guide future designs for augmented nonverbal communication.},

  abstract={Most companies in India who are under the ambit of Companies Act 2013 are mandated to participate, communicate, and create social impact at the bottom of the pyramid, through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has also gained prominence in academic research through several challenges exposed due to the mandated CSR in India. There are already several research studies were conducted to understand various aspects of CSR. Researchers in some studies carried out research with the help of methods and techniques of qualitative analysis from the data collected from traditional sources of communication like print media and electronic media. In recent times, social media has emerged as a compelling communication platform with its remarkable contribution to providing a haven for its users to express their freedom of speech. However, academic literature still lacks empirical research that show how companies in India are performing through social media communication. Among all the available social media platforms, Twitter is popular globally and most dominant for communication and impact. Also, since Twitter is widely used by all layers of society, from the most influential people and the most powerful organizations to the common person, and the tweets contain massive data. In this paper, the authors have used sentiment analysis for evaluating the communication of the Indian companies of Indian. The study is based on a sample of 9,000 plus Tweets during a month. Using the cloud based and sentiment analysis the authors have analyzed the communication of these companies.},

It interconnects smart things and provides advanced building management systems, smart city services, participatory sensing applications which improve every day's life. IoT hold wide range of physical objects embedded with tags, sensors, devices that had not been involved with internet and allow them to interact to provide IoT applications. The adoption of IoT is ubiquitous but it also arises the major concerns about “Privacy”. Privacy includes the secretion of personal information as well as therapy of data. This paper accommodates systematic literature review of privacy threats and challenges along with the techniques used to deal and address them which emerged in the research literature. I observed that very rare models consented to eliminate privacy aspects. I also analyzed that the focus of the multiple solution providers was user-centric point of view. Not one of the existing surveys analyze the privacy of IoT in terms of organized analysis of the privacy fundamentals and approaches. There is need to work on it.},

  abstract={Systems often inspire the development of new models to manage size and complexity challenges in system development. Engineers should be aware of overlap in the models used for systems engineering of systems as it would be inefficient to reiterate overlapping tasks. The objective of this article is to identify consistencies between two models that appear to have overlapping tasks: Goal-Function Trees (GFTs) and value models. Both models are perceived to represent information about the system and stakeholder preferences, but have historically used differing processes and language. An analysis of the functional use and terminology for the two models reveals consistencies. The two models are compared in this article using content analysis of systems engineering academic literature. It is seen that physics-based system representation and stakeholder preference incorporation are often common to both models. A coffee maker is used to illustrate the potential consistencies and overlapping tasks between the models. Extending this simple example, the applicability of the models to space systems is discussed. The findings of this article can be used by systems engineers to improve their efficiency when applying both GFTs and value models.},

  abstract={Evidences across industries including telecommunication, retail and trading, suggests many benefits are to be gained from automation. To obtain these benefits in the field of healthcare, there have been vast amount of studies conducted on utilization of technological capabilities during the past few decades. From medical information systems to Telemedicine to ubiquitous computing, smart and connected health applications are designed to have a positive impact on current and future health care practices. While there have been a lot of successful innovations in these applications, there have also been a lot of failure. Study of these applications highlights the importance of user involvements from the very early stage of new product development. This paper utilizes the categories identified in Smart and Connected Health (SCH) terminology recognized by National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct a holistic study of different technological applications developed for healthcare to identify major barriers inhibiting their diffusion. The User Centered Design (UCD) methodologies proven valuable in industrial contexts are reviewed to highlight their characteristics and capabilities to facilitate user involvement. It references cases where they have been valuable toolkits to address barriers recognized. Finally, the study categorizes the major barriers captured throughout the study and recommends best user centered design(s) approaches to be deployed for superior front-end management of healthcare solution innovation.},

  abstract={Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems have been widely used to support teamwork in various fields such as design, education, research projects, etc. However, there is a great deal of knowledge generated directly or indirectly in the process of collaboration which is not well utilized and usually ignored instead of being reused and shared to help improve work efficiency. To bridge the gap between knowledge generation and utilization through CSCW, in this paper, we propose a knowledge mining based collaborative framework and first apply it to manufacturing value chains to achieve better work efficiency and reduce repetitive work in collaboration. Overall, this paper introduces the following novel insights and innovations: (1) we argue that there is a gap between the generated knowledge and the utilization of it during cooperative work; (2) a novel collaborative framework with knowledge mining approaches is proposed to bridge the gap; (3) a prototype system is further built and first applied to the manufacturing value chains. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to deal with knowledge reusing in CSCW of manufacturing value chains.},

  abstract={Successful, enjoyable group interactions are important in public and personal contexts, especially for teenagers whose peer groups are important for self-identity and self-esteem. Social robots seemingly have the potential to positively shape group interactions, but it seems difficult to effect such impact by designing robot behaviors solely based on related (human interaction) literature. In this article, we take a user-centered approach to explore how teenagers envisage a social robot "group assistant". We engaged 16 teenagers in focus groups, interviews, and robot testing to capture their views and reflections about robots for groups. Over the course of a two-week summer school, participants co-designed the action space for such a robot and experienced working with/wizarding it for 10+ hours. This experience further altered and deepened their insights into using robots as group assistants. We report results regarding teenagers’ views on the applicability and use of a robot group assistant, how these expectations evolved throughout the study, and their repeat interactions with the robot. Our results indicate that each group moves on a spectrum of need for the robot, reflected in use of the robot more (or less) for ice-breaking, turn-taking, and fun-making as the situation demanded.},

  abstract={Many museums have begun to pay attention to the application of the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique for protecting and displaying the cultural heritage. This is because it can demonstrate the 3D shape of the relics with high precision and from multiple angles. However, a survey in China indicated that most museums only use this technique as an auxiliary display, and have not fully utilize interactive techniques to exert the benefits of digital 3D simulation. Based on the theory of narratology, this study proposed a narrative conceptual framework with 12 elements by analyzing the narratological features of 3D reconstructed cultural relics, and used this narratological framework to plan and complete a 3D interactive design. Thus narratology was used as a design thinking of interactive design, changing the technology-oriented thinking habitually used in digital design. And the narrative mode of 3D interaction was also enriched through this study.},

  pages={69-78},
  abstract={Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is an essential hardware component in SDN-enabled switches, which supports fast lookup speed and flexible matching patterns. However, TCAM’s limited storage capacity has long been a scalability challenge to enforce fine-grained forwarding policies in SDN. Based on the observation of traffic locality, the rule-caching mechanism employs a combination of TCAM and Random Access Memory (RAM) to maintain the forwarding rules of large and small flows, respectively. However, previous works cannot identify large flows timely and accurately, and suffer from high computational complexity when addressing rule dependencies in TCAM. Worse still, TCAM only caches the forwarding rules of large flows but ignores the latency requirements of small flows. Small flows encounter cache-miss in TCAM and then will be diverted to RAM, where they have to experience slow lookup processes. To jointly optimize the performance of both high-throughput large flows and latency-sensitive small flows, we propose a hybrid rule-caching framework, H-Cache, to scale traffic-aware forwarding policies in SDN. H-Cache identifies large flows through a collaboration of learning-based and threshold-based methods to achieve early detection and high accuracy, and proposes a time-efficient greedy heuristic to address rule dependencies. For small flows, H-Cache establishes default paths in TCAM to speed up their lookup processes, and also reduces their TCAM occupancy through label switching and region partitioning. Experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that H-Cache increases TCAM utilization by an average of 11% and reduces the average completion time of small flows by almost 70%.},

  abstract={The potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to increase the productivity of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in developing countries has long been recognized. However, the realization of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavored to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SOEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SOEs listed under Privatization Commission is still in its infancy. It also identifies some significant barriers which are impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SOEs, and confidence on ICT of the SOEs in Bangladesh. This paper is based on the study conducted as part of the IDA funded Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project and explores the opportunities and barriers of using ICT to provide a necessary lever to enhance competitiveness and productivity of SOEs in Bangladesh.},

  abstract={Risk management could be seen as one of the important knowledge areas in the project management field that affects all the other areas in the project and also affect the success of the project as whole. In the recent years, Information Technology (IT) projects have become more complex as a result of the technological changes and the demand of having easy and flexible products, so it is important to give more focus to how the IT projects are managed. This research study aimed to study the link between implementing the project risk management activities and the success of the IT project in IT and Telecommunication sectors in Egypt. The success of the IT projects was measured using four dimensions: project time management (schedule), project cost management, project scope management and project quality management. The risk management activities contain the following: plan risk management, identify risks, perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk response, implement risk response, monitor risk. In order to achieve the objectives of this research, questionnaire was developed as a main instrument to collect the primary data. The questionnaire consisted of the following parts: the first part relates to background information; the second part relates to the project risk management and the third section relates to the project success. This study targeted the employees of IT project in Egypt, and 103 questionnaires were distributed to the study sample, and then SPSS was used to analyze the collected data. The results of this research showed that there is a positive impact for performing risk management activities on the IT project success and illustrate that implementing the risk management activities affect in a positive way the project success, and risk management should be considered as a one of the key activities that should be implemented in IT project and also should be considered as a one of the key factors that contribute to the IT project success.},

Developing countries suffer in terms of successful development projects due to a lack of transparency, poor information communication management, and many more that lead to poor project management. Blockchain applications aim to develop ecosystems that satisfy the high-security requirements of the users in enterprises such as finance, supply chain, and insurance which are more complex than the project management domain. This research reviewed several blockchain-based applications to fill this gap and identify the potential areas of blockchain systems in the project management field. Therefore, this paper first reviews the state-of-the-art blockchain use cases in project management to investigate the current status of blockchain applications in the domain of project management. Then presents an architecture based on the review results to guide researchers and developers in designing blockchain-based applications which are unique for the project management domain. The review reveals that blockchain technology has a wide range of unique functionalities and capabilities that contribute management of projects.

  abstract={Healthcare is an information and knowledge intensive industry where software systems are playing increasingly important roles. Thus the risks of harm are increasing. Previously, we have proposed a knowledge translation (KT) model to help bridge the gap between software engineering and clinicians. This paper highlights the application of our proposed knowledge translation loop. We have enacted it through a series of two studies: 1. A randomized control trial to evaluate a software-based decision support function in an electronic medical record (EMR) and 2. A lead user based user interface and safety design study to create an improved design for an EMR medication module. We also provide lessons learned and future directions on integrating our KT model in regular software quality management systems.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={72070-72087},
  abstract={Serious Games are games that aid in the process of training or learning content and skills. Numerous studies have reported the positive impact of serious games on the learning process for individuals with autism. However, many of these games do not utilize techniques known to be effective when teaching this specific audience, such as those based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers. Additionally, the GDD model provides characteristics that enable quantitative analysis of learning outcomes.},

  abstract={Data provenance is a basic requirement for trusted data management in the era of big data. Before the emergence of blockchain technology, data provenance mainly used a centralized database to store data records, log records, etc., to facilitate subsequent audit tracking, but database has the security problem of data tampering. After the emergence of blockchain technology, researchers have conducted a lot of research on trusted data provenance in the Internet of Things (IoT), product supply chain, medical health and other fields based on the characteristics of blockchain decentralization, tamper resistance, and traceability, etc., to ensure the security and trustworthiness of data provenance results. This paper will sort out the research on the use of blockchain technology for data provenance in different fields in recent years, and analyze the similarities and differences between existing blockchain based data provenance methods as a whole. Finally, the possible challenges in data provenance based on blockchain technology are pointed out and the possible solutions are given.},

  pages={176-181},
  abstract={While efficient email triage is a well-known problem, the currently used email filtering solutions are still rudimentary and machine centric. Most filtering solutions work best if humans add machine interpretable keywords to the subject line of emails. More natural filtering options, such as project membership lists or content-based filtering, are very time consuming to set up and maintain. Especially in research ecosystems, significant fluctuation in team members, organisations and projects themselves is common. Research projects are also usually managed in an ad-hoc manner, making static filtering rules a sub-optimal solution. In this paper we therefore introduce the Mind Mesh paradigm, a novel human-friendly information management approach. Based on a self-describing graph structure, organisational structures, projects, and collaborations are modelled. Leveraging this information, the system can automate and support administrative processes such as email filtering, based on an understanding of the project structures. It relieves users of the necessity to maintain machine interpretable rules by hand and adapts to new situations by itself.},

While Schön used both concepts, we show that Dewey's influence on Schön can explain why speaking of mediums as a “system of formation” can better describe the multilayered semiotic working of the material conversation either foregrounding the support and allowing for a bodily experience or foregrounding the message and supporting an interpreting experience.},

Therefore, this article rethinks the meaning and value of the term “vernacular design” in contemporary society, with a focus on vernacular graphic design. We argue that the domain needs an interpretation that is more attuned to novel approaches around hybridity and plurality in design. We frame this development from a theoretical perspective by introducing the concept of hypervernacular as a relational and plural approach. We ground our conceptual argument through a case study description that explores the everyday, ubiquitous, and more-than-human position of the plant species Japanese knotweed through collaboration.},

  abstract={To meet stakeholder non-technical background, requirements are often presented by analysts in terms of scenarios. While translating requirements into scenarios, details and over-specifications (called Ahab's Legs) need to be added to make requirements concrete and understandable to stakeholders. Despite the expected benefits that they should convey, Ahab's Legs could disturb the requirement validation session. They can, in fact, distract the attention of stakeholders. Valuable discussion time may be wasted when focusing on irrelevant details rather than on the actually relevant ones. In the present paper, we address the Ahab's Leg dilemma and its potential impact on requirement validation sessions. We discuss how to measure the distraction due to Ahab's Legs and what are the possible approaches an analyst can adopt to limit it. Moreover, we present the design of a controlled experiment devoted to measure the impact of Ahab's Legs on requirement validation sessions. In particular, the experiment is meant to (1) estimate the magnitude of the distracting effect, and to (2) assess one of the most promising way to alleviate their negative effect, i.e. by making stakeholder aware of the Ahab's Legs before the validation session.},

The study utilizes the ‘‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses’’ (PRISMA) framework to answer the following two research questions: (1) What are the state-of-the-art practices in business schools in terms of sustainability? (2) What digital tools are most commonly used to support sustainability-related learning concepts? Data was curated from the Web of Science Core Collection databases from the last five years. The initial search keywords included ‘‘Sustainability’’ + ‘‘Business Education’’ +$\prime\prime Technolog \mathrm{y}$” and yielded 1,477 scholarly works. However, after the PRISMA technique was employed, 286 scholarly sources were identified as eligible for the scope of the study. The findings highlight three main critical points: (1) gamitication techniques can enhance student learning outcomes in sustainability and, in particular, critical thinking; (2) e-platforms and other digital tools can support students’ sustainabilityrelated skills development while emphasizing the importance of sustainability; and (3) e-platforms and virtual pedagogical tools can generate a collaborative and integrated learning environment leading to community-centric mindset. Furthermore, the literature indicated that sustainability-related courses raised awareness of various socio-economic factions and changes in industrial structures toward environmentally friendly organizations and led to betterjob prospects.},

  abstract={In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating m-Health technology into the occupational therapists' established recovery processes. Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.},

From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment. Together, we propose they will allow scientists to concentrate on fundamental science rather than specifics of the underlying computing.},

  abstract={Exploiting inter-iteration data-level parallelism (DLP) is the important focus of many loop accelerators. Target at this, we propose a loop parallelization acceleration framework LoopPara, which follows a hardware/software coordinated pipeline: 1) an offline parallelism analysis is used to extract and encode application behavioral semantic of loop instructions as configuration. 2) a specialized loop accelerator loads the configuration for hardware mapping and guide the loop parallelism execution. Unlike traditional loop accelerators, LoopPara does not need instruction set architecture (ISA) extension, compiler modification, and software kernel replacement, which has better platform portability and can be easily integrated with general- propose processors with any ISA. Experiments show that, when coupling to an in-order RISC-V Rocket core, the LoopPara achieves 2.31x-5.42x (4. 17x on average) speedups, which out- performs other high-performance out-of-order BOOM cores.},

  pages={106485-106502},
  abstract={Extreme weather events, such as windstorms, hurricanes, and heat waves, exert a significant impact on global natural catastrophes and pose substantial challenges for weather forecasting systems. To enhance the accuracy and preparedness for extreme weather events, this study explores the potential of using expert crowdsourcing in storm forecasting research through the application of stigmergic collaboration. We present the development and implementation of an expert Crowdsourcing for Semantic Annotation of Atmospheric Phenomena (eCSAAP) system, designed to leverage the collective knowledge and experience of meteorological experts. Through a participatory co-creation process, we iteratively developed a web-based annotation tool capable of capturing multi-faceted insights from weather data and generating visualizations for expert crowdsourcing campaigns. In this context, this article investigates the intrinsic coordination among experts engaged in crowdsourcing tasks focused on the semantic annotation of extreme weather events. The study brings insights about the behavior of expert crowds by considering the cognitive biases and highlighting the impact of existing annotations on the quality of data gathered from the crowd and the collective knowledge generated. The insights regarding the crowdsourcing dynamics, particularly stigmergy, offer a promising starting point for utilizing stigmergic collaboration as an effective coordination mechanism for weather experts in crowdsourcing platforms but also in other domains requiring expertise-driven collective intelligence.},

The growing desire of organizations to design digital products and services with children in mind and reflects their existing rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) is supported by this standard. While different jurisdictions may have different laws and regulations in place, the best practice for designing digital services that impact directly or indirectly on children is offered by this standard. It sets out processes through the life cycle of development, delivery and distribution, that will help organizations ask the right relevant questions of their services, identify risks and opportunities by which to make their services age appropriate and take steps to mitigate risk and embed beneficial systems that support increased age appropriate engagement. One in three users online is under 18, which means that this standard has wide application.

  title={Development of 3D Modeling Parameter Design in Furniture Design},
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Today, with the rapid development of science and technology and information technology, virtual reality technology has become increasingly mature and popular, and is increasingly applied to the field of information multimedia display. Based on Web3D technology virtual reality display design, taking furniture display as an example, this paper analyzes the current 3D modeling virtual display, panoramic virtual display and other technologies using literature analysis and case analysis, and carries out application-oriented research based on the characteristics of virtual furniture display. The development of 3D modeling parametric design in furniture design has completely changed the way designers and manufacturers manufacture furniture. By using advanced software, designers can now create accurate and detailed 3D models for their designs, enabling them to visualize and improve their ideas before actual production. A key advantage of 3D modeling is that it allows designers to try different materials, colors, textures and finishes. They can also test various configurations, sizes and proportions until the desired results are achieved. This method saves the time and money of the physical prototype and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the final product. Another advantage is that parametric design allows more accuracy in designing complex geometry, which is difficult to achieve manually. Taking the furniture exhibition hall and the sofa in the model library as examples, this paper verifies the feasibility of the furniture display design based on panoramic technology and three-dimensional modeling technology. This study involves the production, dissemination, sales and other aspects of furniture products, provides a design fulcrum for the development of furniture display under the new economic conditions, and has very important practical significance for the healthy and sustainable development of the furniture industry.},

  abstract={Aiming at the demand characteristic of some arts and crafts whose styles change fast and life cycle is short, the relation between the product characteristic and the Kanzei knowledge of customer toward product was analyzed, and the model of Kanzei-driving product design knowledge base was constructed to support rapid product design. In the model, object-oriented method was used to construct product models. SML (tabular layouts of article characteristics) technology was utilized to express the general product features(style feature, function feature, geometrical feature, material feature, colour feature, technical feature and so on), and main model and SML-based standard design elements base were created to be chosen and variated in the design process. The Kanzei measure metrics of design elements was established, and Kanzei measures of every design elements and product model (combinations mode of the elements) were evaluated according to the aesthetic principle. With HOQ (house of quality), the customers’ requirements were converted to the Kanzei requirement for product model and the design elements. The similarity algorithm of characteristics vector space model was used search the optimized product model and standard design elements from the design knowledge base to form the concept sketch and main model of products, so that the final designs of products could be rapidly completed by designers. The application in a jewelry company indicated that the method reduced average cycle of jewelry development, and improved the efficiency of product design.},

  abstract={When the new generation of designers face more complex design issues, the form of design starts to shift, with the user centered concept continuously being accentuated and applied for problem-solving. The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users. It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.},

  abstract={This paper describes the development of Sahabat Vaksin, a web and mobile platform that aims to support willingness and timeliness in vaccinations in the community through delivery of relevant verifiable information. It is also aimed to help health workers and people of influence in the community increase their competence and confidence in countering anti vaccine narratives. Sahabat Vaksin was developed particularly for Indonesia to help mitigate the effects of anti vaccination narratives in the community. This sentiment has recently been aggravated by misinformation spread through social media and the internet. Most recently, vaccine rejections based on religious misconceptions on the permissibility of certain vaccines has been a key factor. This highlights the need to approach the issue through multiple lenses, going beyond the medical and scientific approaches. Sahabat Vaksin counters anti vaccine narratives through three main stakeholders. First, we equip midwives with adaptive counter messages that will help them deliver information to counter anti-vaccination arguments, touching on both health based as well as religious based counter-arguments, second we provide mothers with short, easy to understand information on vaccination, as well as customized, timely messages based on pregnancy stage or child age and perception towards vaccination, and (iii) we engage local religious leaders and actors to develop and spread their narrative in supporting timely vaccination, including equipping them with appropriate medical and technical knowledge to complement their religious knowledge.},

  abstract={Nonverbal vocalizations from non- and minimally speaking individuals who speak fewer than 20 words (mv* individuals) convey important communicative and affective information. While nonverbal vocalizations that occur amidst typical speech and infant vocalizations have been studied extensively in the literature, there is limited prior work on vocalizations by mv* individuals. Our work is among the first studies of the communicative and affective information expressed in nonverbal vocalizations by mv* children and adults. We collected labeled vocalizations in real-world settings with eight mv* communicators, with communicative and affective labels provided in-the-moment by a close family member. Using evaluation strategies suitable for messy, real-world data, we show that nonverbal vocalizations can be classified by function (with 4- and 5-way classifications) with F1 scores above chance for all participants. We analyze labeling and data collection practices for each participating family, and discuss the classification results in the context of our novel real-world data collection protocol. The presented work includes results from the largest classification experiments with nonverbal vocalizations from mv* communicators to date.},

  pages={82-87},
  abstract={Small and medium-sized businesses or known as SMEs are essential contributors in the software industry. Software Requirement Engineering (SRE) process is an essential part of the software development life cycle. With the advent of technology, the software has become necessary component of business, especially with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Due to this many challenges faced by IT SMEs in adoption of SRE for successful completion of projects. There have been many factors affecting the progress of SMEs among which few are reported in this SLR. A total of 40 studies are found which are relevant to the research questions and published between 2010 and 2023. The research highlights that SMEs face significant challenges when implementing effective SRE processes due to a lack of resources, experience, and tools. However, the studies propose various solutions to address these challenges, including Agile methodologies, communication enhancement, collaboration among stakeholders, and tools to support SRE processes. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the human elements of SRE, such as team dynamics, training, and motivation, and suggests that SMEs should establish specialized SRE processes that fit their requirements and resources. The article concludes that more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of SRE practices in SMEs and to provide guidelines and frameworks for improving SRE processes in this significant segment of the software industry. Overall, the research provides helpful insights into the current state of SRE practices in SMEs and highlights the potential for enhancing SRE procedures in this sector.},

This KT is very suitable for general parts library development, because it can easily provide the product information, control parts size or model shape, and regulate the topology structure of an assembly. An applied case is proposed by taking hanger frame design of the supercritical boiler as an example to validate the general parts library. The KT for hanger design contains all the information of the general part manual. It can also be easily loaded into the totality design of hanger frame. This method meets the needs of constant revision of hanger frame and the design cycle is shortened greatly.},

  pages={4772-4778},
  abstract={In this article, an intelligent multifield collaborative optimization method of a through silicon via (TSV) array with performance constraints is proposed. The multiphysical field-coupled cosimulation of the TSV array is carried out using COMSOL and ANSYS, and the effects of design parameters (radius, oxide thickness, pitch, offset angle, and height) on the performance (electrical, thermal, stress, and area) of the TSV array are analyzed. The mapping relationship between the design and performance parameters is established by a neural network. A collaborative optimization strategy with performance constraints is proposed, and the design parameters are optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. According to the optimized design parameters, the simulation results of the finite-element method (FEM) are basically consistent with the predicted performance. The maximum deviation between simulation verification and optimization results is 3.04%, and the proposed method reduces the search time by 99.52% and computation time by 83.86% compared to traditional methods, respectively.},

  abstract={The rise in the incidence of global pandemics and climate catastrophes demonstrates that the demand for healthcare services is stretched beyond what services can be effectively provided. Even with increased healthcare spending in recent years in the United States and worldwide, access to healthcare resources has declined for many. To improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare solutions to meet this increasing demand and increase patient self-efficacy, connected healthcare solutions, including hospital-at-home, are being introduced. Many limitations exist for hospital-at-home models, including policy gaps, technological gaps, and issues patients face specific to their health outcomes. To overcome these limitations, a transdisciplinary framework for hospital-at-home is presented in this white paper. Barriers to the implementation of this framework are discussed, including healthcare worker burnout and the impact on the social determinants of health. Potential extensions to the transdisciplinary framework beyond hospital-at-home are also presented.},

  abstract={Through knowledge extraction from data with various methods, Data Science (DS) allows organizations to achieve improvements in performance. The execution of these projects is mainly supported by DS process models such as CRISP-DM. As a high percentage of DS undertakings are failing, revisions to current DS project management practices become necessary. Amongst others, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and knowledge retention across the project present important success factors in DS projects. Some of the DS process models feature documentation artifacts for this purpose but not comprehensively for the complete DS lifecycle. Accordingly, in this research, existing documentation deliverables for DS are identified and examined by means of a literature review. Based on the established best practices from the process models, the contents of 18 derived project artifacts for DS documentation are synthesized for the DS lifecycle to improve DS project management.},

  title={Designing AI Using a Human-Centered Approach: Explainability and Accuracy Toward Trustworthiness},
  year={2023},
  volume={4},
  number={1},
  pages={9-23},
  abstract={One of the major criticisms of Artificial Intelligence is its lack of explainability. A claim is made by many critics that without knowing how an AI may derive a result or come to a given conclusion, it is impossible to trust in its outcomes. This problem is especially concerning when AI-based systems and applications fail to perform their tasks successfully. In this Special Issue Editorial, we focus on two main areas, explainable AI (XAI) and accuracy, and how both dimensions are critical to building trustworthy systems. We review prominent XAI design themes, leading to a reframing of the design and development effort that highlights the significance of the human, thereby demonstrating the importance of human-centered AI (HCAI). The HCAI approach advocates for a range of deliberate design-related decisions, such as those pertaining to multi-stakeholder engagement and the dissolving of disciplinary boundaries. This enables the consideration and integration of deep interdisciplinary knowledge, as evidenced in our example of social cognitive approaches to AI design. This Editorial then presents a discussion on ways forward, underscoring the value of a balanced approach to assessing the opportunities, risks and responsibilities associated with AI design. We conclude by presenting papers in the Special Issue and their contribution, pointing to future research endeavors.},

  abstract={While humans share many physical characteristics, they are not replicas of one another in appearance. Despite their uniqueness, common features mean that comparisons can be made. The ability to identify someone by face has been one of the most fundamental ways that humans have connected with each other as distinct persons [1]. Recognizing someone is in fact a form of human visual information processing [2]. Long before mirrors were available in the ancient world (circa 5th century BCE the Greeks used hand mirrors for grooming [3]), descriptions of one’s face were always determined by another’s gaze or at best one’s own description of their reflection in clean water illuminated by sunlight. Some even gained nicknames through the identification of distinct features on their forehead, nose, eyes, eyebrows, ears, and cheeks, for example, or through some clear markings, such as freckles or a birthmark. These were all the usual ways of remembering individuals; not as a means of discrimination but simply for the purposes of identification. In villages that did not exceed 250 households, it was possible to know of, and remember everyone [4], especially given that relations possessed similar and familial features.},

By the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, he noticed an obvious shift in the reason for invention: from necessity to that of the special interest of the state. By the 19th century again, the reason for invention changed to that of the special interest of the bourgeoisie who could see the profits that could be generated by the deliberate development of a technique. Since about the 1600s people have invested their money in stock in order to receive dividends; this practice became particularly attractive in the 20th century.},

  abstract={Sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications and networks will continue to move to higher frequency and wider bandwidth, with much higher data rate and spectral efficiency. Given the heterogeneity and densification of Internet of Things (IoT), 6G wireless network may need to be extended to modern random access (RA) for IoT applications, which can be achieved via smart protocol design and advanced signal processing and communications technologies. The modern RA techniques, such as massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO), OFDMA, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), sparse signal processing, or new orthogonal design techniques provide good candidacy for 6G-enabled IoT. In 6G, grant-free transmission should be designed for distributed IoT applications. IoT applications are often involved in self-organizing decision making. 6G-enabled IoT will take advantage of the recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. It will generate new knowledge and understanding and accelerate discovery and innovation in IoT. Each of these efforts is designed to amplify the intrinsically multidisciplinary nature of the emerging field of IoT. The 6G-enabled IoT will establish theoretical, technical, and ethical frameworks that will be applied to tackle many challenges in IoT, advancing technology for humanity.},

  abstract={Communication systems deployed in harsh environments, such as high-speed trains, subways, deserts, trenches, forests, and underground mines, should be specially constructed to withstand extreme conditions such as high or low temperatures, corrosive humidity, extreme weather, or excessive dust and dirt. Such applications require specially designed wireless communication, fiber-optic communications, satellite communication, or signal processing techniques that can perform under extreme conditions and meet the QoS, security, and reliability requirements. Quite often, communications in harsh environments have an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high Doppler shift, and long latency, and often consume more power and energy. Bandwidth limitation in harsh environments requires spectrum efficient communications. The current state of art technologies such as massive MIMO, advanced modulation and channel coding, artificial intelligence, and signal processing provide different venues to explore this challenging area.},

  abstract={The future generation of smart cities is a very timely and attractive topic for the research community worldwide. The evolution of this generation is oriented toward providing innovative services and policymaking to guarantee the well-being of citizens. Research on smart cities is maturing and the question of securing the well-being of cities’ inhabitants is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Considering the challenges and opportunities cities/urban spaces generate, today the imperative is to examine how targeted research and cutting-edge innovation can be effectively communicated to all stakeholders. Thus, synergies emerging at the researchinnovation- policymaking nexus can be exploited and city dwellers’ well-being can be enhanced. Pervasive computing, big data analytics, crowdsourcing, and other timely technologies, including user behavior, brand popularity, recommender systems, and social media analytics, bear the promise and potential that viable solutions to key problems and challenges specific to the future generation of smart cities will be found. The objective of this Special Section in IEEE ACCESS is to examine this promise and potential from a variety of complementary interdisciplinary perspectives, including computing/ ICT, political economy, public policy, innovation, and entrepreneurship.},

  abstract={Briefing: With the rapid development of information technologies such as digital twin, extended reality, and blockchain, the hype around “metaverse” is increasing at astronomical speed. However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.},

THE slogan for IEEE is "Advancing Technology for Humanity".Implied within that slogan is the purpose of technology is for social good. Thus, this special issue falls within the spirit of the IEEE. The United Nations has been supporting social good with various goals, initially the millennium goals which evolved to the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The SDGs represent 17 major goals covering the three major dimensions of sustainability—environmental, social, and economic goals. The linkages between the SDGs and Industry 4.0 technologies— the latest classification of production technologies— have shown some SDG benefits from these technologies. The importance of social issues and social good is not lost on recent works on technology management. Yet, although the SDGs are about a decade old—they are only just appearing in the technology management and related topics literature. },

  abstract={Welcome to the WICSA, QoSA, and CBSE 2016 conferences. While we had separate calls for papers, separate chairs and review processes for each conference, we had a unified, stronger community with a joint program committee. Even though the proceedings separate the papers in distinct chapters for each conference, there is a single conference program designed jointly by the program chairs of the three conferences. More precisely, papers accepted separately by the WICSA 2016, QoSA 2016, and CBSE 2016 conferences will be presented together in shared sessions. Hence, this year’s event is a great opportunity to bring together the researchers from the WICSA, QoSA and CBSE conference series. This year, WICSA, QoSA and CBSE calls for papers have attracted 149 submissions in total. Papers submitted to either WICSA, QoSA or CBSE were evaluated separately for each conference. After a careful evaluation by at least three reviewers and a following discussion period, 30 papers were accepted from WICSA, 12 from QoSA and 14 from CBSE. During the technical sessions, conference attendees will have the opportunity to listen to 56 presentations in 18 shared sessions. Some of these sessions will be working sessions with time slots dedicated to extended open discussions. In their calls for papers WICSA, QoSA, and CBSE addressed key concerns of software architectures across the system life cycle, such as designing for longevity, designing for reliability, and designing for flexibility. When we allocated the accepted papers to presentations sessions, it became evident that these concerns were shared by the three conferences. Hence the sessions were assembled to focus on these concerns.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators. It should be especially informative for oversight and governance organizations providing auditing and performance evaluations.},
