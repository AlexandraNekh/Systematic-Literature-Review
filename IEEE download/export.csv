Work on the introduction of intelligent transport systems is being carried out all over the world, because the improvement of the road network is an important element in creating comfortable conditions for the movement of people in an urbanized environment; a tool for improving road safety. Based on interdisciplinary research methods in the framework of urban planning, the paper proposes a methodology for assessing the prospects for the development of an intelligent city transport system within the framework of the concept of participatory design. The formation of the transport system is seen as a process of coordination of institutional and civil needs. The goal of the joint work of urban planners and civil society is to improve the safety of road infrastructure, not only through the development and implementation of quality standards, but also through the internalization (recognition) of the value of new technologies by the society. It is necessary to introduce the principles of participatory design of the transport system into the development of the road network, the urban space should remain free for co-creation. The problem of the study is that technologies for improving road safety, including the use of artificial intelligence, automation systems for traffic management processes depending on the rhythm of the city, weather conditions, time of day (traffic flow detectors, CCTV cameras, ""smart traffic lights"", weather stations, vehicle traffic sensors, navigation information systems, weather information display systems, environmental pollution sensors, traffic control centers, etc.) can be perceived by citizens primarily as devices that restrict freedom of movement, and not as means of improving road safety","2768-0118","979-8-3503-9772-7","10.1109/IEEECONF56737.2023.10091968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091968","intelligent transport system;participatory design;assessment methodology;road safety","Urban areas;Sociology;Market research;Road safety;Sensor systems;Safety;Security","artificial intelligence;intelligent transportation systems;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;smart cities;town and country planning;traffic engineering computing","artificial intelligence;automation systems;CCTV cameras;digitalization process;environmental pollution sensors;intelligent city transport system;navigation information systems;participatory design;quality standards;road infrastructure;road network;road safety;road systems;smart traffic lights;traffic control centers;traffic flow detectors;traffic management processes;urban planning;urban space;urbanized environment;vehicle traffic sensors;weather information display systems;weather stations","","","","18","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clinicians are inundated with new types of data to synthesize in a timely manner to make a clinical decisions about the care of their patients. The overwhelming abundance of data leads to physician burnout, which is a major problem within healthcare. In parallel, there is an immense hype building up about implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, to augment clinician decision making processes. Healthcare is a highly regulated environment so it's imperative to involve clinicians and data scientists in the entire model development, validation and implementation lifecycle. There ought to be a mechanism in place for integration of human feedback to build trust in the AI model, through human in the loop implementation models and participatory design approaches. The overarching aim of this stury is to formulate a problem statement and propose the development a system dynamics model highlighting the feedback loops within clinical decision-making workflows leading to diffusion of innovation of AI within healthcare.

Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a framework for dual fusion of knowledge data in co-design based on blockchain and ontology methods. Firstly, the ontology method is used to establish the framework for knowledge unification, and the knowledge and concepts in the design and manufacturing fields are unified so as to realize the purpose of concept unification and meet the needs of efficient communication. Secondly, the blockchain method is used to establish the data management system. Through signing the smart contract, the use authority of the data involved is limited, so as to realize the data fusion in the co-design process.

Developers have the capabilities to program robots but often lack insights possessed by domain experts, sometimes leading to technically interesting but impractical systems. With this workshop, we aim to bridge two different methods often used individually within the wider HRI community to involve end users in robot program design: Participatory Design (PD) and End-User Programming (EUP). Both methods empower end users to co-produce robots addressing real-world needs. However, there have been limited opportunities to unite researchers who specialize in these areas and engage in mutual learning. We will address this shortcoming with a full-day workshop, which will put the PD and EUP communities in touch, inviting speakers from both sides and welcoming a wide range of publications from describing new end-user programming methods to compiling insights learned from conducting participatory design studies.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889648","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1925043); NASA(grant numbers:80NSSC19M0124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889648","End-User Programming;Human-Robot Inter-action;Personalization;Participatory Design","Bridges;Conferences;Programming;Robots","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);robot programming","human-robot interaction;robot program design;HRI;end-user programming;participatory design;system design;PD;EUP","","","","0","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This acknowledgment reinforces the prevailing thought from the U.S. Army Combat Capability Development Command Armaments Center (DEVCOM AC) that there are robust processes in place to mitigate risks, such as the Army Materiel Release (MR) process, but the key is how to tailor them to ensure continued application.The Materiel Release process, which ensure systems are safe, suitable, and supportable, as written may be a challenging process to adhere to by AI-enabled projects. There are facets of the AI technology that currently make it difficult to proceed through the process. The authors spent years engaged with MR stakeholders, board members, coordinator, and chair to identify the prevailing concerns, risks, and proposed mitigations, which eventually formed into a roadmap to properly and thoroughly review an AI enabled system.

Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles.

But the conflict appears in the process of design which may interface the design. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a good method for conflict resolution, which has been applied in the artificial intelligence field successfully. However, due to the uncertainties in knowledge representation, attribute description, and similarity measures of CBR, it is very difficult to find the similar cases from case database. To solve the problem of conflict resolution in collaborative design, a fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. The process of fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is introduced. Based on the feature attributes and their relative weights determined by a fuzzy technique, a fuzzy CBR retrieving mechanism is developed to retrieve conflict resolution cases that tend to enhance the functions of the database. The theory and methods of fuzzy CBR is applied to define the cases. By indexing, calculating the weight and defuzzication of the cases, the case similarity can be obtained. Then the case consistency is measured to keep the result right. Finally, the method is demonstrated availably for conflict resolution by means of a case study.","2154-963X","978-0-7695-3290-5","10.1109/CCCM.2008.334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609680","collaborative design;conflict resolution;case-based reasoning (CBR);fuzzy;retrieve","Cognition;Databases;Collaboration;Artificial neural networks;Product design;Mathematical model;Expert systems","CAD;case-based reasoning;fuzzy reasoning;groupware;knowledge representation;mechanical engineering computing","fuzzy case-based reasoning;conflict resolution;collaborative design;CBR;artificial intelligence field;knowledge representation;attribute description;cases defuzzication;design process","","4","","15","IEEE","29 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differences of background, culture and expertise usually lead to conflicting situations. Moreover, if we consider to be working on a synchronous environment — where all designers exchange data and share information at the same time that the product design is being done — potential knowledge representation conflicts can also arise from this process. In our work we currently represent knowledge in collaborative design by using Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is structured to be a major formalism for the design and dissemination of ontology information. The use of OWL reasoning is intended to be a consistent way to verify the information given by several experts, trying to avoid redundancies, contradictions and misunderstood. This paper presents an approach to detect collaborative design conflicts through the use of an OWL inference engine.","","978-0-85358-244-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462092","Collaborative design;conflicts;ontologies;reasoning","OWL;Ontologies;Collaboration;Engines;Connectors;Resource description framework;Semantics","inference mechanisms;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);product design;production engineering computing","multidisciplinary virtual team Integration;collaborative design process;synchronous environment;data exchange;information share;product design;knowledge representation conflict detection;Web Ontology Language;ontology information dissemination;ontology information design;OWL reasoning;OWL inference engine","","","2","21","","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People living with dementia often continue to live at home and are supported by caregivers and next of kin. It is often important to monitor the wellbeing of people living with dementia in order to measure their level of independence and to provide proper support at the time of need as well as supporting their quality of life. Some researchers have focused on monitoring physical wellbeing and activities of daily living (ADL). However, there has been a paucity of research focussed on monitoring mood, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia, despite these people experiencing frustration, agitation, depression and social isolation to name but a few known effects. As a result, the SenseCare project aims to build an affective computing platform that uses sensors placed in the home environment to monitor moods, affect and the emotional wellbeing of people living with dementia. This platform is being iteratively designed and will likely use plug-n-play sensors such as passive infrared, wearables and camera technologies to infer emotions from facial expressions, voice intonations and physical behaviour and other modalities. However, it is important to interact iteratively with people living with dementia and their caregivers in order to understand their profound needs. In this study, we report on two focus groups that were conducted to elicit user stories and eventual requirements for the SenseCare platform. Since participatory design involving people living with dementia could bring about unique challenges, we adopted a dyad approach where a caregiver and the person living with dementia participate together in the focus group. This ensures that their needs are fully represented and that consent is fully transparent. In this paper, we report the personal stories elicited during these discussions which will ultimately inform the implementation of the SenseCare platform.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217972","affective computing;people living with dementia;emotional wellbeing;participatory design","Dementia;Mood;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors;Sociology;Statistics","assisted living;diseases;health care;Internet;medical computing","participatory design;dementia;emotional wellbeing;SenseCare platform;activities of daily living;requirements elicitation;physical wellbeing monitoring;dyad approach","","5","","4","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We posit that engaging young children to co-invent and make concrete prototypes improves their ideas, encourages them to become active participants, and allows them to establish the implications of the technology in their everyday lives. In order to lay the foundation for middle school ML education, we collaboratively designed and prototyped ML applications with 43 eighth grade students (ages 11 to 14) in a Nigerian school. The ideas generated by the students indicate that they began to identify the applicability of ML to their daily lives and as a solution to a plethora of societal challenges.

The study discusses various smart initiatives of top three ranked smart cities (London, Singapore & Seoul) by the smart government and the user experience. However research still fall short to understand the success of participatory design in use of smart concepts and the smart knowledge in day-to-day life. Policy makers and practitioners both need to deal with these progressive developments and digital connections.

The existing out of band network telemetry technology will transmit additional probes to measure the network status, which will inevitably lead to the ""observer"" effect, leading to inaccurate measurement information. In addition, it is difficult to describe the relationship between complex network states and routing optimization strategies with accurate mathematical models. Let some neurons stop working temporarily, reduce the interaction between neurons, implicitly delete neurons in the network, and prevent some functional synergies to alleviate excessive matching. The algorithm selects temporarily discarded neurons with random probability, while the optimization algorithm uses Ising model in machine learning data to identify neurons with low link energy, and temporarily discards these neurons in training and reasoning. This algorithm makes the model more general and effectively alleviates the over fitting problem of network training. Its purpose is to select key features closely related to the learning purpose or eliminate irrelevant features to improve the performance of the model. Feature sparse methods can be divided into two categories. And in machine learning, the use of control algorithms can effectively improve the development of machine learning, and in machine learning, the proportion of optimization using control algorithms is very large. This paper puts forward many new ideas, hoping to improve the use of machine learning control algorithm.","","979-8-3503-1331-4","10.1109/ICNETIC59568.2023.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236840","Machine learning;Memory database;Control algorithm optimization","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Neurons;Machine learning;Tunneling;Virtual machining","complex networks;concurrency control;database management systems;Ising model;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;probability;telemetry","accurate mathematical models;additional probes;band network telemetry technology;complex network states;concurrency control algorithm;genrating routing optimization strategies;implicitly delete neurons;inaccurate measurement information;machine learning control algorithm;machine learning data;main memory database;network status;network training;observer effect;omplex network states;optimization algorithm;optimization design;random probability;real-time network measurement","","","","10","IEEE","6 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While previous research predominantly focuses on a particular aspect of design knowledge, an integrated method is required to develop such systems especially in the context that the amount of data has become huge. To address such a gap, this work aims to address the two views of design knowledge, namely codification and personalisation. The main idea is to facilitate the collaborative design process with a model-based solution which uses computational methods based on codified knowledge while incorporating rich personal experience of problem-solving for decision-making. This solution requires an effective knowledge representation that facilitates the integration of explicit and tacit knowledge in the computational processes. In addition, it relies on effective system integration during these processes. This paper reports the very first step towards such a solution, describing the system integration issues and the user interaction issues in the development of a prototype system.","","978-1-5090-1915-1","10.1109/CSCWD.2016.7566056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7566056","collaborative design;knowledge-based engineering;knowledge and experience;system integration;scalability","Decision support systems;System integration;Decision making;Collaboration;Prototypes;Knowledge based systems;Context","decision making;design engineering;knowledge based systems;knowledge representation","codification integration;knowledge personalisation views;collaborative design;decision making;complex analysis streamlining;synthesis processes;knowledge representation;system integration","","2","","12","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has demonstrated significant success in dealing with various complex problems, and shows capabilities close to humans or even beyond humans. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions.

AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity influence and are affected by various stakeholders possessing a variety of knowledge and expertise in respective areas. To fill this context specific gap, this study investigates the direct relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, this study examines the mediating role of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity and moderating effect of stakeholders involvement on the relationship between AI, e-Governance, and cybersecurity. The results of PLS-SEM path modeling analysis revealed a partial mediating impact of e-Governance between AI and cybersecurity. Likewise, moderating influence of stakeholders involvement was discovered on the relationship between AI and e-Governance, as well as between e-Governance and cybersecurity.

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are respected, medical machine learning systems must be developed responsibly. Many high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations—albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations, model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge, the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3178382","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) through the AI Space for Intelligent Health Systems (KI-SIGS) Project; several universities, research institutions, and private companies in northern Germany; Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Hamburg (by paying the open access fees); KI-SIGS Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9783196","Algorithmic fairness;ethical machine learning;explainability;medical device regulation;medical machine learning;privacy;reliability;robustness;safety;security;transparency","Machine learning;Regulation;Ethics;Artificial intelligence;Medical diagnostic imaging;Privacy;Medical services","data privacy;ethical aspects;health care;law;learning (artificial intelligence)","existing regulations;medical context;federated learning;responsible regulatory conform machine learning;medical care;medical machine learning systems","","3","","436","CCBY","27 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas reasons for adopting DevOps are often described in terms of operational efficiency, the paper at hand aims to investigate whether implementing DevOps can additionally contribute to the strategic advantage of companies. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review of 37 empirical research papers on DevOps capabilities and analyzed the results in the context of the dynamic capabilities theory. Our conceptual model proposes that DevOps teams can contribute to firm competitive advantage by building both business- and technology-related capabilities which enable them to sense market opportunities, make fast and targeted decisions and transform their assets in case of changing circumstances. This research aims to generate a deeper understanding of the impact which software delivery approaches like DevOps can have on firm competitive advantage and provides insight into the sources of dynamic capabilities in modern IT organizations.","2378-1971","978-1-6654-2069-3","10.1109/CBI52690.2021.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610667","DevOps;dynamic capabilities;IT capabilities;firm competitive advantage","Systematics;Conferences;Bibliographies;Buildings;Collaboration;Transforms;Companies","competitive intelligence;decision making;software prototyping;team working","operational efficiency;dynamic capabilities theory;DevOps teams;technology-related capabilities;DevOps capabilities;cross-functional teams;agile software delivery;team autonomy;firm competitive advantage;IT development;business-related capabilities;decision making;IT organizations","","5","","64","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a recognition that AI offers immense potential for improving human well-being, which has been formulated at length from many perspectives, including the economic, social, psychological, developmental, and health perspectives. Critical questions with regards to these AI for well-being systems are, “What does success as far as employing AI to support human well-being look like?” and perhaps more importantly, “How do we inform system development processes to ensure the said success?” AI ethical frameworks and design guidelines have been formulated that address these questions by articulating some notion of successful or desired AI. Further, approaches such as participatory design, value-sensitive design, and goal-oriented requirements engineering aim to connect system development processes with high-level contextual concerns and non-functional softgoals. However, to establish the effectiveness of these instruments for informing AI for well-being solutions, it is necessary to have normative analysis and evaluation frameworks that recognize the innate complexity and multidimensionality of human well-being. This paper presents Herman Dooyeweerd's philosophy as one such framework and provides a formulation of well-being informed by his Theory of Aspects and his “simultaneous realization of norms” principle. The paper then presents a multi-aspectual analysis of AI Ethics frameworks to illustrate and suggest a mechanism that can be employed across diverse contexts and domains for requirement analysis and requirements refinement for technology solutions in general, but specifically for AI for well-being solutions.","","978-1-7281-8354-1","10.1109/REWBAH51211.2020.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216064","Multi-Aspectual Analysis;Requirements Analysis;Goal Analysis;Artificial Intelligence and Ethics;Well-being","Artificial intelligence;Economics;Psychology;Instruments;Complexity theory;Technological innovation;Extraterrestrial measurements","artificial intelligence;ethical aspects;formal specification;formal verification;systems analysis","human well-being;AI ethics frameworks;developmental health perspectives;high-level contextual concerns;goal-oriented requirements engineering;value-sensitive design;participatory design;system development processes;psychological health perspectives;social health perspectives;economic health perspectives;artificial intelligence;multiaspectual requirements analysis","","1","","46","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tools are (a) a formal specification for a class of multimedia games, (b) a game-building tool called PRIME Designer, and (c) a game engine that brings games to life. The design of these tools addresses several issues: (1) support for a common language for the design process, deriving from state-space search, (2) visual interfaces for collaboration, (3) specifications for a class of games (called PRIME games) whose affordances represent a balance between simplicity and richness, (4) educating students to work in design teams that use advanced computational services, and (5) assessing the learning and contributions of each team member. We also report on a focus group study in which four undergraduate students used the tools. Our experience suggests that users without a computing background can learn how to employ state-space trees to organize the design process, and thereby gain facilities to coordinate their individual contributions to the design of a game.","2325-4289","978-1-4244-4814-2","10.1109/CIG.2009.5286489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286489","","Collaboration;Process design;Design methodology;Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence;Formal specifications;Engines;Collaborative tools;Collaborative work;Computer interfaces","artificial intelligence;computer games;formal specification;groupware;human computer interaction;multimedia systems;problem solving","game-building environment;collaborative design;telecommunications;human-computer interfaces;problem solving;artificial intelligence;formal specification;multimedia games;PRIME designer;game engine","","2","","13","IEEE","13 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way.

While participatory design has been applied to some affective technologies, the technical and algorithmic complexity of those based on semi-intelligent information filters (SIIFs) pose distinct challenges. Coincidentally, these technologies raise important and distinct ethical issues that make stakeholder input critical during product design. We present a framework for fostering genuine engagement from stakeholders through the case example of biomusic - a SIIF-based affective technology that translates emotion-related physiological changes into sound. During a 3-day workshop, ethnographic methods were used to collect data about the interface between biomusic and individuals on the autism spectrum. From these data, emergent themes, such as such as privacy, data security, conceptions of assistive technology and representation of emotions were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. In order to illuminate distinct design decisions implicated by these complex and interwoven ethical issues, we propose a design framework consisting of a technological, a human-centered and an ecological lens. This framework and recommendations provide a concrete praxis for engaging stakeholders in the complex issues associated with the design of SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2922911","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:611-2016-0342); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8738864","Affective technology;semi-intelligent information filters;participatory design;ethics","Stakeholders;Conferences;Autism;Physiology;Affective computing;Skin;Feature extraction","computer aided instruction;emotion recognition;ethical aspects;groupware;human computer interaction;human factors;physiology;product design;user interfaces","SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems;participatory design;interfacing biomusic;user-centered;stakeholders;technical complexity;algorithmic complexity;semiintelligent information filters;distinct challenges;stakeholder input;product design;SIIF-based affective technology;emotion-related physiological changes;assistive technology;distinct design decisions;complex issues;interwoven ethical issues;design framework","","3","","46","IEEE","18 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To face this situation different regulations and solutions, to help users get in control over their data, emerged. However, many of the solutions require a certain level of knowledge in the field of privacy or offer unclear information that does not facilitate a real control of their data by the users. Added to this is the unfriendly user interface design as one of the factors that prevents users from managing their privacy settings effectively. Thus, in this work we explore the effect of the application of Participatory Design (PD) techniques in the implementation of privacy enhancing technologies. In particular, we focus on the use of PD for the design of a privacy dashboard that encourages the immersion of users with privacy issues and gives them greater control with a user interface according to usability criteria. The evaluation of the PD process, which has resulted in a high-fidelity prototype of the dashboard, shows encouraging results and greater user immersion in privacy management.","","978-1-6654-9503-5","10.1109/CLEI53233.2021.9640155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640155","privacy;dashboard;participatory design","Privacy;Conferences;Art;Software;Law;Human computer interaction;Usability","data privacy;user interfaces","privacy dashboard;academic environment;data manipulation;user interface design;participatory design techniques;privacy enhancing technologies;user immersion;privacy management;usability criteria;high-fidelity prototype","","","","","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Government of Canada predicts that in the year 2030, over 9.5 million (23%) Canadians will be 65 years or older. For this growing demographic of older adults, intelligent home health technologies have been proposed as one beneficial avenue to support and maintain an individual’s health and wellness as they begin experiencing aging-related health effects. However, many ethical concerns have been raised regarding the design and deployment of intelligent home healthcare technologies in aging- in-place settings such as long-term care and nursing homes. This paper presents a revised participatory design methodology to identify aging-in-place stakeholders’ ethical concerns with two Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) devices. The main objective of this paper is to develop and test a participatory design research method that is well suited for older adults living in long-term care settings, which is currently lacking. Developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers and social science researchers, this paper presents the participatory method that was designed and tested in a long-term care facility by collaborating with a mix of aging-in-place stakeholders, including older adults and healthcare professionals.

Despite these successes, one of the biggest challenges to widespread deployment of such object detection networks on edge and mobile scenarios is the high computational and memory requirements. As such, there has been growing research interest in the design of efficient deep neural network architectures catered for edge and mobile usage. In this study, we introduce YOLO Nano, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of object detection. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create YOLO Nano, where principled network design prototyping, based on design principles from the YOLO family of single-shot object detection network architectures, is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create a compact network with highly customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task of embedded object detection. The proposed YOLO Nano possesses a model size of ~4.0MB (>15.1× and >8.3× smaller than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) and requires 4.57B operations for inference (>34% and ~17% lower than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) while still achieving an mAP of ~69.1% on the VOC 2007 dataset (~12% and ~10.7% higher than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively). Experiments on inference speed and power efficiency on a Jetson AGX Xavier embedded module at different power budgets further demonstrate the efficacy of YOLO Nano for embedded scenarios.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463524","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Microarchitecture;Image edge detection;Neural networks;Memory management;Object detection;Machine learning;Network architecture","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;object detection","high computational memory requirements;efficient deep neural network architectures;YOLO Nano;highly compact deep convolutional neural network;object detection networks;deep convolutional neural networks;Tiny YOLOv3;Tiny YOLOv2;embedded object detection;microarchitecture designs;highly customized module-level macroarchitecture;machine-driven design exploration;single-shot object detection network architectures;design principles;principled network design prototyping;human-machine collaborative design strategy","","46","","23","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of various international regulatory bodies like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), has also been intentional in encouraging companies to disclose publicly documents like annual reports, integrated reports in regards to topics like social, environmental, employee affairs and human rights. When it comes to investing, ESG issues take into account a firm’s operational influence on the native environment. Customers, policy makers, investors, and regulators are exerting huge amount of pressure on Companies to carry out Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"") reporting also known as non-financial reporting. Sustainability reporting has previously exhibited numerous advantages to businesses as accurate data collection and reporting are essential for managing the company’s sustainability performance as well as improving financial decision making. It is vital for a company’s long-term performance to actively disclose and communicate its non-financial practices and approaches. Therefore, in order to answer questions like; “Is it vital for developing market firms to disclose non-financial information, such as that relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG)?”, this paper will attempt to provide a deeper insight into ESG disclosure and the impact it has on Firm Performance using Machine Learning techniques (Regression) and performance Ratios (Return On Assets & Return On Equity).","","978-1-6654-8425-1","10.1109/ICEARS53579.2022.9752343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9752343","Machine Learning;ESG Disclosure;Firm Performance;Emerging Markets;Financial Ratios (Return On Assets;Return On Equity)","Renewable energy sources;Regulators;Decision making;Machine learning;Companies;Data collection;Pressure measurement","company reports;corporate social responsibility;decision making;financial management;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;sustainable development","incorporating ESG;Machine Learning;reporting environmental, social,;massive shift;overwhelming demand;international regulatory bodies;Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive;publicly documents;annual reports;integrated reports;social employee affairs;environmental employee affairs;human rights;investing;ESG issues;native environment;policy makers;nonfinancial reporting;exhibited numerous advantages;accurate data collection;sustainability performance;financial decision making;market firms;nonfinancial information;ESG disclosure;Firm Performance using Machine","","4","","19","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AI may thus redefine the role of leadership in organizations as AI progressively performs new intellectual tasks by replacing human intelligence. While, human limits of domain knowledge and experience restrict decision making, AI with its superior information processing abilities aims at overcoming cognition and complexity. Executives accept that AI will impact workforces as routine and logic based tasks become automated, leading to an increase in demand for EI skills. Even though AI is yet to replace skilled professionals, EI is what machines will remain deprived of. However forging of data, technology and emotional intelligence might be crucial to build an effective decision. HR professionals, policy and decision makers thus intend to leverage potential of AI technologies while seeking ways to offset the negative impacts of AI systems.

The orientation on the technical content of a reference model can increase the efficiency of processes in business engineering projects. Despite this, the use of reference models in the field of business engineering has not established itself in practice. This is due to the particular field of conflict between research and practice, in which reference modeling is at home. Thus, there is still a deficit in knowledge about the use and problems inherent in the implementation of reference models despite the array of theoretical concepts. Accordingly, in the past years the supply-sided development of reference models predominant in the science world has distanced itself from their demand-sided use in business and administration. The article at hand analyses this problem and presents an integrative approach to the computer-aided management of reference models. The task to be mastered using the proposed approach will be conceptually concretized with an framework and prototypically implemented in the form of a reference model management system.","1530-1605","0-7695-2507-5","10.1109/HICSS.2006.489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579310","","Collaborative tools;Design engineering;Business;Process design;Information systems;Engineering management;Context modeling;Knowledge engineering;Artificial intelligence;Prototypes","","","","7","","26","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This comprises the creation of an artificial intelligence agent that is trained in a virtual reality game using a deep reinforcement learning (DQN) algorithm. This will be used as a form of game therapy for children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. The virtual reality game's artificial intelligence can give the child individualized feedback based on their specific skills and how far they've come in the game. As it observes visible growth over time, this can help the child build confidence and self-esteem, which is a win-win situation. This to the enhancement of the child's confidence as well as their general well-being. Multiple studies have shown that artificial intelligence-assisted game therapy is beneficial in enhancing the ability of thinking and overall quality of life of children who have been diagnosed with paraplegia. Children who took part in a virtual reality (VR) game treatment programmed using an artificial intelligence (AI) avatar exhibited significant gains in mental ability to think and their confidence level when compared to others. The usage of a virtual reality (VR) game that incorporates an AI agent that has been trained using the DQN algorithm as a form of game therapy for children who suffer from paraplegia has the potential to significantly improve the children's overall quality of life. Researchers should anticipate seeing even more creative uses of virtual reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical and rehabilitation fields as the technology continues to advance.","","979-8-3503-9663-8","10.1109/ICCES57224.2023.10192628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192628","paraplegia;game therapy;artificial intelligence deep reinforcement learning;deep q-learning network algorithm;virtual reality","Deep learning;Pediatrics;Q-learning;Terminology;Avatars;Medical treatment;Games","artificial intelligence;avatars;computer games;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;reinforcement learning;virtual reality","AI agent trained;artificial intelligence agent;artificial intelligence avatar;artificial intelligence-assisted game therapy;child;children;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;DQN algorithm;paraplegia;PQR-DQN techinique;virtual reality game;VR-game","","","","16","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been significant recent effort in designing small, low-footprint deep neural networks catered for low-power edge devices, with much of the focus on two extremes: hand-crafting via design principles or fully automated network architecture search. In this study, we take a deeper exploration into a human-machine collaborative design approach for creating highly efficient deep neural networks through a synergy between principled network design prototyping and machine-driven design exploration. The efficacy of human-machine collaborative design is demonstrated through the creation of AttoNets, a family of highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device edge deep learning. Each AttoNet possesses a human-specified network-level macro-architecture comprising of custom modules with unique machine-designed module-level macro-architecture and micro-architecture designs, all driven by human-specified design requirements. Experimental results for the task of object recognition showed that the AttoNets created via human-machine collaborative design has significantly fewer parameters and computational costs than state-of-the-art networks designed for efficiency while achieving noticeably higher accuracy (with the smallest AttoNet achieving ~1.8% higher accuracy while requiring ~10x fewer multiply-add operations and parameters than MobileNet-V1). Furthermore, the efficacy of the AttoNets is demonstrated for the task of instance segmentation and object detection, where an AttoNet-based Mask R-CNN network was constructed with significantly fewer parameters and computational costs (~5x fewer multiply-add operations and ~2x fewer parameters) than a ResNet-50 based Mask R-CNN network.","2160-7516","978-1-7281-2506-0","10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025355","","Neural networks;Convolutional codes;Man-machine systems;Prototypes;Collaboration;Task analysis;Network architecture","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;object detection;object recognition","machine-driven design exploration;highly efficient deep neural networks;on-device edge deep learning;human-specified network-level macro-architecture;machine-designed module-level macro-architecture;microarchitecture designs;human-specified design requirements;ResNet-50 based Mask R-CNN network;on-device edge scenarios;low-footprint deep neural networks;low-power edge devices;design principles;network architecture search;human-machine collaborative design approach;principled network design prototyping;AttoNets","","5","","32","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S. government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI technologies or incidents.

A plethora of guidelines, principles, and toolkits have been published globally, but have seen limited grassroots implementation, especially among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills, and resources. In this article, we report on qualitative SME consultations over two events to establish their understanding of both data and AI ethical principles and to identify the key barriers SMEs face in their adoption of ethical AI approaches. We then use independent experts to review and code 77 published toolkits designed to build and support ethical and responsible AI practices, based on 33 evaluation criteria. The toolkits were evaluated considering their scope to address the identified SME barriers to adoption, human-centric AI principles, AI life cycle stages, and key themes around responsible AI and practical usability.

A forecast of these imbalances facilitates next-day planning and provides to stakeholders transparency regarding potential traffic constraints. The use case that motivated the work described in this paper is to develop various machine-learning (ML) models and compare their performance against the current automated tool, which finds operational periods with similar facility (airport) weather and uses the most frequently occurring runway configuration and rates as the capacity forecast for the next day. Extensive model development across five airports and four years of operational data and forecasted weather showed that the ML models consistently had higher accuracy than the automated tool. Among the ML models, superior options were found, but a single best model across all airports and predictions was not.

Depending on the child's individual skills and development, the AI agent in the Virtual Reality(VR) game may provide them with feedback that is specifically suited. If the child observes actual growth over time, this might help to foster confidence and self-esteem. The AI agent may also provide real-time feedback that is responsive to the child's movements, which will help to improve the child's physical function and all-around wellbeing. Many Research have shown how AI-assisted game therapy can improve the motor skills and general wellbeing of paraplegic youngsters. In one such study, children who participated in a Virtual Reality (VR) gaming therapy created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent showed remarkably greater improvements in balance and gait than those who received conventional physical therapy. In order to improve the quality of life for children with paraplegia, this research aims to use an AI agent that has been trained using the Deep Q-Learning Network(DQN) algorithm in a Virtual Reality (VR) game, that should be anticipate seeing much more varied applications of AI and VR in healthcare and treatment as technology advances.","","978-1-6654-5630-2","10.1109/ICAAIC56838.2023.10141031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10141031","Paraplegia;Game Therapy;Virtual Assistant;Artificial Intelligence (AI);Reinforcement Learning;Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) algorithm;Virtual Reality (VR) games;Virtual Reality (VR) health care","Training;Deep learning;Pediatrics;Q-learning;Layout;Medical treatment;Games","computer based training;computer games;deep learning (artificial intelligence);handicapped aids;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;reinforcement learning;virtual reality","agent training;AI agent;AI-assisted game therapy;artificial intelligence agent;artificial intelligence application;child movement;child physical function;deep reinforcement learning deep Q-learning network algorithm;healthcare;paraplegic children;priority experience replay DQN;virtual reality gaming therapy;VR game","","","","17","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Anderegg","The MITRE Corporation, McLean, Virginia, USA; The MITRE Corporation, McLean, Virginia, USA","2020 AIAA/IEEE 39th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","18 Nov 2020","2020","","","1","7","Aviation is a conservative field with a focus on deterministic systems that continuously builds on known risks. Currently, available aviation design assurance methods using safety assurance standards are not suited for regulatory assurance of autonomous systems Aviation is facing enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) technology. The challenge for applicants and regulators is to assure system safety of autonomous systems. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions. This paper explores whether the aviation industry can apply those solutions to UAS and UAM assurance. ANSI/UL 4600, Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products, is the first and only publicly available autonomous safety standard. This standard is backed by a certified non-profit standards organization, Underwriters Laboratories. This standard has been recognized as an international American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved standard. The goal-based, technology neutral features of ANSI/UL 4600 make it adaptable to other industries and applications. It assures safety through monitoring safety performance, which enables the desired aviation regulatory approach. It reflects stakeholder views from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who have contemplated the product liability for the design and manufacturing challenges associated with these new technologies. The applicability to the aviation industry can be understood in terms of these features: Goal-Based and Technology Neutral: ANSI/UL 4600 does not require a specific design approach or specific technology. The applicant company must present an auditable and defensible evidence-based safety case. Those central features of safety and auditability follow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance philosophy and could be adapted to aviation. Continued Airworthiness with Monitored Safety Metrics: The FAA's desire to move to performance-based standards with risk-based strategy is supported by ANSI/UL 4600. Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology. Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability. Applicants could design and test appropriate to their technology while regulators can audit and check for safety case completeness. Over time, industry can standardize some portions of testing as the technology matures. Different standards and codified standard approaches could also be independently designed and adapted as technology becomes standardized across the industry. Aviation regulators are already on this path to make performance-based regulations where applicants have the choice of technology and standards that can support innovation. Industry and Public Stakeholder Engagement: The standard has undergone industry and public scrutiny in the automobile segment with considered reviews from technical, legal, and actuarial perspectives. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) have been working to implement a safety case umbrella that encompasses all facets of UAS and UAM development, operation, and maintenance. The safety case umbrella is a systems approach to combine specific UAS and UAM nuances as they relate to current regulatory structure. While the approach affords a performance-based and risk-based oversight of aircraft design and development, production, maintenance and operation, the current regulations were not written to address AI and specifically machine learning. Even when those advanced techniques are not used, small UASs often use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and technology of unknown pedigree could also be assured by the regulators using that approach. The codified approach of ANSI/UL 4600 could be superimposed on the safety case umbrella approach based on current regulations. The exercise of creating an auditable safety case also increases applicant safety awareness and safety culture. For approval of UAS and UAM, this paper recommends a structured and practical framework with an evidence-based safety case, which also takes into consideration the current regulations for applicability to UAS and UAM safety.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-9825-5","10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256608","Certification;UAS;UAM;Autonomous Systems;AI;Machine Learning;Safety Case;Risk Metrics;Goal-based Regulatory Oversight;Complexity","Safety;Standards;FAA;Industries;Autonomous systems;Monitoring;Artificial intelligence","aerospace computing;aerospace safety;aircraft maintenance;auditing;autonomous aerial vehicles;certification;design engineering;learning (artificial intelligence);legislation;open systems;risk analysis;standards;systems of systems","legal perspectives;MITRE Corporation;machine learning;commercial-off-the-shelf technology;codified standard approaches;artificial intelligence;FAA;OEMs;original equipment manufacturers;Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products;ANSI-UL 4600;automobile industry;aviation regulatory approach;auditable safety;international American National Standards Institute;urban air mobility technology;aviation design assurance methods;system-of-systems interoperability;safety metrics;Federal Aviation Administration compliance philosophy;nonprofit standards organization;UAM assurance;aviation industry;autonomous systems;safety assurance standards;deterministic systems;UAS;unmanned aircraft systems;COTS;aircraft maintenance;aircraft design;risk-based strategy;certification","","4","","14","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper continues the research conducted in earlier publications [1], [2], which introduced the concept of an automated ISO standard robotic testing rig to test a full artificial limb prosthesis (a bio-inspired transfemoral prosthetic socket attached to robotic prosthetic joints and an ankle joint). This paper presents an automated method of designing the bio-inspired socket using artificial intelligence to reduce discomfort and the design time of new or existing full artificial lower limbs using qualitative and quantitative data.

"Modern artificial intelligence for human-robot interaction","H. H. Lund","AdapTronics Group, Maersk Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","Proceedings of the IEEE","25 Oct 2004","2004","92","11","1821","1838","Interaction between humans and traditional robotic systems can be problematic, as the traditional robotic systems often perform repetitive actions in a restricted environment, whereas human interaction is often characterized by novel ways of interactions, which creates an ever-changing environment. Therefore, traditional robotic system methods and technologies are often difficult to apply in situations and applications where the interaction plays a major role. So we developed a new kind of user-guided behavior-based robotics and applied this method to both mobile and humanoid robots, in order to investigate how nonexpert users could develop their own complex robot behaviors within a very short time (e.g., 30-60 min) with no prior knowledge of the robot technology. In the development of the team of humanoid robots, Viki, we used a modern approach to artificial intelligence that puts emphasis on the balance between control, electronic hardware, material, sensory system, and energy. It is possible to develop simple user interfaces with the user-guided behavior-based approach, in order to allow any user to design performances with the humanoid robots. However, we should not only look at the control of robots when designing human-robot interactions, but also on the physical aspects of the robotic system. Therefore, the novel concept of ""programming by building"" is introduced and exemplified with the creation of a prototype system consisting of building blocks with individual processing and communication capabilities. By assembling such building blocks, the user develops both the physical aspects and the functionality of the robotic system in an easy manner with no need to use a host computer or a traditional programming language. The approach is further exemplified with the implementation of neural building blocks that can later be trained by the user.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.835362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347462","","Artificial intelligence;Humanoid robots;Human robot interaction;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Control systems;Robotic assembly;Hardware;User interfaces;Robot control","robots;man-machine systems;artificial intelligence;user interfaces","artificial intelligence;human-robot interaction;robotic systems;user guided behavior based robots;mobile robots;humanoid robots;robot behaviors;robot technology;electronic hardware;sensory system;user interfaces;prototype system;neural building blocks","","16","","18","IEEE","25 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present an AI framework for the detection of patient emotions and emotion transitions based on call recordings of telehealth services. The call recordings are typically a conversation between the caller (patient or carer) and the healthcare practitioner (nurse or counsellor). All primary emotions are expressed across diverse topics during these calls. It is anticipated that the caller emotion state improves during the call due to the information and support received. The proposed AI framework is designed to detect emotions expressed at all stages of the call and based on these expressions, formulate the emotion transition during the call. We have evaluated the proposed AI framework on a large real-world dataset of 60,000 call recordings of cancer information and telephone support services provided by Cancer Council Victoria, Australia.

Partnering with people with SMI to co-produce smartphone apps to support mental health outcomes throughout the software development lifecycle may support patient engagement with smartphone health app interventions. Partnering with this community is often challenging and requires a highly specialized community engagement training and skillset. The purpose of this study was to identify stakeholders' perspectives on partnering to inform the software development lifecycle of a smartphone health app intervention for people with SMI. We conducted thirty-five semi-structured qualitative interviews with 20 mental health patients and 15 peer support specialists. We identified six themes: (1) co-produce health app intervention content; (2) selection of app technology features; (3) integration of human factors in digital health apps; (4) consideration of personalized patient preferences in digital health apps; (5) identify unrecognized concerns early in the software development lifecycle; and (6) inclusion of real-world social, cognitive, and environmental contexts. Integration of these considerations may elucidate the partnering process to facilitate engagement among vulnerable populations that commonly disengage from mental health smartphone apps use such as people with SMI.","2377-6919","978-1-6654-3372-3","10.1109/GHTC53159.2021.9612444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612444","peer support specialists;serious mental illness;marginalized populations;lay interventionist","Training;Conferences;Sociology;Mental health;Software;Electronic healthcare;Stakeholders","health care;human factors;medical computing;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient treatment;smart phones","environmental context;cognitive context;social context;personalized patient preferences;human factors;app technology feature selection;patient engagement;stakeholder engagement;digital health apps;health app intervention content;mental health patients;highly specialized community engagement training;smartphone health app intervention;mental health outcomes;SMI;serious mental illness;software development lifecycle","","1","","19","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research involves a survey of digital assets available through a project; specifically, it identifies sources of data that can be used for practicing data-driven, context-specific project management, or for project-based academic research. It identified four categories of data sources – communications, reports/records, model representations, and computer systems – and 51 digital assets. The list of digital assets can be inputs in the creation of project artifacts and sources for monitoring and controlling project activities and for sensemaking in retrospectives or lessons learned.

However, in order to address both human and machine both disciplines can bring the design team together. In this paper we propose a shared co-design approach for HMT that facilitates a better understanding of system requirements and user interaction. By focusing on context rich scenarios and asking end users to walk through decisions they would make using the system it is possible for both AI and HF team members to obtain critical design information for the HMT. System intent and transparency are essential components within the HMT paradigm, and thus play a central role within the design team. This is particularly relevant when multiple AIs are involved in a decision that is then mediated by the machine. In such instances, the human component is a fundamental component and will often be required to approve or maintain awareness of the decision being generated. This is discussed using examples of user interface design and how the human can be embraced within such AI mediations.","","978-1-6654-5238-0","10.1109/ICHMS56717.2022.9980612","Defence Science and Technology Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9980612","Human-Machine Teams;Design;Al;Human Factors;HCD;Methodology","Machine components;Hafnium;Human factors;User interfaces;Intelligent agents;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis","artificial intelligence;human factors;man-machine systems;user interfaces","AI mediations;artificial intelligence;critical design information;HF team members;HMT paradigm;human component;human factors;human-machine teams;shared co-design approach;user interaction;user interface design","","","","13","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Engaged staff are motivated and indulged in their work as they have a sense of belonging, commitment, and loyalty toward their employer, which eventually leads to better performance and outcomes. While various organizational factors are related to staff engagement, limited research is available regarding what drives staff engagement and the degree of their importance in healthcare. Leveraging data-driven approaches, in this article, we employ three machine learning algorithms, random forests, gradient boosting, and extra trees, to identify the relative importance of organizational factors affecting staff engagement. We use hospital-level aggregate survey data from hospitals in the U.K. While staff engagement is the outcome variable, the following factors are used as organizational factors in the prediction model and feature importance analysis: equality, diversity, and inclusion, safety culture, health and wellbeing, immediate managers, quality of appraisals, quality of care, bullying and harassment, violence, and team working. All the algorithms provide comparable prediction results with similar feature importance ranking with respect to prediction accuracy. The results suggest that safety culture is the most influential factor related to staff engagement, followed by the team working.

This research paper examines the ethical use of AI in social media, focusing on three key areas: content moderation, user manipulation, and the spread of misinformation. We analyze the ethical concerns arising from personal, political, social, and ethical biases embedded within AI algorithms. The paper highlights the challenges of striking a balance between human moderation and algorithmic enforcement, as well as the need to address biases in the decision-making process. We delve into the complexities of content moderation, including the unintended consequences of algorithmic enforcement and the ethical debates surrounding content removal. The paper also explores user manipulation tactics employed in social media and the ethical considerations necessary to protect and empower users against manipulation. Furthermore, we examine AI's role in spreading misinformation and the ethical challenges of detecting and combatting false information while avoiding unintended amplification. To address these ethical concerns, we discuss potential solutions such as enhancing transparency, promoting fairness, and empowering users with control over their AI -driven experiences. Additionally, we present case studies and examples to provide practical insights into the complex ethical landscape of AI in social media. The research paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in AI usage and suggesting future directions for research, collaboration, policy development, and responsible innovation. By addressing the ethical challenges posed by AI algorithms, we can foster an ethical and responsible environment for social media users and ensure that AI serves the best interests of individuals and society.","","979-8-3503-0504-3","10.1109/IWIS58789.2023.10284706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284706","Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Social media;Algorithmic bias;User manipulation;Content moderation","Ethics;Technological innovation;Regulators;Social networking (online);Collaboration;Stakeholders;Artificial intelligence","","","","","","35","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.","","978-1-4503-7512-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10186514","• Software and its engineering → Software creation and management → Software development process management","Industries;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Software systems;Task analysis;Testing;Investment","","","","","","65","","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper introduces a collaborative model to support this concurrent work. First, the architecture of this system is presented. Then a collaborative design model is described in detail. We analyze two reasons for the conflict and give two collaborative modes to coordinate the design process. These two modes can be used in different environments and can be used in a mixed way. So we can keep the consistency of the common solid model and maintain the maximal freedom of the designers at the same time.

Our study illuminates how children reason about ML concepts, offering these insights for designing machine teaching experiences for children: (i) ML metrics (e.g. confidence scores) should be visible for experimentation; (ii) ML activities should enable children to exchange models for promoting reflection and pattern recognition; and (iii) the interface should allow quick data inspection (e.g. images vs. gestures).","1943-6106","978-1-6654-4592-4","10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576171","NSF(grant numbers:1816380); NIDILRR(grant numbers:90REGE0008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576171","child-computer interaction;machine learning;machine teaching;informal learning;AI education","Measurement;Visualization;Education;Machine learning;Inspection;Robustness;Reflection","computer aided instruction;computer science education;learning (artificial intelligence);paediatrics;teaching","machine learning models;machine teaching interfaces;children reason;machine teaching experiences;ML metrics;pattern recognition;data inspection","","","","63","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the unforeseen circumstances and changes pertinent to season, demographics, geopolitical, etc., growth in the agricultural sector has been very constrained, thus keeping the majority below the poverty line. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or MGNREGA, is an Indian labor law that strives to guarantee the ‘right to work. It is a social security measure with a goal to improve livelihood of the adults in the rural areas by providing at least 100 days of unskilled labor work. However, its efficiency is hampered by the inability to accurately track the work on a regular basis. Absence of third-party contractors may be financially beneficial, but it is causing a growing discontentment within the rural households. This paper summarizes two years of rigorous field work and articulates field experience and challenges with the MGNREGA scheme implementation in Dunda village, located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India. The systemic and contextual causes are explored while our stay with the rural community and studied using participatory and user centric methods. This paper presents and proposes a viable solution developed using collaborative approach with the rural workers and village officials in-charge of the scheme's implementation. A wearable smart device to monitor the on-field activity of workers is proposed. A centralized worker report database to record workdays generated by each worker and task details is also proposed. Further, details about task progress and worker compensation can be regulated. It is expected that this sort of activity tracking device will improve the transparency of the process and restore confidence in the MGNREGA scheme at the grassroots.","2572-7621","978-1-6654-3240-5","10.1109/R10-HTC53172.2021.9641738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641738","Live-in-Labs®;MGNREGA;Co-Design;Human Centered Design;Sustainable development;Rural India","Bluetooth;Local government;Wearable computers;Prototypes;Collaboration;Servers;Task analysis","agriculture;economic indicators;employment;environmental factors;government policies;management of change;salaries;water resources","activity tracking device;rural workers;collaborative design;rural population;India;agriculture;unforeseen circumstances;agricultural sector;poverty line;Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act;Indian labor law;social security measure;rural areas;unskilled labor work;rural households;rigorous field work;articulates field experience;MGNREGA scheme implementation;systemic causes;contextual causes;rural community;participatory;user centric methods;collaborative approach;wearable smart device;centralized worker report database;task details;worker compensation;time 100.0 d","","1","","24","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This domain of interest has been variously conceptualized and described in different publications. There is a broader interpretation that considers the entirety of product lifecycle as a target domain and aims at a holistic optimization of all related engineering processes by connecting them through design. There exists a narrower interpretation that concentrates on the enhancement of the product conceptualization and creative design activities in distributed, multidisciplinary and volatile environments. The former is most frequently referred to as collaborative engineering and the latter as collaborative design. The paper concentrates on collaborative design and investigates the concepts, advancements and issues from: (i) philosophical and theoretical, (ii) technological and infrastructural, (iii) organizational and methodological, (iv) social and cultural, (v) cognitive and behavioral perspectives. Based on literature sources and the own work of the author in the last three decades, it provides a broadly-based analysis of the related concepts, knowledge, means, systems and concerns in current research, development and application with the objective to point towards future progression opportunities. The paper identifies a gradual shift in the research interest from the technological and procedural aspects to the socio-cultural, inter-personal and informational aspects. It proposes that collaborative design is eventually about people and that mobile, ubiquitous and smart technologies create many new opportunities for conducting collaborative design.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The reviving of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is changing our lives due to the superior performance in computer vision, nature language processing, and decision making and control tasks. Recently, computing in memristor (CIM) technology is considered as an unconventional approach to meet the urgent needs of high computing efficiency and throughput in continuously developing AI applications. In contrast to von Neumann architecture, computing in memristor technology avoids the data movement between computing units (such as CPU and GPU) and memory unit which would greatly reduce computing latency and power consumption. Memristor is one kind of novel non-volatile memory devices which could not only store information with multi-bit, but also conduct core computing operations of AI algorithm. Assembling memristors in a crossbar structure, it could carry out in-situ parallel multiply-accumulation (MAC) computation. To make the best use of the memristors in neuromorphic systems, a memristor-friendly architecture and the software-hardware collaborative design methods are essential, and the key challenge is how to utilize the memristor’s analog behavior. The talk will discuss recent development of analog computing in memory technology from device engineering, circuit design and architecture optimization perspectives. Further, the system and technology co-optimization (STCO) method is proposed to fully unleash the potential of CIM for practical applications.","1930-8868","978-1-6654-0923-0","10.1109/VLSI-TSA54299.2022.9771006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771006","","Memristors;Artificial intelligence;Throughput;Task analysis;Process control;Power demand;Optimization","AI chips;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;memristor circuits;neuromorphic engineering;optimisation;random-access storage","compute-in-memristor;artificial intelligence technology;computer vision;nature language processing;high computing efficiency;AI applications;von Neumann architecture;memristor technology;computing units;nonvolatile memory devices;core computing operations;AI algorithm;multiply-accumulation computation;neuromorphic systems;memristor-friendly architecture;analog computing;memory technology;circuit design;architecture optimization perspectives","","","","","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to stay safe, throughout the drive experience under four risk conditions (very high risk, high risk, low risk and no risk) that are based on automotive safety and integrity levels (ASIL D, C, B, A), participants exhibit either high or low trust by evaluating the AVs' to be highly or less trustworthy and consequently relying on the Artificial intelligence or the joystick to control the vehicle. The result of the experiment shows that there is significant increase in users' trust and user's delegation of controls to AVs' as risk decreases and vice-versa.

To address these issues, we propose a collaborative PCF property optimization framework as a new paradigm for reverse design. This framework allows experts from different institutions to share their design knowledge and collaboratively optimize the fundamental optical properties of PCFs without direct data interaction.

We recognize that these AI digital tools are a vital aspect of future technological development, but they require input from various sectors in addressing ethics and compliance design. We survey the current landscape of published AI-specific regulatory frameworks and known engineering design process methods. Using a product lifecycle approach, we also introduce a trans-disciplinary framework to address AI ethics and compliance via design. This product lifecycle approach considers several principles: a Human-Centered Design for Risk Assessment, Functional Safety and Risk Management Standardization, and Continuous Governance throughout Product Lifecycle. Establishing risk management throughout AI product lifecycles can ensure accountability for AI product use cases. In addition, by utilizing previous Functional Safety considerations we can create safety mechanisms throughout the product lifecycle of AI digital tools. Finally, establishing in-field testing for continuous governance will enable the flexibility for new compliance standards and transparency. We establish this governance framework to aid in new compliance strategies for these emerging issues with AI digital tools.","","979-8-3503-3984-0","10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195137","Ethics;Compliance;AI;Risk Management;Human-Centered-Design;Engineering Design Thinking","Surveys;Ethics;Law;NIST;Regulation;Safety;Risk management","artificial intelligence;data protection;ethical aspects;risk management","AI digital tool Product Lifecycle Governance Framework;AI digital tools;AI ethics;AI product lifecycles;AI product use cases;European AI Act;forward new digital tools;product lifecycle approach;published AI-specific","","","","20","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies, evaluate corporate reputation using machine learning-focused mostly on positive, neutral, and negative aspects and lacking the multidimensional nature of corporate reputation. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore the integration of the domain ontology approach with machine learning approaches to achieve multi-dimensional classification for online corporate reputation. Overall research route to measure corporate reputation in social media is discussed. The proposed research route starts from retrieving corporate content from digital media for selected domain, next preprocessing data before topics and bag-of-words generated from the extracted data and mapping according to corporate reputation dimensions.

However, since polynomials are always multivariable and large-scale, software algorithms alone are not effective to meet the actual requestments. In addition, the key to polynomial multiplication is the operation of matrix multiplication. Nevertheless, due to the increasingly complex structure of matrix multiplication, it is challenging to realize efficient processing and calculation of large matrices. With the development of FPGA, LSI manufacturing, memory interface and EDA tools, it is possible to apply hardware to the polynomial multiplication. To solve the above problems, we have designed and implemented a polynomial multiplication platform based on FPGA, which combines hardware and software to make up for the shortcomings of current software algorithms and at the same time, it can efficiently and effectively operate polynomial multiplication.","","978-1-6654-8290-5","10.1109/CACML55074.2022.00028","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852579","Polynomial multiplication;FPGA;Matrix multiplication;hardware acceleration","Machine learning algorithms;Image processing;Software algorithms;Machine learning;Software;Hardware;Large scale integration","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;matrix multiplication;polynomials","matrix multiplication;polynomial multiplication platform;FPGA based method;large matrices","","","","35","IEEE","19 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider negotiations over a matter that has multiple issues and each issue can take any one of the multiple possible values for that issue. Two challenges are discussed in detail. The first one is the difficulty of assigning utility value ( i.e. evaluating) each possible contract in large contract spaces. The second is the computational complexity of locating the optimal contract. Previous work proposed grouping contracts to avoid evaluating each contract and a mediated bidding based deal identification algorithm to reduce the search for the optimal contract. However, the computational cost of exhaustively matching bids from agents grows exponentially with the number of agents and bids. We propose a rule that can be used during grouping of contracts (defining constraints) that reduces the number of possible bids from agents and hence increases the number of agents that could participate in the negotiation. We assume that each constraint corresponds to one evaluation criterion. The rule states that when evaluating contracts by a criterion, only contracts that satisfied previous contracts are considered.","","978-1-4577-1908-0","10.1109/INCoS.2011.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132803","collaboration;negotiation;criteria directed reduction","Contracts;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency;Artificial intelligence;Face;User interfaces","computational complexity;multi-agent systems","collaborative negotiations;computational cost;deal identification;utility value;computational complexity;optimal contract;evaluation criterion","","","","9","IEEE","19 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-3687-8","10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678853","Australian Research Council Discovery Grant(grant numbers:DP200101211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678853","machine education;curriculum development;machine teaching;human-machine teaming;instructional design","Heating systems;Knowledge engineering;Educational programs;Systematics;Design methodology;Heat engines;Machine learning","computer aided instruction;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);man-machine systems;multi-agent systems","systematic educational framework;human-machine teaming;artificial intelligence;innovative education system;educational theory-driven approach;content knowledge;HEAT;human education AI teaming framework;human-AI cognitive agent collaboration;AI social integration;machine learning","","","","51","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though they apparently share similar analysis methods, during meetings discrepancies emerged. Different points of view were argued and decisions were made at the end of each meeting. Given the final product acceptance problems, we look back at each meeting and attempt to identify the reasons that led to this unfortunate and common outcome. Understanding the problem enables us to draw a set of guidelines for empowering design meetings with simple technologic methods for improving group final artifact acceptance; therefore diminishing re-work. Our observations point towards (1) a correlation between designers' behavior and future artifact acceptance; (2) a set of actions that interrupts or brings back group attention; and (3) a metric for evaluating group design meetings.

The European funded project StandICT.eu aims at supporting European experts' presence in and contributions to international standardisation activities in ICT. The focus of the project is on the 5 priority domains identified by the European Commission (Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data, Cyber Security, 5G) and on Artificial Intelligence while being open for other relevant topics defined in the annual European Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation. The project has two main outcomes: (i) increased contribution of European experts in international standardisation through support by providing grants for planned contributions of successful applications of experts, and (ii) an online observatory of published standards and ongoing standardisation activities in the areas mentioned before. This observatory (called Standards Watch) is accessible through the project's web site and open for contributions and comments from registered users. As part of the effort for the Standards Watch the projects has prepared a comprehensive analysis of the international standardisation landscape in the AI field, that comprises a description of the ICT standards and ongoing work at international level in the field of AI across the standardisation organisations already active in the field. In this article we will present results of our work where we have analysed the work of the 5 international and European Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) IEEE,11Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [13]. ISO/IEC,22International Organization for Standardization [15]/International Electrotechnical Com mission [12]. ITU-T,33International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector [16].

Based on WordNet and our ontology description language FLoDL, we propose a document type based word frequency accumulation algorithm to solve the problems. This algorithm is carried out in two phases based on different document types: a training phase and a discrimination phase. The discrimination phase is mainly based on the words' frequency information collected in the training process. Finally, through some detailed experiments, a compared analysis is given to show that our algorithm has a far better performance than other previous solutions, thus improves the overall performance collaborative editing","","1-4244-0164-X","10.1109/CSCWD.2006.253235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019271","Collaborative design;Collaborative editing;Ontology;Semantic conflicts;WordNet","Bicycles;Ontologies;Collaborative work;Frequency;Motorcycles;International collaboration;Information technology;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Writing","document handling;groupware;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;text editing","indefinite semantic conflict;collaborative editing;semantic consistency;FLoDL;WordNet;ontology description language;document type based word frequency accumulation algorithm","","","","21","IEEE","4 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed architecture is composed of two visiting levels, i.e., local level and global level. The local level is an ontology-based functional modeling framework, which uses Web ontology language (OWL) to build a domain-specific local functional design ontology repository. Using this local ontology repository, the requests coming from the functional design agent can be parsed and performed effectively. The global level is a distributed multi-agent collaborative virtual environment, in which, OWL is used as a content language within the standard FIPA agent communication language (FIPA ACL) messages for describing ontologies, enabling diverse functional design ontologies between different agents to be communicated freely. The proposed architecture facilitates the exchange between diverse knowledge representation schemes in different functional modeling environments, and supports computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) between multiple functional design agents","","1-4244-0164-X","10.1109/CSCWD.2006.253018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019054","Functional design;Collaborative functional modeling;Semantic Web;Ontology;Multi-agent","Ontologies;OWL;Service oriented architecture;Semantic Web;International collaboration;Virtual environment;Communication standards;Computer architecture;Knowledge representation;Collaborative work","groupware;knowledge representation languages;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","semantic Web-based architecture;collaborative multiagent functional modeling;ontology;Web ontology language;OWL;agent communication language;knowledge representation;computer supported cooperative work;CSCW;functional design","","2","","18","IEEE","4 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume resources from any number of participants’ devices; as well as attempting to clog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection devices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a machine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore, the aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect to misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach where the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection performance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher performance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100% detection accuracy using small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500608","Mobile Crowdsensing;Internet of Things;Machine Learning;risk-awareness;utility loss;Federated Learning","Training;Performance evaluation;Crowdsensing;Machine learning;Loss measurement;Servers;Object recognition","data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;sensor fusion;smart phones","federated learning-based risk-aware decision;mobile crowdsensing leverages;mobile smart devices;malicious user;fake sensing tasks;MCS server;horizontal federated learning;independent detection devices;aggregation entity;machine learning module;prediction loss;loss measurement;risk-aware approach;utility loss;federated learning-driven illegitimate task detection","","3","","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Against this background, this paper motivates the need for collaborative environments for ontology construction, sharing, and usage; identifies the desiderata of such environments; and proposes package based description logics (P-DL) that extend classic description logic (DL) based ontology languages to support modularity and (selective) knowledge hiding. In P-DL, each ontology consists of packages (or modules) with well-defined interfaces. Each package encapsulates a closely related set of terms and relations between terms. Together, these terms and relations represent the ontological commitments about a small, coherent part of the universe of discourse. Packages can be hierarchically nested, thereby imposing an organizational structure on the ontology. Package-based ontologies also allow creators of packages to exert control over the visibility of each term or relation within the package thereby allowing the selective sharing (or conversely, hiding) of ontological commitments captured by a package.","","0-9785699-0-3","10.1109/CTS.2006.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644121","Modular Ontology;Collaborative Ontology;Ontology Building;Package-based Description Logics","Collaboration;Ontologies;Packaging;Logic;Semantic Web;Collaborative work;Artificial intelligence;Laboratories;Computer science;Modular construction","","Modular Ontology;Collaborative Ontology;Ontology Building;Package-based Description Logics","","11","","19","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Collaborative Design Knowledge Conflict Resolution Aided Negotiation Activation Strategy Based on Conflict Degree","H. Lu; H. Shao",NA; NA,"ECITech 2022; The 2022 International Conference on Electrical, Control and Information Technology","25 Jan 2023","2022","","","1","9","With the increasing complexity of engineering design objects, online collaborative design is considered to be a way to solve complex design problems by using multidisciplinary teams and parallel work. However, the coexistence of collaboration and competition among interdisciplinary teams, the coexistence of the consistency of the overall design goals and the heterogeneity of individual knowledge, causes frequent conflicts in the design process. The traditional integrated conflict resolution strategy adopts the corresponding conflict resolution strategy to solve the conflicts in order based on the conflict classification. Essentially, conflict resolution is regarded as a static resolution process, which is a repetitive work of ""detecting conflicts and resolving conflicts"". This article defines the concept of conflict degree by integrating the three dimensions of conflict subject contradiction degree, conflict object complexity and conflict problem impact degree, and links conflict with the collaborative design process, and regards the conflict process as a dynamic development process with the design process. On this basis, for conflicts with a high degree of conflict, the strategy of direct activation assisted negotiation is adopted to shorten the conflict resolution cycle and improve the quality of conflict resolution. Based on the modeling and calculation method of conflict degree, the negotiation process is explained.","","978-3-8007-5916-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026139","","","","","","","","","","25 Jan 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Recent efforts attempting to exploit powerful representations by deep neural networks (DNN) are hindered by the lack of subjectively annotated data. This paper presents a novel BIQA method which overcomes this fundamental obstacle. Specifically, we design a pair of collaborative autoencoders (COAE) consisting of a content autoencoder (CAE) and a distortion autoencoder (DAE) that work together to extract content and distortion representations, which are shown to be highly descriptive of image quality. While the CAE follows a standard codec procedure, we introduce the CAE-encoded feature as an extra input to the DAE's decoder for reconstructing distorted images, thus effectively forcing DAE's encoder to extract distortion representations. The self-supervised learning framework allows the COAE including two feature extractors to be trained by almost unlimited amount of data, thus leaving limited samples with annotations to finetune a BIQA model. We will show that the proposed BIQA method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has superior generalization capability over other learning based models.

Under popularized methods, tensions arise when practitioners attempt to achieve each pillar of fairness, privacy, and transparency in isolation or simultaneously. In this position paper, we push for redirection. We argue that the AI community needs to consider all the consequences of choosing certain formulations of these pillars-not just the technical incompatibilities, but also the effects within the context of deployment.

DRL combines deep learning (DL) for perception and reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making to form a complete automated system from input data to output action control. The deep  ${Q}$ -network (DQN), a typical model of DRL is employed to learn how to design FWG SWSs like human beings, and to apply the learned design experience to meet different application requirements. To verify the effectiveness of this method concretely, a DQN is trained in  ${G}$ -band to explore the general design policy of FWG SWSs for realizing broadband beam-wave interaction, and it will be exploited to search for well-structured FWG SWSs in the frequency band centered at 850 GHz. Using CST to predict the performance of the structure designed by the DQN, the simulation results show that the reflection coefficient  ${S}_{{11}}$  is less than −20.3 dB and the transmission loss is less than 1.95 dB/mm from 750 to 1000 GHz. With a pencil electron beam of 20 kV and 10 mA, the hot simulation results show that the 3-dB bandwidth with the output power greater than 1.6 W and the gain greater than 26 dB can reach 110 GHz from 800 to 910 GHz.

In this paper, the dynamic nature of collaborative design process and the representation of collaborative design knowledge are presented. In order to model constantly evolving design process and the rationales resulted from collaboration, a Collaborative Product Data Model (CPDM), which extends traditional Product Data Model (PDM), and a constraint-based Collaborative Design Process Model (CDPM) are proposed. These are intended to facilitate the management and coordination of collaborative product design process and knowledge management. A design example is used to illustrate CDPM.

The process of designing the vINCI application is based on the patient profile model that will be the input to provide personalized healthcare. The profile is used as evidence to evaluate the impact of vINCI solution on the perceived quality of life provided by caregivers. This paper proposes a complementary approach in modelling the user profile by identifying the needs and preferences of elderly and translating them into development requirements of the vINCI monitoring platform. In this respect, this paper proposes a methodology and methods to define user needs, which are based upon the User Centered Design principles, such as user surveys.

What makes it distinct from other layout designing system is that it employs hierarchically modularization to store all standardized components that are needed for the aging caring space, and embeds intelligence algorithm into the typical evidence-based design for improving design efficiency and reducing design costs. In this paper, we designed and implemented a prototype called iCare Designer, and conducted a preliminary study to understand how this notion works in reality.

Autonomous systems are a diverse class of technologies ranging from AI driven natural language processing and image recognition to closed-form control systems for aircraft autopiloting. Coincident with this explosion in autonomy is a related drumbeat of stories of AI failures. These failures have ranged from tragedies resulting in bystander deaths to humorous examples of video game flaws being exploited. Widespread deployment and use of autonomous systems will depend on society trusting that these systems will perform as expected. While bias from incomplete training data is a well-trod area for improvement toward reducing AI failures, it is unclear if this bias is a sufficient or merely a necessary condition for loss of trust. What else may be needed for public assurance in autonomous systems? Here we identify three features of diverse autonomous systems that serve as a foundation for assured autonomy. These features are: the accuracy with which the algorithm senses and perceives the environment in a manner relatable to humans; a reduction in bias driven by the training data and algorithmic bias; and the complexity of the algorithmic process in terms of the ability to reverse engineer the decision-making processes. Building from this foundation, future autonomous systems can begin to reverse the loss of trust starting to be seen with respect to these technologies.","2158-3412","978-1-7281-5480-0","10.1109/ISTAS48451.2019.8938010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938010","Assured Autonomy;Artificial Intelligence;Trust;Bias","Autonomous systems;Complexity theory;Training data;Control systems;Automation;Image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence);social aspects of automation;technology acceptance model","assured autonomy;artificial intelligence;AI failures;incomplete training data;public assurance;autonomous systems;routine tasks automation;societal acceptance","","1","","33","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert.

Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today's technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a “Human-or-AI” conversation about task assignments to more contextualized “Human-and-AI” way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3078298","U.S. Department of Defense through the Human Autonomy Teaming Essential Research Program of the U.S. DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425540","Human-AI partnership;human-autonomy teaming;sociotechnical systems;AI ecosystems;function allocation;task complexity;capability;use cases;implementation","Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Complexity theory;Tools;Robot sensing systems;Ecosystems;Aging","artificial intelligence;human computer interaction;ubiquitous computing","artificial intelligence;AI-related technologies;human-AI partnership;intelligent technologies","","1","","143","CCBY","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Onboard sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) allow these UAVs to operate autonomously in the environment. However, human intelligence and domain expertise are crucial in planning and guiding UAVs to accomplish the mission. Therefore, humans and multiple UAVs need to collaborate as a team to conduct a time-critical mission successfully. We propose a meta-model to describe interactions among the human operators and the autonomous swarm of UAVs. The meta-model also provides a language to describe the roles of UAVs and humans and the autonomous decisions. We complement the meta-model with a template of requirements elicitation questions to derive models for specific missions. We also identify common scenarios where humans should collaborate with UAVs to augment the autonomy of the UAVs. We introduce the meta-model and the requirements elicitation process with examples drawn from a search-and-rescue mission in which multiple UAVs collaborate with humans to respond to the emergency. We then apply it to a second scenario in which UAVs support first responders in fighting a structural fire. Our results show that the meta-model and the template of questions support the modeling of the human-on-the-loop human interactions for these complex missions, suggesting that it is a useful tool for modeling the human-on-the-loop interactions for multi-UAVs missions.","","978-1-7281-8356-5","10.1109/MoDRE51215.2020.00007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233025","Human Multi-Agent Collaboration, Requirements Elicitation, Autonomous Agents","Analytical models;Surveillance;Tools;Emergency services;Time factors;Requirements engineering;Artificial intelligence","aerospace computing;artificial intelligence;autonomous aerial vehicles;control engineering computing;emergency management;fires;human-robot interaction;multi-robot systems;rescue robots;sensors","meta-model;human-on-the-loop human interactions;human-on-the-loop interactions;model-driven requirements;humans-on-the-loop multiUAV missions;semiautonomous unmanned aerial vehicles;human intelligence;domain expertise;human operators;drones;emergency response scenarios;onboard sensors;artificial intelligence;time-critical mission;autonomous swarm;autonomous decisions;requirements elicitation;search-and-rescue mission;structural fire","","12","","42","IEEE","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283137","","Measurement;Navigation;Government;Public policy;Artificial intelligence;System implementation;Testing","artificial intelligence;ethical aspects","transdisciplinary metrics frameworks;intelligent systems;civil rights organizations;regulatory impact assessments;public policy interventions;AI systems implementation;iterative assessment;enhanced well-being impact assessment framework;ethical rights-based normative principles;artificial intelligence;ethical rights-based AI principles;interdisciplinary metrics frameworks","","1","","78","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the techniques used to estimate effort are often inaccurate, outdated, and only consider technical factors while neglecting project management or stakeholder engagement. Expert estimation remains an important technique for leveraging human expertise in software estimation, but solely relying on this technique causes biased and subjective predictions. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shifted the direction of software project effort estimation towards computational intelligence. Nonetheless, there is a lack of deployment due to ambiguous outcomes and ineffective model-building approaches. This study presents an ensemble-based framework that can estimate software project effort more accurately with the incorporation of domain knowledge and experiences. To achieve this, six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be constructed using six distinct classifiers on the proposed USP05-FT dataset. The collected expert estimations will be integrated into the proposed dataset as an additional feature in the form of numerical values such as expert-provided software project effort estimations (in person hours) that provide additional insight and knowledge. Subsequently, the predictions of all six homogeneous classifier ensembles will be combined through majority voting to obtain a more accurate and reliable prediction with increased robustness against errors and uncertainties. The performance of the proposed framework will be evaluated using Recall, F-measure, Precision, and Accuracy. It is expected that the proposed ensemble-based framework for software project effort estimation will lead to more efficient and effective software project management, an improvement in resource allocation, empowering informed decision-making, and timely project delivery.","","979-8-3503-1093-1","10.1109/ICSECS58457.2023.10256337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10256337","ensemble techniques;expert estimation;machine learning;software project effort estimation","Industries;Uncertainty;Estimation;Project management;Software;Robustness;Software reliability","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;project management;resource allocation","collected expert estimations;effective software project management;efficient software project management;ensemble-based framework;expert estimation;expert-provided software project effort estimations;homogeneous classifier ensembles;machine learning techniques;software estimation;software project effort estimation;successful software project;timely project delivery","","","","43","IEEE","26 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When applying launch bounds predicted by our neural network in BFS and SSSP algorithms, we observe as much as 2.76× speedup on certain graph instances and an overall speedup of 1.31 and 1.61, respectively. Similar improvements are seen in energy efficiency of the applications, with an average reduction of 14% in peak power consumption across 20 real-world input graphs.

Thus, these available strategies are provided for the unstructured multi-agent system: strategy A (performing task A), strategy B (performing task B), and strategy C (not performing any task but only interfere other's actions). Depending on the parameter settings in the payoff matrix, four specific scenarios occur and the corresponding stability of the equilibrium points there are provided by calculation. Numerical calculation results are also provided for an intuitive description of the strategy evolution state. Results show that larger synergistic benefit contributes to the effective division of labor in the system, providing high benefits for the multi-agent system.

This article introduces a concept for collaborative business process modeling and its implementation in the CoMoMod tool. The tool supports several aspects of collaborative process modeling, such as simultaneous work of spatially distributed modelers on one process model diagram. Furthermore the tool permits synchronously creating a collaborative model with different modeling languages by automatically mapping and converting the different model representations.

But the distributed design systems also bring some new problems such as design conflict. To avoid this inconsistent situation, there must be some coordination mechanisms. At the same time, these mechanisms must not constrain the freedom of the designers too much to take their creativity away. This paper introduces a feature-based distributed CAD system to support this collaborative work. We analyze the reason of the design conflict. For addressing this conflict, we present feature-based concurrency operation model. In such model, the feature is the basic atom that can be locked and excluded from other designers using. Comparing with part level concurrency system, this mechanism doesn't limit the design flexibility too much.","","85-285-0050-0","10.1109/CSCWD.2002.1047682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047682","","Collaboration;Design automation;Collaborative work;Network servers;Product design;Concurrent computing;Context modeling;Collaborative tools;Laboratories;Character generation","CAD;groupware;concurrency control","distributed CAD system;collaborative work;collaborative CAD system;feature-based;product design;distributed design;design conflict;design flexibility;feature-based concurrency operation model;client-sever architecture;web-based distributed design;concurrency operation model","","3","","6","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This, however increasingly fell out of favor with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. The proposed system, a Digital Sand Model (DSM) using a Virtual Reality (VR) Workbench, is a digital replica of the same. It involves a leader interacting with the digital environment and other viewers share his view of the digital scene. The system uses a stereoscopic projector, a mirror and Viewing Screen setup to produce a 3D stereoscopic display. This VR system allows performing interactive 3D explorations via stereo camera setup and wearable IR LEDs. A gesture recognition system is also described which allows interaction with the system.

In this paper, an edge-cloud synergy framework for security decision-making is proposed, which takes advantage of the huge convenience and advantages brought by cloud computing and edge computing, and can make security decisions on a global perspective. Under this framework, a combination of Bayesian network-based risk assessment and stochastic game model-based security decision-making is proposed to generate an optimal defense strategy to minimize system losses. This method trains models in the clouds and infers at the edge computing nodes to achieve rapid defense strategy generation.

However, using chatbots as extenders of public services to support mental health in pandemic times is an emerging research topic. Hence, the paper identifies niche and under-explored research gaps in state-of-the-art literature, thus contributing to the body of academic knowledge. The paper adopts a design science approach to formulate the problem statement, articulate the objectives of target solutions, and propose a design and development framework for future mental health chatbots by employing an extensive literature review. Findings from this paper emphasize considerations of ethical issues and governance, purposeful and goal-oriented design, and AI-based technology as critical enablers for designing new mental health chatbots.

This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders’ needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor “reducing kidney discard” and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons. Future work will include developing data-driven models for all stakeholders using current data incorporating the most recent kidney allocation policy changes.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-3992-3","10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773875","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773875","organ placement;artificial intelligence;systems architecture;kidney discard;decision-making;SysML","Decision support systems;Hierarchical systems;Systems architecture;Surgery;Organ transplantation;Behavioral sciences;Stakeholders","artificial intelligence;decision support systems;kidney;medical computing;patient treatment;procurement;systems engineering","incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach;current organ placement process;highly integrated complex system consists;Organ Procurement Organizations;waitlisted kidney candidates;donated deceased donor kidneys;current kidney allocation systems architecture;Artificial Intelligence decision support system;model-based system engineering;AI decision support systems;data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system;donor kidney acceptance","","3","","21","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efforts to create tools and guidelines to help people working with AI development have been concentrating almost solely on the technical aspects of AI. A few exceptions do apply, such as the ECCOIA method for creating ethically aligned AI -systems. ECCOIA has proven results in terms of increased ethical considerations in AI systems development. Yet, it is a novel innovation, and room for development still exists. This study aims to extend ECCOIA with a deployment model to drive the adoption of ECCOIA, as any method - no matter how good -is of no value without adoption and use.

It is a major challenge for the industry to plan and make a decision on the decommissioning as the processes are resource exhaustive. Whether a facility is completely removed, partially removed or left in-situ, each option will affect individual parties differently. Stakeholders’ concerns and needs are collected and analyzed to obtain the most compromised decommissioning decision. Engaging with hundreds of stakeholders is extremely complicated, hence time-consuming and costly. This issue can be addressed using a predictive model to provide suggested decommissioning options based on the data of previously approved projects. However, the lack of readily available relevant datasets is the main hindrance of such an approach. In this paper, we introduce a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset extensively covering all types of offshore infrastructures in the UK landscape over a 21-year period. An experimental framework using several learning algorithms on the new dataset for predicting the decommissioning option is presented. Various resampling methods were applied to tackle the imbalanced class distribution of the dataset for improved classification. Promising results were achieved despite the exclusion of some stakeholder-related features used in the traditional approach. This shows signs of a potential solution for the industry to significantly reduce time and cost spent on a decommissioning project, and encourages more efforts put into researching on this timely topic.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117891","Online Visiting Scholars for World Class Research Collaboration Programme under Reinventing University System 2021 funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9558855","Classification;decision support tool;machine learning;offshore infrastructure;oil and gas decommissioning;supervised learning","Oils;Machine learning;Stakeholders;Predictive models;Tools;Prediction algorithms;Costs","decision support systems;gas industry;learning (artificial intelligence);offshore installations;pattern classification;petroleum industry;production engineering computing","data-driven decision support tool;offshore oil and gas decommissioning;oil and gas offshore infrastructures;learning algorithms;resampling methods;imbalanced class distribution","","3","","73","CCBY","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In developed economies, industry-university collaboration (IUC) is mature and delivers benefits to both stakeholders. In a developing nation like India, there is relatively less emphasis on IUC and when present, is restricted to a small set of premier institutions. At the undergraduate level, the collaboration between industry and university is very minimal to none. This poses major challenges to industry (insufficient qualified talent pool, higher cost of training fresh recruits, limited choice of external research partners) as well as universities (curriculum lagging latest technology, not reaching full research and innovation potential, source for research funding). This paper summarizes the IUC effort undertaken by Intel Technology India Ltd and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at PES University to create mutually rewarding outcomes for both partners and describes a new model encompassing technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship in addition to the traditional elements of IUC. We present the IUC considerations and processes adopted to deal with the challenges and share the outcomes and impact at the end of two years of engagement and hope that key aspects of this IUC can be leveraged by other industry and university stakeholders for mutually rewarding outcomes.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454090","Industry-University Collaboration;Higher Education;Technology;Innovation;Research;Entrepreneurship;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Advanced Driver Assistance System","Industries;Training;Technological innovation;Conferences;Collaboration;Entrepreneurship;Stakeholders","developing countries;educational institutions;further education;industrial training;innovation management;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;research initiatives;technology management","innovation potential;research funding;IUC effort;Intel Technology India Ltd;PES University;university stakeholders;developed economies;developing nation;premier institutions;undergraduate level;external research partners;qualified talent pool;India;industry-university collaboration;technology-innovation-entrepreneurship;AI technologies;ML technologies;fresh recruits training;Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship;universities curriculum","","3","","29","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time. We conclude with a set of guidelines for developing automated feedback for patient populations.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2022.3170831","Leona M. and Harry B.

At present, most strong PUF structures follow a one-to-one input/output relationship, i.e., linear function. As such, strong PUF designs are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) based modeling attacks. To address the issue, a dynamically configurable PUF structure is proposed in this article. A mathematical model of the proposed dynamic PUF is presented and the design is proposed against the effective ML based attacks, such as deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression (LR) and reliability-based covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES). Experimental results on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) show that the proposed dynamic structure has achived good uniqueness and reliability. It is also shown that the dynamic PUF has a strong resistance to the CMA-ES attack.

This paper provides a novel model-based Testbed for Simulation-based Evaluation of Resilience (TeSER) that enables evaluating deep learning based load forecasters against stealthy adversarial attacks. The testbed leverages three existing technologies, viz. DeepForge: for designing neural networks and machine learning pipelines, GridLAB-D: for electric grid distribution system simulation, and WebGME: for creating web-based collaborative metamodeling environments.

Engineers need soft skills to deal with these teams and stakeholders. “How to educate these soft skills to engineering students?” is the central question for technical universities. The course Collaborative Design and Engineering in the Dutch master's programme Construction Management and Engineering is an answer to that question. Feedback, however, indicated that the course did not meet expectations. The course needed a radical redesign. This paper describes the redesign and resulting framework of the course. The principles of the redesign are constructive alignment, activated learning and not to lecture the skills as `dry stuff'. The resulting course is based on a `pressure cooker - coaching' framework. The pressure cooker part creates a situation in which the students will experience stress. The students work in large groups on a complex assignment under time pressure. A mix of group and individual assignments creates tension between students. The coaching part provides structure and guidance. Theory on the necessary soft skills is introduced early in the course in workshops. Consultation meetings help to keep the students on track. The course has now evolved over three years. Theoretical evaluation shows that the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework fulfills the requirements of constructive alignment. Practical evaluation, using feedback, shows a consistent high score. We consider the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework broadly applicable and is successful enough to continue in our CDE course. Elements of the course can be improved. We consider introducing more theoretical depth and psychology without violating our idea of `no dry stuff' and `action learning'.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-1908-6","10.1109/EDUCON.2015.7095956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095956","soft skills;active learning;constructive alignment;engineering education","Iron;Engineering education;Conferences;Artificial intelligence;FAA;Three-dimensional displays","civil engineering;continuing education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching","pressure cooker coaching framework;soft skills teaching;engineering masters programme;collaboration skills;complex infrastructure projects;civil engineering projects;Collaborative Design and Engineering course;Construction Management and Engineering;constructive alignment;activated learning;CDE course;graduate students","","1","","24","IEEE","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While helpful in many ways, designers using CFA still make critical assumptions with regards to community's expressed needs and only passively include the community members in the design process. Appreciative inquiry (AI) is introduced as a means to bridge this gap and increase community empowerment. The AI approach is a four-phase process: discovery, dream, design, and destiny. The process starts with asking community members about their strengths and capabilities, follows with their vision of the community, creates a space for collaborative design, and ends with implementation.

Although the current BIM-related design and software are still new and have many shortcomings, with the development of technology and the continuous improvement of software, the building information model will play a decisive role in the future intelligent information age for oil field construction.","","979-8-3503-2381-8","10.1109/ICDIIME59043.2023.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229739","Building information model;BIM;Architectural design;Standardized design","Solid modeling;Technological innovation;Three-dimensional displays;Oils;Buildings;Companies;Information age","artificial intelligence;building information modelling;CAD;construction industry;structural engineering computing","2D CAD plane;3D information model;architectural design tasks;artificial intelligence;BIM design;BIM model;BIM software;BIM-related design;building information model;construction process;continuous improvement;engineering design software;equipment name;human resources;intelligent information;machinery;oil field construction;oil region;oilfield development;oilfield industry upgrading;structure type;technical transformation;two-dimensional design","","","","6","IEEE","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the delay-based PUF structures in authentication protocols have static responding behaviors, which make them vulnerable to modeling attacks. To address this issue, many complex PUF designs have been designed to increase the nonlinearity of their models. However, most of them can still be broken by modeling-based machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a dynamic responding mechanism for PUF designs to generate dynamic responses is proposed. Different from the concept of logically reconfigurable PUFs, the proposed mechanism does not rely on external inputs to provide reconfiguration signals. And different from the conventional PUF authentication protocols that use large-size linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to extend the master challenge, the proposed scheme uses internally generated dynamic signals to obfuscate the master challenge to generate multiple subchallenges. These subchallenges are then input to the underlying strong PUF to generate multibit dynamic responses. It can prevent an attacker from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs) for the underlying PUF. A security authentication protocol is also proposed, the special authentication bit-string design can resist both conventional ML attacks and the latest covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES) variant.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2022.3189953","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62022041); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NP2022103); Royal Society Research(grant numbers:IEC/NSFC/211024); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/N508664); EPSRC Quantum Communications Hub(grant numbers:EP/T001011/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830631","Authentication protocol;dynamically configurable;machine learning (ML);physical unclonable function (PUF)","Authentication;Protocols;Physical unclonable function;Security;Resists;Mathematical models;Internet of Things","covariance matrices;cryptographic protocols;cryptography;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);shift registers;telecommunication security","large-size linear feedback shift register;master challenge;dynamic signals;underlying strong PUF;multibit dynamic responses;valid challenge-response pairs;underlying PUF;security authentication protocol;special authentication bit-string design;conventional ML attacks;generic dynamic responding mechanism;secure authentication protocol;strong PUFs;physical unclonable functions;reliable identity authentication;delay-based PUF structures;static responding behaviors;modeling attacks;complex PUF designs;modeling-based machine learning attacks;logically reconfigurable PUFs;reconfiguration signals;conventional PUF authentication protocols","","1","","41","IEEE","15 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not suitable for IoT networks due to their large resource requirements. Moreover, IoT networks tend to have multiple access points for IoT devices and thus benefit from a distributed framework to enable collaborative prevention of potential attacks. To this end, we propose a lightweight collaborative distributed network IDS (NIDS) based on widely-utilized machine learning (ML) models, which are trained through a federated learning framework with two known datasets. We evaluate the distributed NIDS using the trained ML models on an IoT network testbed under seven types of attacks in comparison with Snort (a state-of-the-art IDS) and a centralized implementation of our proposed NIDS. An offline benchmark is also designed to measure the system’s performance with regard to resource usage and response time. Our results show that the proposed distributed NIDS outperforms Snort in identifying malicious traffic and achieves a much lower false positive rate compared to the centralized version in real-time for all seven types of network attacks tested.","","979-8-3503-4655-8","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-ScalCom-DigitalTwin-PriComp-Metaverse56740.2022.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189569","Intrusion Detection;Internet of Things;Machine Learning;Network Security","Federated learning;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Time measurement;Critical infrastructure;Internet of Things","computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence)","distributed NIDS;Internet-of-Things networks;intrusion detection systems;IoT devices;IoT network;lightweight collaborative distributed network IDS;lightweight collaborative inferencing;machine learning models;network attacks;real-time intrusion detection","","","","24","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous approaches to assess agreement, grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this work, we represent the gestures using binary description vectors to allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as a soft agreement rate (SAR) to quantify the level of consensus between the participants. In addition, we performed computational experiments to study the behavior of our partial agreement formula and mathematically show that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our methodology was evaluated through a gesture elicitation study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR metric is 2.64 times higher than the existing metrics. In addition to the most agreed gesture, SAR formulation also provides the mostly agreed descriptors which can potentially help the designers to come up with a final gesture set.","","978-1-7281-3079-8","10.1109/FG47880.2020.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320172","gestures;agreement analysis;semantic descriptors;and gesture elicitation","Proposals;Measurement;Shape;National Institutes of Health;Indexes;Radiology;Particle measurements","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;vectors","soft agreement rate;partial agreement formula;agreement metrics;gesture elicitation study;user-elicitation study;SAR metric;agreed gesture;SAR formulation;final gesture;gesture agreement assessment;participatory design;popular design technique;design process;user-friendly gestural interfaces;guessability studies;agreement analyses;equivalence classes;integral properties;binary description vectors","","2","","23","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a systematic literature review of requirements validation is performed. The study analyzes the most adopted validation techniques, reports requirements quality characteristics, and discovers significant challenges of validation techniques. The review identified 66 relevant primary studies analyzed to derive deep insights into the following aspects of requirements validation: trends of requirements validation methods, including their subtechnique strengths and weaknesses, requirements quality characteristics categories, and adopted tools and datasets in these techniques. We grouped validation techniques into categories: prototyping, inspection, knowledge-oriented, test-oriented, modeling and assessment, and formal models. The analysis reported 19 validation techniques, 27 tools, new requirements validation characteristics, and several challenges that prevailed through validation techniques. The trend of validation techniques is to those methods that apply machine learning techniques with knowledge from dictionaries and ontologies. Most challenges are about how to express the requirements and how to revert clients’ feedback. There is a strong relationship between validation techniques, software application domain, and requirements validation quality attributes.

Taking the Google Cardboard as our focused headset, we first conducted a gesture-elicitation study to generate 150 user-defined gestures with 50 on each surface. We then selected 15, 9, and 9 gestures for the front, the left, and the right surfaces respectively based on user preferences and signal detectability. We constructed a data set containing the acoustic signals of 18 users performing these on-surface gestures, and trained the deep-learning classification pipeline for gesture detection and recognition. Lastly, with the real-time demonstration of GestOnHMD, we conducted a series of online participatory-design sessions to collect a set of user-defined gesture-referent mappings that could potentially benefit from GestOnHMD.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3067689","Young Scientists Scheme of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61907037); Applied Research Grant(grant numbers:9667189); Centre for Applied Computing and Interactive Media (ACIM) in School of Creative Media; City University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382928","Virtual Reality;Smartphone;Mobile VR;Google Cardboard;Gesture","Internet;Headphones;Acoustics;Sensors;Pipelines;Smart phones;Microphones","acoustic signal processing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);gesture recognition;helmet mounted displays;human computer interaction;image classification;mobile computing;smart phones;virtual reality","low-cost VR head-mounted display;low-cost virtual-reality head-mounted displays;immersive VR;GestOnHMD;gesture-classification pipeline;commodity smartphone;scratching gestures;mobile VR headset;focused headset;signal detectability;on-surface gestures;deep-learning classification pipeline;gesture detection;user-defined gesture-referent mappings;gesture-based interaction;gesture-elicitation;stereo microphones;tapping gestures;Google Cardboard;user preferences;acoustic signals;gesture recognition;online participatory-design sessions","Acoustics;Adult;Computer Graphics;Deep Learning;Equipment Design;Female;Gestures;Hand;Humans;Male;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Smart Glasses;Smartphone;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","7","","69","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to reduce the cycle of verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) and increase the probability of successful design within fewest iterations, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) proposes a design information transferring methodology based on digital models, which extends the V model to double Vs model.

Based on the Assembly Process Modeling Methodology (APM) developed at the Assembly Automation Laboratory, where the product definition includes both logical and physical building blocks, and the dependencies between them, the development of an Intelligent Task Planning system built upon a Collaborative Web-based environment will enable the integration of the product design process and the assembly system design process. The Product Model definition will consist of a network or hierarchy of interrelated items, where each item has an interface, which contains all the necessary information to verify the item's compliance with the other items in the product definition. The relationships are defined as configuration rules, which can be formally specified in a syntax language. Based on the principle that all intelligent assembly task-planning systems can be structured as a typical knowledge-based system, the use of a software environment that allows the re-use of components, and database independency increases the robustness of the system. The integration of object-oriented and machine learning techniques for intelligent task planning into the system, adds the capability of using complex entities such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) models. The system will serve as an integration point between the product design phase and the assembly system deployment, embracing the capabilities of a web environment, enabling the development team to work remotely over the Internet on one framework, with zero-latency sharing of information. The system enables direct connectivity to Product Data Management (PDM) or Requirements Management (RM) systems, though the use of Java and Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset. An example such term is described and presented as proof of application. The semantic modelling implemented in this work is directly applicable to a previously proposed visual data structure and subsequent authoring environment that could facilitate XR resource design and authoring from non-technical experts.","","978-1-7348995-2-8","10.23919/iLRN52045.2021.9459388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459388","mixed-reality;co-creation;user-experience;data-modelling;ontologies","Visualization;Vocabulary;Taxonomy;Mixed reality;Medical services;Ontologies;Data structures","authoring systems;biomedical education;computer aided instruction;data structures;data visualisation;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","nominated ENTICE ontology;medical terms;educational properties;XR digital asset;visual data structure;subsequent authoring environment;medical ontology informed user experience taxonomy;Co-creative Workflows;authoring Mixed Reality medical education spaces;curriculum size;healthcare education;knowledge retention;skills acquisition;healthcare sector;core challenge;increasing costs;designing developing XR immersive educational content;participatory design methods;Co-creation approaches;content development;educators;decentralized bottoms-up content creation;data modeling approaches;digital asset discoverability;visual authoring tools;UX taxonomy;asset level;Simple Knowledge Organization System vocabulary;devised taxonomy;ontology terms","","2","","68","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is knowledge about the state of a particular environment, thus needs frequent exchange of information about other collaborators and the whole group. Bitmap-based collaborative graphics editing systems are a special class of CESs. Because of the intrinsic characteristics of bitmap, the data-streams need to be exchanged in the network will increase dramatically. On the other hand, different collaborators in one collaborative group may have different collaborative requirement and different network environment. So it is not wise to deliver the same large data-stream to distinct receivers. Instead, we propose a multi-level coding method, which encodes each bitmap operation into several different granularities. As a result, different collaborators receive different data-stream in different granularity according to their current requirement and network condition. In addition, we also propose a self-adaptive awareness model by combining the awareness model with network QoS. It adjusts the awareness strategy and awareness coefficient intelligently to make the awareness model adaptive to the network condition. It also reallocates the network resources among the whole collaborative group, thus optimizes the collaborative effect.","","0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260076","","Real time systems;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Costs;Computer graphics;Educational institutions;Computer science;Intelligent networks;Adaptive systems;Collaborative software","bit-mapped graphics;groupware","self adaptive awareness model;real time collaborative graphics editing system;workspace awareness;CES;collaborative editing system;bitmap based collaborative graphics;data streams;network environment;multilevel coding method;bitmap operation;QoS;quality of service;awareness coefficient","","1","","17","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intellectual property is the core resource in the crowdsourcing design service model, which is faced with various risks due to the lack of effective control. In this context, this paper proposes an intellectual property risk assessment method based on an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in crowdsourcing design. First of all, the influencing factors of intellectual property risk in crowdsourcing design are analyzed, and a set of intellectual property risk assessment index system is constructed. Secondly, a risk assessment model based on ANFIS is established to quantitatively assess intellectual property risks in crowdsourcing design. Finally, the proposed ANFIS model has been trained and evaluated, and the experimental results show that the method can achieve accurate evaluation of intellectual property risks.","","978-1-6654-1736-5","10.1109/MLISE54096.2021.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611687","Crowdsourcing design;Risk assessment;ANFIS","Crowdsourcing;Fuzzy logic;Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Adaptive systems;Intellectual property;Risk management","crowdsourcing;fuzzy reasoning;industrial property;network theory (graphs);product development;production engineering computing;risk management","risk assessment model;adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system;crowdsourcing design service model;intellectual property risk assessment method;intellectual property risk assessment index system;ANFIS;manufacturing industry;service-oriented product development","","","","9","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They attempt to design innovative services to support the value creation of their customer's business. In this context the knowledge is becoming a key matter for strategy and innovation. Many scholars have stressed the knowledge management approaches for the design of products. However services provide new issues which are linked to their own characteristics (e.g. intangibility, heterogeneity, coproduction). The methods and tools of knowledge management have to be adapted to the field of services design. Indeed it is important to acquire, represent and reuse the service-related knowledge which is tacit and co-created by providers, customers and others partners working together. Our work pursues the ongoing discussion of SSME (services science, management and engineering), an emergent discipline gathering the synergies around services science. It is also based on the example of a telecommunication operator which is trying to improve its methods to design services. Our approach is supported by a framework which describes services as services systems and a Web-based studio called SBCD (services browser for collaborative design). This paper gives an overview of this framework's main features (change of state, co-construction, business processes, services medium and access). Then it focuses on the role of knowledge in this context and proposes a knowledge acquisition method for the construction of an ontology to describe services systems.","","978-1-4244-4135-8","10.1109/ICCIE.2009.5223669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223669","SSME;services systems;services design;tacit and co-created knowledge;knowledge acquisition","Knowledge management;Environmental economics;Companies;Technological innovation;Product design;Engineering management;Design methodology;Collaboration;Context-aware services;Knowledge acquisition","business data processing;CAD;current-mode logic;customer services;economics;groupware;innovation management;Internet;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;ontologies (artificial intelligence);product design","knowledge management;innovative services systems;economic environment;services orientation;customer business;product design;service-related knowledge;services science;services management;services engineering;telecommunication operator;Web-based studio;services browser for collaborative design;business processes;services medium;services access;knowledge acquisition method;ontology construction","","","","14","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To personalize learning on a massive scale, social bots can be used as supporting technology. However, their development for virtual learning environments currently requires deep technical knowledge. This leaves learner communities relying on highly-skilled developers to generate and tailor these social bots. Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots. We see the potential of this approach to move the development closer to the actual learner.","","978-1-7281-6739-8","10.1109/CIC48465.2019.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998476","social bots;model driven development;virtual learning environments;end user integration;deep learning","Adaptation models;Collaboration;Machine learning;Model-driven development;Task analysis;Training;Bot (Internet)","computer aided instruction;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);software agents","generative bots;open source deep learning technologies;model-driven generation;social bots;end-user development;self-hosted virtual learning environments;OpenAPI specifications;model-driven approach","","8","","36","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then examine the major recent proposals from the OECD, the EU and the IEEE on ethical governance of Trustworthy AI systems in terms of their scope and use of normative language. From this analysis, we propose a preliminary minimal model for the functional roles relevant to Trustworthy AI as a framing for further standards development in this area. We also identify the different types of interoperability reference points that may exist between these functional roles and remark on the potential role they could play in future standardization. Finally we examine a current AI standardization effort under ISO/IEC JTC1 to consider how future Trustworthy AI standards may be able to build on existing standards in developing ethical guidelines and in particular on the ISO standard on Social Responsibility.

Though the increase of the Internet as a communication means that supports the sharing and transferring of knowledge, the collaborative declarative design phase lacks for a) imprecision in declaring the statements (ambiguity) and b) subjective interpretation of a scene with respect to the current designer's profile. For this reason, on-line learning strategies should be applied, which models the actual user's preferences. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptable learning strategy for dynamic modeling of a designer profile based an adaptable neural network architecture. The scheme optimally updates the network weights in a way that the current designers' preferences are trusted as much as possible, while simultaneously a minimal degradation of the already obtained network knowledge is minimized. The algorithm requires low computational complexity and guarantees stable performance instead of conventional neural network training schemes, whose the solution is often trapped to local minima.","2375-0197","978-0-7695-3015-4","10.1109/ICTAI.2007.154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410416","","Recursive estimation;Layout;Neural networks;Internet;Collaborative tools;International collaboration;Process design;Computer architecture;Degradation;Computational complexity","CAD;distance learning;groupware","optimal recursive designers profile estimation;Internet;knowledge sharing;knowledge transferring;online learning strategies;adaptable learning strategy;computational complexity;collaborative declarative design","","3","","12","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has many advantages such as shared API data interfaces, high data integration, data consistency, data relevance and construction demonstration functions. It has been widely used and achieved remarkable results. In the 21st century, the development trend of Beijing city is to develop towards the sky and underground. Especially in the past ten years, with the increase of high-rise and super high-rise buildings in Beijing, and the booming development of subway construction. The underground continuous wall is a construction technology with very high use value whether it is used as the main body (or part of the main body) of the underground structure or as a waterproof and soil retaining facility during construction. However, in the Beijing area, the underground diaphragm wall (depth greater than 40 meters, width greater than or equal to 1.2 meters) due to the difficulty of the project, complex technology, and many construction problems, the relevant design and construction experience is less, and the relevant technical talents are scarce. The purpose of this article is to study the application of BIM in underground continuous walls. This article is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 development platform, based on the Visual C# programming language, using the API data interface provided by the Revit 2018 software, based on the built BIM model, for engineering quantity statistics, collision checking, drawing output, collaborative work and construction models. Wait for operations to show the application of BIM technology in the underground continuous wall. Experiments show that the use of the collision detection function of BIM technology can not only reasonably arrange pipelines, but also adjust the positions of brackets, buttresses and other components to facilitate the on-site installation of pipelines. The use of BIM technology can simulate the hoisting of the pipe gallery, find out the collision points in the hoisting process, and improve the hoisting plan.","","978-1-6654-7400-9","10.1109/AIE57029.2022.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9898689","building information model;diaphragm wall;construction simulation;collision check","Meters;Visualization;Buildings;Pipelines;Urban areas;Companies;Soil","application program interfaces;building management systems;buildings (structures);civil engineering computing;construction;construction industry;data visualisation;design engineering;diaphragms;geographic information systems;geotechnical engineering;hoists;project management;soil;structural engineering;structural engineering computing;walls","API data interface;built BIM model;underground continuous wall;BIM technology;Building Information Modeling;information technology;construction industry;shared API data interfaces;high data integration;data consistency;data relevance;high-rise buildings;subway construction;construction technology;underground structure;underground diaphragm wall;construction problems;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 development platform;size 1.2 inch","","","","12","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, automation design is often driven by user-centered intentions, while the development is actually technology-centered. This can be attributed to a discrepancy between the system designers’ perspective and complexities in real-world use. The same can be currently observed with AI applications where most design efforts focus on the interface between humans and AI, while the overall system design is built on preconceived assumptions. To understand potential usability issues of AI-driven cockpit assistant systems from the users’ perspective, we conducted interviews with four experienced pilots. While our participants did discuss interface issues, they were much more concerned about how autonomous systems could be a burden if the operational complexity exceeds their capabilities. Besides commonly addressed human-AI interface issues, our results thus point to the need for more consideration of operational complexities on a system-design level.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582448","interviews;thematic analysis;intelligent cockpit assistant systems;human-AI interaction;imperfect AI","Industries;Conferences;Complexity theory;Stakeholders;Artificial intelligence;Usability;Interviews","aerospace computing;air traffic;artificial intelligence;human computer interaction;human factors;user interfaces","pilot attitudes;aviation industry;air traffic;human-centered approach;automation design;user-centered intentions;usability;AI-driven cockpit assistant systems;experienced pilots;autonomous systems;operational complexity;human-AI interface;system-design level;technology-centered intentions","","","","27","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users can be dynamically migrated between the nodes, and the ultimate goal for the migration policy is to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. In order to achieve this, the user migration policy should minimize network communication while balancing the load among the nodes so that CPU resources of the individual nodes are not overloaded. This paper considers a multi-player online game as an example of a DVE and presents an adaptive distributed user migration policy, which uses Reinforcement Learning to tune itself so as to minimize the average system response time perceived by the users. Performance of the self-tuning policy was compared on a simulator with the standard benchmark non-adaptive migration policy and with the optimal static user allocation policy in a variety of scenarios, and the self-tuning policy was shown to greatly outperform both benchmark policies, with performance difference increasing as the network became more overloaded.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6182-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966364","","Servers;Time factors;Learning (artificial intelligence);Computer architecture;Tuning;Mathematical model;Games","computer games;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;virtual reality","average system response time minimization;network communication minimization;load balancing;multiplayer online game;adaptive distributed user migration policy;reinforcement learning;self-tuning policy performance;optimal static user allocation policy;CPU resources;multiple network nodes;DVE;dynamic adaptation;distributed virtual environments","","","","16","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs.

As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking.

Thereby, making decisions in such systems remains a very hard issue. To assist decision makers in formulating the appropriate strategies, robust tools are needed. Pure optimization models are not appropriate for several reasons. First, an optimization model cannot capture the dynamic behavior of a complex system. Furthermore, most common practical problems are very constrained to be modeled as simple tractable models. To fill in the gap, hybrid optimization/simulation techniques have been applied to improve the decision-making process. In this paper we explore the near-full spectrum of optimization methods and simulation techniques.

However, significant barriers exist when sharing product design knowledge due to the lack of available formalized tools and methods. In this article, to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders during product design, a method to systematically improve the understanding of target objects, including the composition of the object, nature of the object, and tools to support its related communication, is proposed. Further, a knowledge representation framework is described which enables parties to clearly understand the characteristics of the object and greatly improve communication efficiency.

As in the original co-training paradigm, the text is classified according to two independent learner views using two separate classifiers. In order to extend this idea to deep learning, the deep co-training model uses deep neural networks to train on different views of generated samples to calculate similarity in the probability distribution of predicted outcomes. This co-training framework depends on co-trained networks in order to classify text into multiple labels. Furthermore, the method adds noise to keep the classifier from being affected by it during prediction. As a result, such co-trained networks provide more relevant data and improve classification accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach, we compare it to state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning classifiers on a dataset of survivor stories of human rights violations.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671498","Economic and Social Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671498","Deep learning;semi-supervised learning;co-training;data mining;machine learning;human rights violation;multi-label classification;probability distribution;neural networks;text classification","Deep learning;Training;Text categorization;Neural networks;Supervised learning;Big Data;Semisupervised learning","deep learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;social sciences computing;text analysis","human rights violations;deep multilabel co-training;multilabeled semisupervised study;labeled dataset;unlabeled dataset;co-training framework;two-view semisupervised learning;text classification;original co-training paradigm;independent learner views;deep co-training model;deep neural networks;co-trained networks;classifier;deep learning classifiers","","3","","34","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we examine what human-centric issues end-users report through Google App Store reviews, what human-centric issues are a topic of discussion for developers on GitHub, and whether end-users and developers discuss the same human-centric issues. We then investigate whether an automated tool might help detect such human-centric issues and whether developers would find such a tool useful. To do this, we conducted an empirical study by extracting and manually analysing a random sample of 1,200 app reviews and 1,200 issue comments from 12 diverse projects that exist on both Google App Store and GitHub. Our analysis led to a taxonomy of human-centric issues that characterises human-centric issues into three-high level categories: App Usage, Inclusiveness, and User Reaction. We then developed machine learning and deep learning models that are promising in automatically identifying and classifying human-centric issues from app reviews and developer discussions. A survey of mobile app developers shows that the automated detection of human-centric issues has practical applications.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.","","978-1-6654-7477-1","10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185519","smart home;vulnerable group support;homeless support;chronic disease management;senior care;independent living;smart energy management;smart infrastructure support;smart response system for urgent situations;smart mobility;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;smart lifestyle management;smart community user acceptance;Universal Village;smart monitoring;smart activity understanding;human-computer interaction;computer vision;machine learning;safety and security;adversarial attach;reinforcement learning;adaptive control;system theory;dynamic relationship;coordination & automation;closed feedback loop;robustness & resilience;sustainability","Home appliances;Smart cities;Decision making;Smart homes;Medical services;Safety;Older adults","data acquisition;decision making;Digital Divide;feedback;hazardous materials;health care;home automation;information management;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;smart cities;town and country planning","current Smart Home material cycle;current Smart Homes lack robustness;effective Smart Home;inclusive, UV Smart Home framework design;information flow;resilient UV Smart Home framework design;Smart Home applications;Smart Home subsystems;smart response system;smart subsystems;sustainable UV Smart Home framework design;UV Smart Home concept;UV Smart Home system","","","","471","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the light of digital transformation, an increasing amount of pedagogy literature, policy papers, and practitioners call for the development of digital competences. However, concrete approaches to tackle this issue in practice are still scarce. We followed a participatory action research approach together with stakeholders of a university of applied sciences to develop the foundations of a curriculum to equip engineering graduates with additional managerial, social, and psychological insights and approaches to succeed in digital transformation or Industry 4.0 projects in manufacturing companies. In several workshops with undergraduates, faculty, alumnae, researchers, and industry representatives the needs and prospective job profiles of such digital transformation managers were defined. The therefore required competences were prioritized applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by comparing the necessary knowledge, skills, as well as attitudes and values (KSA). The results first show difficulties in establishing a common understanding of required competences between the stakeholders due to the complexity of the notion of digital transformation. Nevertheless, the stakeholder involvement process and the AHP as decision support can serve as a suitable basis for the design process of engineering curricula, as well as in other contexts.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657471","ECSEL Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:783163); BMBF(grant numbers:03WIR2704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657471","competences;digital transformation;higher education;stakeholders;Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)","Industries;Conferences;Psychology;Analytic hierarchy process;Companies;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Complexity theory","analytic hierarchy process;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;psychology","competence development;higher education;paricipatory action research;analytic hierarchy process;digital competences;psychological insights;industry representatives;digital transformation managers;stakeholder involvement process;curriculum design;policy papers;pedagogy literature;engineering graduates;managerial insights;social insights;Industry 4.0 projects;manufacturing companies;undergraduates;job profiles;KSA;AHP;decision support","","","","28","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have collected Facebook data from 153 public health care organizations and conducted a survey on them. 12% of organizations responded to the questionnaire. The survey results were combined with the findings from our previous work of applying clustering and supervised learning algorithms on big social data from the official Facebook walls of these organizations. In earlier research, we showed that the most successful strategy that leads to higher post engagement is visual content. In this paper, we investigated if organisations pursue this strategy or some other strategy that was successful and has not been uncovered by the machine learning algorithms. Performance of each organisation on Facebook is based on the number of posts (volume share) and the number of actions (value share). Calculation of performance with number of actions in the numerator and number of posts in the denominator reduces possible bias in the conclusions due to the varied size of organizations on social media. Moreover, our survey attempts to better understand the behaviour of organizations and to explain why almost half of the public health care content posted on Facebook is in the form of a short text message, where as the information can be communicated through seven other post types. Similar patterns and characteristics for different engagement clusters, also high and low performing companies suggests that a mixed-methods research approach consisting of machine learning techniques combined with expert knowledge using qualitative methods can offer important insights.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258288","Big Social Data;Social Media Performance;Social Media Strategy;Facebook data","Facebook;Organizations;Public healthcare;Visualization;Twitter","health care;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);social sciences computing","social media managers;Facebook data;big social data;official Facebook walls;machine learning algorithms;public health care content;high performing companies;low performing companies;facebook post performance;post engagement;public health care organizations;engagement clusters;short text message","","1","","30","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article presents a comprehensive workflow for unexploded ordnance surveys in the sea and focuses on aspects of quantitative data quality control. For this purpose, data quality factors and corresponding threshold values were developed for each of the main sensor types. The authors designed and moderated a workshop-based stakeholder engagement process to establish expert consensus on suitable data quality factors and appropriate calculation of thresholds that define which data are sufficient and which are not. This approach was accompanied by a literature review of existing guidelines, standards, and survey recommendations. A quantitative description of data quality eases analyzing and comparing newly acquired and existing data. This article presents the results of this process, thereby providing guidance for the planning, execution, and quality control of a technical investigation with the aim of finding unexploded ordnance in the sea.

Collocated meetings can however be impractically expensive, severely limit the concurrency and thus breadth of interaction, and are prone to serious dysfunctions such as polarization and hidden profiles. Social media such as email, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and web forums provide unprecedented opportunities for interacting on a massive scale, but have yet to realize their potential for helping people deliberate effectively, typically generating poorly-organized, unsystematic and highly redundant contributions of widely varying quality. Large-scale argumentation systems represent a promising approach for addressing these challenges, by virtue of providing a simple systematic structure that radically reduces redundancy and encourages clarity. This paper will address this important question, discussing (1) the strengths and limitations of current deliberation technologies, and (2) how large-scale argumentation can help address these limitations.","","978-1-61284-639-2","10.1109/CTS.2011.5928678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928678","deliberation;large-scale argumentation","Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Diseases;Redundancy;Security;Business;Meteorology","humanities;social networking (online)","MIT deliberatorium;large-scale deliberation;complex systemic problems;serious dysfunctions;social media;large-scale argumentation systems;humanity","","14","","","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fuzzy ontology introduces the fuzzy concepts as values of properties and extends the ordinary relationships to fuzzy relationships and intuitionistic fuzzy relationships.

The infrastructure of the distribution systems consists of resources, treatment plants, reservoirs, distribution lines, and consumers. A sustainable water distribution network management has to take care of accessibility, quality, quantity, and reliability of water. As water is becoming a depleting resource for the coming decades, the regulation and accounting of water in terms of the above four parameters is a critical task. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of a monitoring and controlling framework, capable of automating various stages of the water distribution processes. The current trending technologies such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to track this spatially varying network to collect, process, and analyze the water distribution network attributes and events.

However, collaborative learning approaches are still not beneficial in every e-learning experience because they require people's presence and collaboration is many times difficult to achieve. It is remarkable that collaborative learning resources still suffer from endemic problems, such as the lack of authentic interactivity, user empowerment, social identity and challenge, thus having a negative effect in learner motivation and engagement. To overcome these and other limitations and deficiencies, we propose a new type of learning object named Complex Collaborative Learning Objects to support the virtualization of collaborative sessions with the aim to leverage the knowledge elicited during live sessions of collaborative learning, which are augmented with author-generated information, in order to produce interactive and attractive resources to be played by learners. In order to improve social engagement, during the CC-LO execution, a VCS is animated so learners can observe how avatars discuss and collaborate, how discussion threads grow and how knowledge is been constructed, refined and consolidated. Furthermore, learners can interact with the CC-LO to modify some parameters observing the consequences and assessing their understanding.

With intelligent networks' growing role, from facilitators in support of humans' lives and well-being to the future role as systems “designing relations between humans and the world”, their design will determine to a greater extent the character of the way humans' live their lives. At the same time, the rapid evolution of intelligent network technologies has ever more profound implications for humans and societies, and has triggered visions and initiatives to re-align the Next-Generation networks with what works for humans and humanity first. However, there is a mismatch between higher-level design intentions and reality in the context of human-centric intelligent network infrastructure, which calls for a shift and re-alignment of how human-centred theory is translated into technical configurations and practise. This P.h.D project outline investigates how future technology roadmaps can intertwine human-centric theory with the inner mechanics of IoT system technologies. In future research phases, innovation scenarios and breakthroughs are explored to direct the recommended technical specifications toward what is desirable for humanity's well-being that genuinely enhances human empowerment, with greater degrees of inclusivity, meaningful human control, and involvement.

Currently, traditional technologies are inadequate to support the requirement. It is vital to investigate cost-effective and suitable green environmental technologies as a response. Future connectivity(5G, 6G), programming, artificial intelligence and new technologies might be a resolution to this resource crisis in this setting. Now, choosing amongst the most suitable option present itself as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) challenge in which a judgment must be made in terms of a wide variety of characteristics. In this paper, the extended MCDM strategies are proposed to optimizing new technologies implementation. The novelty of the Fuzzy Hypersoft (FHS) set is discussed, which can deal with uncertainties, vagueness, and unclear data. This framework is more flexible than the structures found in literature as it can deal with the information where the attributes can be further sub-partitioned into attribute values for a better understanding. It may not always be possible to analyze these criteria using precise figures; instead, an assessment must be made using human and expert judgments for a more adaptable and sensitive review. The adaptive MCDM design with fuzzy edges incorporates Entropy (EN), Similarity Measure (SIM), and TOPSIS techniques rely on FHS. The conveyed frameworks are better for probing NT issues because they analyze a more expansive range of attributes, which can handle a component with multiple different sub-attribute values. Expert ratings are used to demonstrate a practical application to highlight the relevance of the proposed approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the impact of primary criterion weights in sorting.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3299861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196382","New technologies (NT);risk factors (RF);planning and development;multi-criteria decision making (MCDM);entropy (EN);similarity measures (SIM);fuzzy hypersoft set (FHS)","Decision making;Uncertainty;Risk management;Organizations;Fuzzy sets;Sorting;Merging;Technology planning;Entropy","artificial intelligence;data handling;decision making;entropy;fuzzy set theory;sensitivity analysis;TOPSIS","adaptable review;adaptive MCDM design;artificial intelligence;conveyed frameworks;expert judgments;extended MCDM strategies;FHS;framework incorporating Entropy;future connectivity;fuzzy edges;Fuzzy Hypersoft set;human judgments;increasing population;multicriteria decision making;multiple different sub-attribute values;new technology implementation;resource crisis;sensitive review;similarity measure;suitable green environmental technologies;technological advancements;technologies implementation;TOPSIS techniques;traditional technologies;unclear data","","","","79","CCBYNCND","28 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a new concept for smart manufacturing systems that are currently in use, who is the Digital Twin (DT) for manufacturing. It is a virtual reflection of a real element. It can be used to check the flexibility of the manufacturing layout, reproduce complex manufacturing systems and evaluate production efficiency in real time. The DT system allows us to test virtual scenarios, optimize and improve working conditions. It predict also what will happen in the real world. The application of DTs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is an important task. It has many advantages to improve the real-time status of machines and products. It ensures also, the continuity between the different areas of industry. The deployment of this concept in the manufacturing sector of an SME, requires the identification of techniques already deployed in the literature. In this paper, the main techniques used in the four layers of DTs, such as the cyber layer, the computing layer, physical layer, and the service layer are reviewed in detail. Their requirements and proposed solutions are also discussed. Another focus, is to provide a framework for the development of DTs for SMEs.

The top-level ontology defines generic application domain mediation concepts while task-level ontologies represent domain-related understanding. They are connected by semantic mappings, which provide top-level ontology as a mediator by translating the local schema to a common data model. A semi-automatic procedure that assists users to discover plausible semantic relationships between two types of ontology is introduced. Finally, we give an example from a product design scenario, which XML and RDF are chosen as standard syntax and semantic representing language respectively relying on the description and reasoning capabilities.","","978-1-4244-7386-1","10.1109/ICICIS.2010.5534777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534777","semantic conflicts;mediator;mapping transformation;two-level ontology-component","Ontologies;Collaboration;Collaborative tools;XML;Resource description framework;Collaborative work;Data models;Vocabulary;Data engineering;Design engineering","electronic data interchange;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;programming language semantics;XML","ontology based framework;semantic resolution;data exchange;interoperability;heterogeneous information sources;top level ontology;generic application domain mediation concepts;task level ontologies;domain related understanding;XML;RDF;semantic representing language","","","","9","IEEE","3 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing deep spectral convolutional networks (DSCNs) have made encouraging performance for FER based on a set of facial local regions and a predefined graph structure. However, these regions do not have close relationships to AUs, and DSCNs cannot model the dynamic spatial dependencies of these regions for estimating different facial expressions. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel double dynamic relationships graph convolutional network (DDRGCN) to learn the strength of the edges in the facial graph by a trainable weighted adjacency matrix. We construct facial graph data by 20 regions of interest (ROIs) guided by different facial AUs. Furthermore, we devise an efficient graph convolutional network in which the inherent dependencies of vertices in the facial graph can be learned automatically during network training. Notably, the proposed model only has 110K parameters and 0.48MB model size, which is significantly less than most existing methods. Experiments on four widely-used FER datasets demonstrate that the proposed dynamic relationships graph network achieves superior results compared to existing light-weight networks, not just in terms of accuracy but also model size and speed.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2021.3101820","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872188,61972204,61861136011,61902250,61976145,61802267); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509366","Facial expression recognition;dynamic relationship graph network;action units;light-weight network","Convolution;Face recognition;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Convolutional codes;Mouth;Gold","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);emotion recognition;face recognition;graph theory;image segmentation","facial expression recognition;facial action units analysis;deep spectral convolutional networks;facial local regions;predefined graph structure;facial graph data;network training;double dynamic relationships graph convolutional network;regions of interest","","7","","56","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the graphics processing unit(GPU) has a high degree of parallel computing capability, its energy consumption is large, and the data transmission is limited by the system bus bandwidth. Therefore, our laboratory previously proposed the Brain Memory Architecture prototype architecture, which integrates FPGA and memory as a computing architecture, which has the advantages of high-efficiency, and low-power computing and does not require data exchange through the system bus. Based on this prototype architecture, this paper constructs the Brain Memory Architecture HW/SW Co-Design Platform (BMCD platform) to provide a good user interface so that users can easily build a hardware and software collaborative design computing environment. Through the library provided by the platform to establish the data transmission and calculation between acceleration hardware and memory to solve the bandwidth limitation of the traditional system bus. In this platform, the AXI4-stream interconnect core is provided as a standard interface for data handshaking with acceleration hardware, which reduces user design complexity and maintains the scalability of connection with other computing IP cores. In platform evaluation, design and adaptive CNN algorithm for hardware and software design platform, provide data quantization methods to reduce data bits to reduce the required data bandwidth and storage space and propose a dynamic adjustment algorithm for integer and decimal ratios to correct the accuracy and design problems that may be caused by data quantization. With this adaptive CNN algorithm architecture and BMCD platform to construct a rapid data transmission. This paper finally analyzes the comparison of the weight transmission time of different CNN models with the CPU and the GPU.

Previous approaches to assess agreement grouped the gestures into equivalence classes and ignored the integral properties that are shared between them. In this article, we propose a generalized framework that inherently incorporates the gesture descriptors into the agreement analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, we represent gestures using binary description vectors and allow them to be partially similar. In this context, we introduce a new metric referred to as soft agreement rate (SAR) to measure the level of agreement and provide a mathematical justification for this metric. Furthermore, we perform computational experiments to study the behavior of SAR and demonstrate that existing agreement metrics are a special case of our approach. Our method is evaluated and tested through a guessability study conducted with a group of neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, our formulation can be applied to any other user-elicitation study. Results show that the level of agreement obtained by SAR is 2.64 times higher than the previous metrics.

These likes and dislikes are influenced by our psychographic attributes, morals, values, beliefs and societal networks in both circles of influence and circles of concern. We continuously consume products, services as well as produce products and services for others to consume. Due to our inherent bias of likes and dislikes, we unintentionally or intentionally end up liking products and/or services that are personalized for us, or somehow unintentionally match our likes. This personalization makes our lives easier and more comfortable as it may save time, and/or enable us to achieve desired experiences. This personalization is influenced by the data gathered about us directly or indirectly. The richer the data is about us, the more personalized products and services we receive, thereby saving us time and money whilst meeting our desired goals for experience or exchange of value for the offers we are wanting. We remain forever concerned about the direct or accidental use of our data that can fall into the hands of nefarious users of the dark web, or criminals who can cause us all kinds of harm using the data we shared. Herein lies the paradox of personalization and privacy. To solve this paradox, we acknowledge that there has to be a trade-off between data privacy and personalization, and an optimized match on trust, value etc. between the data owners (data subjects) and data buyers. In this paper, we propose approaches to handle these trade-offs in an optimized way with the acceptance threshold determined by a methodology to optimize the match between trust and value perceptions specific to an individual, and in context of the trust we place on the data controller, processor or buyer entity with which we share and entrust our data for the exchange of value provided.","2158-3412","978-1-6654-1507-1","10.1109/ISTAS50296.2020.9462236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462236","data privacy controls;data wealth asset management;personalization and services from data;sociotechnical systems;participatory design;human-technology interaction;experiment with values;data sharing marketplace;data locker;data wallet","Data privacy;Privacy;Ethics;Sensitivity;Roads;Process control;Data models","data privacy;Internet;security of data;social networking (online)","tesseract optimization;data privacy;sharing economics;psychographic attributes;societal networks;personalized products;value perceptions;data personalization;personalized services;dark web","","","","22","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Possible pathways for such a re-politicising of participation in design are discussed with concepts of Agonistic Design, Critical Design and Design in Use. Alongside these methodological concerns, I argue, it is necessary to also rethink our underlying theoretical understanding of the relationship between humans and technology.

However, interpreting human preferences and occupant behaviour as metrics to inform early design stages remains largely unexplored. Game engines’ are examined for their capacity to steer the design process and embed performance data. Furthermore, the virtual environments they enable are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively as tools for engaging with user preferences. The resultant metrics are then exported into architectural design software to be used as tools by the designer. Finally, the present context in which game engines are applied in architectural design is examined.

Wikipedians), we have collected a set of measures related to Wikipedia activity that, if available and visualized effectively, could spare a lot of monitoring time to these Wikipedians, allowing them to focus on quality and coverage of Wikipedia instead of spending their time navigating heavily to track vandals and copyright infringements. However, most of these measures cannot be computed on the fly using the available Wikipedia API. Therefore, we have designed an open architecture called WikiReactive to compute incrementally and maintain several aggregated measures on the French Wikipedia. This aggregated data is available as a Web Service and can be used to overlay information on Wikipedia articles through Wikipedia Skins or for new services for Wikipedians or people studying Wikipedia. This article describes the architecture, its performance and some of its uses.","","978-1-4244-9487-3","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5652896","Information Storage and Retrieval [H.3.5]: Online Information Services-Web-based services;Database Management [H.2.1]: Logical Design-Schema and subschema;Database Management [H.2.4]: System-Query processing","Encyclopedias;Internet;Electronic publishing;Data visualization;Databases;Measurement","application program interfaces;data visualisation;query processing;Web services","real-time aggregation;Wikipedia data;visual analytics;encyclopedic knowledge;collaborative social process;participatory design sessions;copyright infringements;Wikipedia API;WikiReactive;French Wikipedia;Web Service;Wikipedia skins;Wikipedia articles","","11","","23","IEEE","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a mobile serious game proposal, called “Protecting the Earth”, about selective waste collection, recycling, reduction of waste production and waste reuse in different game stages with focuses in childish public. The methodology adopted included Systematic Review; application of Participatory Design methods, such as the Context Inquiry technique; specification of functional and non-functional requirements and the study of technologies appropriate for developing the project. Experiments were conducted with children aiming to assess the proposed tool's interface. The results obtained by means of usability testing with users showed the need for adjustments in the interface in order to achieve greater accessibility and user satisfaction, and were met immediately. The next step is to perform learning evaluation experiments in order to verify if the proposed serious game is collaborating to acquire user knowledge about the study object (Environmental Education).","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757353","serious game;environmentally sustainable;Three-Dimensional Virtual Learning Environment;Environmental Awareness of Children","Games;Three-dimensional displays;Education;Mobile communication;Recycling;Chemical elements;Proposals","environmental science computing;formal specification;mobile computing;serious games (computing)","mobile serious game proposal;children environmental awareness;waste accumulation;sidewalk;public square;environmental problem;urban infrastructure;citizen participation;Protecting the Earth;selective waste collection;recycling;waste production reduction;waste reuse;systematic review;participatory design method;context inquiry technique;functional requirement specification;tool interface;usability testing;user satisfaction;learning evaluation experiment;environmental education","","8","","21","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational methods and formal representations of knowledge usually neglect this kind of individual variation. We have developed a novel method, Grounded Intersubjective Concept Analysis (GICA), for the analysis and visualization of individual differences in language use and conceptualization. The GICA method first employs a conceptual survey or a text mining step to elicit from varied groups of individuals the particular ways in which terms and associated concepts are used among the individuals. The subsequent analysis and visualization reveals potential underlying groupings of subjects, objects and contexts. One way of viewing the GICA method is to compare it with the traditional word space models. In the word space models, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), statistical analysis of word-context matrices reveals latent information. A common approach is to analyze term-document matrices in the analysis. The GICA method extends the basic idea of the traditional term-document matrix analysis to include a third dimension of different individuals. This leads to a formation of a third-order tensor of size subjects × objects × contexts. Through flattening into a matrix, these subject-object-context (SOC) tensors can again be analyzed using various computational methods including principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA) or any existing or future method suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In order to demonstrate the use of the GICA method, we present the results of two case studies. In the first case, GICA of health-related concepts is conducted. In the second one, the State of the Union addresses by US presidents are analyzed. In these case studies, we apply multidimensional scaling (MDS), the self-organizing map (SOM) and Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) as specific data analysis methods within the overall GICA method. The GICA method can be used, for instance, to support education of heterogeneous audiences, public planning processes and participatory design, conflict resolution, environmental problem solving, interprofessional and interdisciplinary communication, product development processes, mergers of organizations, and building enhanced knowledge representations in semantic web.","2161-4407","978-1-4673-1490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252765","","Context;Tensile stress;Educational institutions;Pragmatics;Color;Humans;Electronic mail","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;independent component analysis;information retrieval;knowledge representation;principal component analysis;self-organising feature maps;semantic Web;singular value decomposition;text analysis","GICA method;epistemological subjectivity quantification;formal knowledge representations;grounded intersubjective concept analysis;text mining step;visualization;word space models;latent semantic analysis;statistical analysis;word-context matrices;term-document matrix analysis;subject-object-context tensors;principal component analysis;PCA;SOC;singular value decomposition;SVD;independent component analysis;(ICA);multidimensional scaling;MDS;self-organizing map;neighborhood retrieval visualizer;NeRV;data analysis methods;public planning processes;participatory design;conflict resolution;environmental problem solving;product development processes;semantic Web","","5","4","22","IEEE","30 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we present a conceptual model of concepts involved in public interest technology design, and specify a metaplatform that could be used to implement such designs.

Contrary to the ways in which improvisation is generally used in social robotics, we propose an understanding of improvisational techniques as based on rules that shape motion choices. We claim that such an approach, represented in what we name the “external” and “emergent” perspectives on improvisation, could benefit the way in which robot movement and behaviour is designed and deployed, increasing playful engagement and responsiveness. As an example of this type of improvisation, we discuss how American dancer and choreographer William Forsythe's Improvisation Technologies could be used in an HRI context. We also report on a preliminary experimentation using a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory prototyping system and a participatory design method with professional dancers geared towards the exploration of interactive movement possibilities with a Pepperrobot.

Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins.

This paper proposes a multidimensional holistic framework that addresses this gap through advanced technologies, intelligent algorithms, and continued assessments. To show proof, the layered defense model, a solution dimension of the framework, is integrated into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Security and Resilience Testbed to replicate a utility's enterprise and substation networks. The model is used to evaluate the security and resilience of microgrid control systems, and, based on the insights gathered, recommend best practices for utility cybersecurity analysts for a strong business process.

Deciding which feature requests require attention and how much upfront analysis to perform on them is an important problem in this context: too little upfront analysis may result in inadequate functionalities being developed, costly changes, and wasted development effort; too much upfront analysis is a waste of time and resources. Early predictions about which feature requests are most likely to fail due to insufficient or inadequate upfront analysis could facilitate such decisions. Our objective is to study whether it is possible to make such predictions automatically from the characteristics of the online discussions on feature requests. The paper presents a tool-implemented framework that automatically constructs failure prediction models using machine-learning classification algorithms and compares the performance of the different techniques for the Firefox and Netbeans projects. The comparison relies on a cost-benefit model for assessing the value of additional upfront analysis. In this model, the value of additional upfront analysis depends on its probability of success in preventing failures and on the relative cost of the failures it prevents compared to its own cost. We show that for reasonable estimations of these two parameters automated prediction models provide more value than a set of baselines for some failure types and projects. This suggests that automated failure prediction during online requirements elicitation may be a promising approach for guiding requirements engineering efforts in online settings.","2332-6441","978-1-4577-0924-1","10.1109/RE.2011.6051658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051658","Early failure prediction;Cost-benefit of requirements engineering;Feature requests management systems;Global software development;Open source","Predictive models;Fires;Analytical models;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Mathematical model","formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","early failure prediction;online feature request management systems;machine-learning classification algorithms;cost-benefit model;requirements engineering","","12","","23","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this study is to obtain a data model that allows us to evaluate the goodness of the MR system compared to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools (in this case LEGO bricks) which acts as the control condition. In this paper we present our first analysis of the arousal generated by the MR experience compared to that generated in the control condition. We address this by analyzing psychophysiological data recorded during the social interaction behaviors in the ASD child while playing with the non-ASD child. We followed a repeated-measures design with two conditions: our full-body interaction MR environment and the typical social intervention strategy based on LEGO bricks. To measure physiology, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Accelerometer (ACC) data were acquired through a wearable designed by our lab. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the huge amount of multimodal data from the ASD children obtained during 18 trials (3 female and 15 male). As a result, we were capable of classifying social initiation behaviors of ASD children during the MR environment sessions and those occurring during the LEGO construction sessions based on the psycho-physiological data sources. This is a first sign showing that our MR system has specific properties, compared to a traditional construction-based intervention, which potentially provide a new interesting context to intervention in ASD.","2156-8111","978-1-7281-3888-6","10.1109/ACII.2019.8925474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925474","Autism Spectrum Condition;Mixed Reality;Embodied Interaction;Social Initiation;Arousal;Psychophysiology;Computational Modeling","Variable speed drives;Virtual reality;Pediatrics;Physiology;Electrodes;Autism;Electrocardiography","behavioural sciences;electrocardiography;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;physiology;psychology;virtual reality","ECG;electrocardiogram;EDA;electrodermal activity;accelerometer;machine learning;full-body interactive mixed reality experience;social intervention strategy;multi-modal data;construction-based intervention;psycho-physiological data sources;LEGO construction sessions;ASD children;repeated-measures design;social interaction behaviors;control condition;data model;nonASD child;face-to-face play session;autism spectrum disorder;social initiation;computational modeling","","2","","50","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, a literature review on technological innovation features is conducted to recognize potential gaps in ongoing research. Cloud computing is altering the way goods are developed, allowing for greater collaboration between corporate IT and other business divisions such as sales, finance, and forecasting, and encouraging increased customerinvolvement, even to the point of collaboratively designing products with customers. The unique insights provided by the findings can aid businesses in improving their cloud computing usage and deeplearning. Big data and machine-learning capabilities are becoming more available from cloud computing, in addition to primary processing and storage. Due to the relationship between deep learning and the cloud, the firm gains competitive advantages that speed up processes and procedures, placing it on par with the market's key competitors and making it more strategically competitive and technologically well-organized. However, deep learning with the cloud cantransform business in productivity and efficiency to fulfil its commitment. This collaboration increases the company's ability to identify commercial opportunities by offering a comprehensive, well-defined, aggressive, and limitless (thanks to the cloud) database to manageand use strategically. Furthermore, the relationship between deep learning and cloud computing has acommercial impact since it enables automatic transaction identification and allocation, anomalydetection, and the ongoing development of predictive solutions. A cloud environment learns from the data itgathers, makes predictions, and fixes possible issuesbefore the user even realises they exist. These developments lead the company to recognise that cloudcomputing and deep learning are becoming increasingly entwined.","","978-1-6654-6643-1","10.1109/ICIPTM54933.2022.9754046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754046","Cloud computing;Deep learning;Technology;Organizational commitment;Data","Deep learning;Productivity;Cloud computing;Technological innovation;Costs;Collaboration;Companies","Big Data;business data processing;cloud computing;customer relationship management;deep learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;product design;productivity;transaction processing","cloud computing;machine-learning capabilities;cloud environment;deep learning;technical capacity;organizational commitment;environmental components;organizational components;company commitment;organizational characteristics;literature review;technological innovation;corporate IT;customer involvement;collaborative product design;big data;competitive advantage;productivity;commercial opportunities;anomaly detection;automatic transaction identification","","1","","20","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The steady improvement of Internet-of-Things technologies, or of the recently phrased cyber physical systems, during the last years ensures this process transparency. Although these technologies are promising, the potential of IoT/CPS technologies is not yet fully applied in practice. One reason is that technology novices have difficulties participating in development processes and consequently prevent case-specific and relevant services from being described. This paper presents an adaptive interface approach to support the development and utilization of IoT solutions. An exemplary solution is presented based on an IoT toolkit with a GUI for configuration, making service development possible without coding skills. Based on experiment observations, design improvements of the GUI are implemented. Furthermore, a more sophisticated design is introduced. This will allow users with different competence levels to improve their interaction with sensor and actuator networks further; consequently, more appropriate solutions can be developed and used.","","978-1-4799-4735-5","10.1109/ICE.2014.6871591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871591","IoT;CPS;adaptive interface;collaborative design;sensor networks","Graphical user interfaces;Software;Conferences;Context;Programming;Hardware","Internet of Things;software engineering;user interfaces","adaptive interfaces;IoT service development;cyber-physical systems;competence based user interfaces;Internet-of-Things technologies;CPS technologies;GUI;service development;actuator networks;sensor networks","","4","","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such an environment there is a need for computational frameworks that assist in communicating decision making knowledge. In this research a Decision Support Ontology (DSO) is developed to facilitate decision making within collaborative design. The structure of the information model developed reflects a priori knowledge of decision making and supports the communication of information independent of any specific decision method. Accordingly, the DSO includes decision-related information such as the design issue, alternatives, evaluation, criteria and preferences. It also includes decision rationale and assumptions, as well as any constraints created by the decision and the decision outcome. The DSO is built upon the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which facilitates the sharing and integration of decision-making information between multiple collaborators via the Web and Description Logic. Although the information model developed is based on engineering design literature, the DSO captures generic decision information, and therefore could be adapted to be used beyond the engineering design domain.","","978-1-4244-4584-4","10.1109/CTS.2009.5067456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5067456","decision support;knowledge management;ontology;semantic framework","Ontologies;Collaboration;Decision making;Design engineering;OWL;Logic;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management;Product development;Semantic Web","CAD;decision support systems;groupware;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","decision support ontology;collaborative decision making;engineering design;decision-related information;Web ontology language;description logic","","23","","48","IEEE","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates how a collaborative design process was used at a technology consultancy company to design a service aimed at enabling data transparency and control as well as at communicating its value. We collected qualitative data from a survey, interviews, and workshops conducted with employees. We then built a prototype and tested its usability using a questionnaire. Results showed a clear need among participants for transparency. Results also showed the effectiveness of the prototype in positively enhancing transparency and in generating a good level of usability. The adopted process also led to the formulation of data categories to improve the service's comprehensiveness.

In contrast, this paper argues that software algorithms and hardware architectures affect each other in neural network applications with a high degree of coupling. In this paper, we propose a software and hardware-based co-optimization design to improve CNNs’ processing efficiency by co-optimization of software and hardware. First, a modular analysis and collaborative design are carried out for the ShuffleNetV2 model by implementing quantization and improving the computational unit. Second, the model is optimized based on reconfigurable computing devices for its characteristics. Third, 8 bit quantization is implemented, while the depth-separable convolution operation and channel selection module is redesigned to make the module perform operations in a hardware-friendly form. The experimental work was carried out on the FPGA platform Xilin xzynqxc-7Z045 using High Level Synthesis (HLS).

The validity of this comparison is supported by medical expert knowledge gathered for the purpose of this study. This investigation has uncovered that these explanation methods both possess appropriateness for ADE explanations and may be used complementarily, due to SHAP providing more clinically appropriate global explanations and attention mechanisms capturing more clinically appropriate local explanations. Additional feedback from medical experts reveal that SHAP may be more applicable to real-time clinical encounters, in which efficiency must be prioritised, over attention explanations which possess properties more appropriate for offline analyses.","2372-9198","978-1-6654-4121-6","10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474699","Explainable AI;Attention Mechanisms;SHAP;Adverse Drug Events","Drugs;Recurrent neural networks;Computer architecture;Real-time systems","data analysis;drugs;medical computing;medical expert systems;medical information systems;neural net architecture;recurrent neural nets","clinical validity;SHAP temporal explanations;adverse drug event prediction;attention mechanisms;recurrent neural network based architectures;sufficiently valid medical explanations;medical problem;RNN;post-hoc SHAP framework;medical expert knowledge;explanation methods;ADE explanations;global explanations;local explanations;medical experts;real-time clinical encounters;attention explanations;attention-based temporal explanations","","2","","15","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the immediate future, it is likely that human workers will continue to use and direct these autonomous robots, much like other computerised tools but with more sophisticated decision-making. Therefore, one important area on which to focus engineering effort is ensuring that these users trust the system. Recent literature suggests that explainability is closely related to how trustworthy a system is. Like safety and security properties, explainability should be designed into a system, instead of being added afterwards. This paper presents an abstract architecture that supports an autonomous system explaining its behaviour (explainable autonomy), providing a design template for implementing explainable autonomous systems.

Blockchain technology has evolved to address the confidentiality and other technical issues that come with using distributed databases. It offers a decentralized environment for processing the transactions, establishes trust among the nodes participating in the network, and also removes the use of central third-party authority. The blockchain contains information on every transaction and is completely change-resistant. It offers peer-to-peer networks in which all nodes are able to validate the transactions happening in the network using a consensus mechanism.

XAI acknowledges the importance of human factors and strives to incorporate them into the design process, recognising that the cognitive effort involved in understanding explanations is a key aspect. Mental Models play a crucial role in the XAI evaluative premise, but their current utility is limited.

However, considering the efficiency and value creation of the entire supply chain, it is important to promote a smart factory in not only large companies but also SMEs. This study examines the success factors and mechanisms based on the case studies of Japanese SMEs that have successfully implemented smart factories. Then, its characteristics are compared with those of large companies. Specifically, in SMEs, where the top management and the factory floor are in close proximity, if the purposes and vision of DT are clear and the top management understands its possibilities and limitations, successful experiences can spread throughout the company through trial and error using an in-house system optimized for the factory floor. This study reveals that the success mechanism makes it easier for SMEs to promote DX than for large companies under certain conditions, which is a new finding and a theoretical contribution. The practical contribution of this study is that it guides SMEs to promote DT in factories in SMEs based on this mechanism.","","978-1-6654-2769-2","10.1109/TEMSCON-ASPAC52831.2022.9916539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916539","smart factory;digital transformation;small and medium-sized enterprises;success factor;success mechanism","Leadership;Engineering management;Supply chains;Companies;Production facilities;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence","factory automation;Internet of Things;small-to-medium enterprises;supply chains","success mechanism;smart factory;digital transformation;value creation;supply chain;Japanese SME;factory floor;small and medium-sized enterprises","","","","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spatial distribution of recreational activities in Owyhee county are modeled by Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST). Land use and cover change (LUCC) are simulated using Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN). Results show that the tele-coupling effects have significant impacts on the nature-based recreation in Owyhee county. With the tele-coupling effects, MLPNN has achieved a high overall accuracy and kappa coefficient in LUCC. The findings suggest that the tele-coupling effects should be incorporated into the modeling of landscape change and SES.

Due to spectrum scarcity, there has been a growing trend among stakeholders toward identifying practical solutions to make the most productive use of the exclusively allocated bands on a shared basis through spectrum sharing mechanisms. However, due to the technical complexities of these mechanisms, their design presents challenges, as it requires coordination among multiple entities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we begin with a detailed review of the recent literature on spectrum sharing methods, classifying them on the basis of their operational frequency regime—that is, whether they are implemented to operate in licensed bands (e.g., licensed shared access (LSA), spectrum access system (SAS), and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS)) or unlicensed bands (e.g., LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U), licensed assisted access (LAA), MulteFire, and new radio-unlicensed (NR-U)). Then, in order to narrow the gap between the standardization and vendor-specific implementations, we provide a detailed review of the potential implementation scenarios and necessary amendments to legacy cellular networks from the perspective of telecommunication vendors and regulatory bodies. Next, we analyze applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for facilitating spectrum sharing mechanisms and leveraging the full potential of autonomous sharing scenarios. Finally, we conclude the paper by presenting open research challenges, which aim to provide insights into prospective research endeavors.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2023.3238569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026262","Spectrum sharing;MNO;LSA;SAS;LTE-U;LAA;MulteFire;NR-U","5G mobile communication;Synthetic aperture sonar;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Industrial Internet of Things;Economics;Broadband communication;Wireless networks","4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;next generation networks;radio access networks;radio spectrum management","autonomous sharing scenarios;current frequency bands;design presents challenges;exclusively allocated bands;legacy cellular networks;licensed bands;LTE-unlicensed;mobile network operators;new radio;next-generation wireless networks;operational frequency regime-that;protocol flow;shared basis;spectrum access system;spectrum scarcity;spectrum sharing mechanisms;spectrum sharing methods;spectrum sharing schemes;U/el;unlicensed bands","","2","","237","CCBY","25 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work.

In our previously developed catalogue of NFRs conflicts it can be observed that a number of specific pairs of NFRs are claimed to be in conflicts in some cases but they are also claimed not to be in conflict in the other cases. These relative conflicts occur because the positive or negative relationships among NFRs are not always clear and obvious. These relationships might change depending on the meaning of NFRs within the system being developed. This paper focuses on the application of ontology in managing the relative conflicts among NFRs, particularly the relative conflicts between security and usability requirements. The aim is to develop a framework to identify, characterize, and define corresponding resolution strategies for the security-usability conflicts. This paper thus describes the sureCM framework to manage these conflicts; summarizes the security-usability conflicts ontology; and demonstrates how the ontology will be used as a basis to assist analysts in managing conflicts between security and usability requirements.","","978-1-4244-8784-4","10.1109/MARK.2010.5623814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623814","non-functional requirements;conflicts;relative;framework;management;ontology;security;usability","Ontologies;Usability;Security;Context;Knowledge based systems;Software engineering","formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","ontological framework;relative conflicts management;usability requirements;nonfunctional requirements;security-usability conflicts;sureCM framework","","20","","41","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To better support real-time wireless services, the low-latency communication is the current research focus. However, the existing radio resource scheduling methods cannot guarantee the strict delay constraint of the low-latency communication. Therefore, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach of radio spectrum resource scheduling strategy is proposed, which can guarantee the low-latency constraint when spectrum resources are insufficient. The Q-learning algorithm is used to approximate the optimal goal of RL. To speed up the learning, the deep neural network (DNN) is used to train the learning parameters. Simulation results show that the strategy converges quickly and has satisfactory results for mobile networks with a high load of spectrum resources.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-9484-4","10.1109/VTC2020-Fall49728.2020.9348718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348718","5G;low-latency communication;reinforcement learning;spectrum scheduling;Q-learning;DNN","Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Simulation;Neural networks;Reinforcement learning;Delays;Low latency communication","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;resource allocation;scheduling","real-time wireless services;low-latency communication;existing radio resource scheduling methods;reinforcement learning approach;radio spectrum resource scheduling strategy;spectrum resources;Q-learning algorithm;learning parameters;mobile networks;5G resource scheduling","","6","","19","IEEE","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, automating the CXR image processing for early disease diagnosis is crucial for radiologists. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, used to discriminate between positive and negative cases. In addition, the flip, rotation, zoom and shift operations were used to augment the dataset size. Finally, the model was trained and tested on COVIDx CXR-2 dataset.

An important point is the reduction of the energy demand of production plants. Instead of manually implementing complex standby strategies rigidly in a PLC, an intelligent system can train to derive decisions about the optimal energetic state of each component autonomously. Since learning in a virtual environment has decisive advantages, simulation models with sufficient accuracy are necessary. Many of the previous implementations of reinforcement learning approaches in an industrial environment are usually tailored to a specific plant. In particular, the agent's scope of action and its connection to the environment must be adapted manually for a new plant.

The objective of the PLM business activity is to manage products across their lifecycles, from cradle to grave. PLM is focused on the product, and holistically brings together many product-related components. For such environments, ontologies could play an important role to ensure semantic interoperability and correct information exchange. But what kinds of ontologies are best suited to fulfil this task. The work presented in this paper overviews some of the prominent ontologies used in product development and explores the usefulness of some typical known ontologies for PLM needs. The ontologies are assessed with respect to some ontology engineering and PLM key criteria. By identifying positive and negative aspects with respect to the previous criteria, we clarify the range of alternatives in creating an ontology devoted to PLM purposes.","","978-1-5090-0599-4","10.1109/ICE.2006.7477092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477092","PLM ontologies;product knowledge management;semantic interoperability","Semantics;Gears;Standards;Ontologies","ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;product life cycle management;production engineering computing","critical analysis;product development environments;product lifecycle management;PLM business activity;product-related components;semantic interoperability;information exchange;ontology engineering;PLM key criteria","","4","","9","IEEE","2 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Requirements engineering is a creative problem-solving process whose primary purpose is to enable researchers and practitioners to apply appropriate theories, models, techniques and tools to understand and support the requirements processes more effectively. However, there is a multitude of ways to conduct the requirements engineering process and the quality of the requirements can be greatly influenced by the approaches employed. While consensus exists that no one approach works in all situations, how do practitioners and researchers select the most relevant and appropriate approach(es)? In order to understand this, we argue that a community-based effort is required to organise the plethora of requirements engineering approaches into an ontology. Such a structure would provide an opportunity to identify gaps and to improve the interfaces between approaches. Crowdsourcing the development and validation of such an ontology would facilitate its application across different system types and application domains.","2332-6441","978-1-7281-3912-8","10.1109/RE.2019.00080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920553","Requirements-Engineering;Community-based-Requirements-Engineering;Crowdsourcing;Ontology;Methods;Tools;Techniques;Approaches","Requirements engineering;Ontologies;Tools;Crowdsourcing;Software;Industries;Collaboration","formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);problem solving;software reliability;systems analysis","ontology;system development process;creative problem-solving process;requirements engineering process","","1","","16","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a context-aware, ambient aware and pervasive framework is proposed that tackles this integration problem by using an ontology. Rules, defined on top of this ontology, implement algorithms to optimize and automate care tasks. To increase the acceptance of the new technology, a user-driven development process is used which involves the stakeholders in every step of the design of the ontology and algorithms.

With the emergence of ontologies as a new modeling paradigm in industry during the last decade, efficient integration and semantic interoperability among all the inter-actors of the extended enterprise have become attainable. In fact, in addition to their great expressiveness, ontologies can afford many reasoning capabilities. In this paper, a reference ontology, general enough to represent both the product and supply chain data and specific enough to support the decision making process in the simultaneous design phase, has been proposed and implemented. In addition, we have exploited its potentialities through the proposition of a new integrating approach based on the dynamic interaction between ontology and mathematical models of optimization, in order to support interoperability and the optimization process within the simultaneous design of the product and its related supply chain.","","978-1-4673-8571-8","10.1109/GOL.2016.7731662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7731662","Ontologies;Concurrent design;Supply chain;Optimization;Semantic interoperability;Integration","Ontologies;Supply chains;Collaboration;Mathematical model;Optimization;Data models","decision making;ontologies (artificial intelligence);product design;supply chain management","reference ontology;product design;supply chain optimization;modeling paradigm;semantic interoperability;reasoning capabilities;decision making process;simultaneous design phase;integrating approach;dynamic interaction;mathematical models","","","","18","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to enrich our model with tacit expert knowledge guiding the checking process, we develop special (semi)formal expert rules based on semantic annotations of conformity queries that schedule the matching operations of the checking process and, thus, make it more effective.

Separation of concerns in the aspect oriented software development (AOSD) allows architects to structure and developers to better manage complex systems by mapping the whole system in a multi-concern space and focusing one problem at a time. Certainly, there is a lot of confusion in AOSD about what a concern is. In this context, we defined as more precisely as possible the concern concept in information engineering. From our point of view, a concern is a care of one or more stakeholders involved in the construction or evolution of an information system in its natural environment. In order to make accurate the meaning of the concern concept, in this paper we introduce CONO (CONcerns Ontology), an ontology of the concern concept, which formally describes its meaning as we gave in our definition. Each concern might be described by its high-level specification that is a description formed by the problem specification of the concern and the roles of the stakeholders, which have that concern. The concepts from the high-level specifications constitute the stakeholders' vocabulary and can be used in the construction of an ontology of the new information system.","","978-0-85358-244-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462064","Information systems;modeling;taxonomy;ontology","Stakeholders;Ontologies;Information systems;Organizations;Production;Context;Taxonomy","aspect-oriented programming;formal specification;information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","ontologies;system complexity management;aspect oriented software development;AOSD;information engineering;information system;CONO;concerns ontology;high-level specification","","","","16","","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a case study of constructing ontology in support of e-government initiatives for development projects monitoring in a SSA country. Case studies of development projects conducted in different SSA countries as well as related published works in various fields including project management, project monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building are reviewed and the features of the ontology are extracted. The resulting ontology aims at: providing developers of potential e-government applications for development projects monitoring in Sub Saharan Africa and the developing world in large with key concepts and activities of the domain, facilitating communication amongst all the role players involved in development projects implementation by providing a common and shared representation of concepts and activities of the domain, and serving as a knowledge base system to the monitoring and evaluation activities of development projects; thereby, strengthening efficiency, effective and sustainable implementation of development projects in Sub Saharan Africa.

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines.

This paper contributes by helping to bridge the gap between ethical theory and design practice. To do so, the concept of capability caution in UAV design is introduced. Capability caution in UAV design is the need for setting well-reasoned limits to the technology's capabilities during the design phase, both to limit risks of misuse, but also to enhance performance within the specified application. Five capability caution design principles are developed which should be considered: 1. context of use 2. privacy 3. jobs and human skills 4. safety, security, and misuse, and 5. the future.

A design ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a design domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base. It can help the collaborative design team by providing accurate design information and guidelines. This research develops a methodology called domain knowledge acquisition process (DKAP) for creating an ontology of product and process design using IDEF5 and generates a consistency matrix for checking the accuracy of captured information. DKAP is a step-by-step methodology, which captures the product & process design knowledge, stores this knowledge in a reusable format, and shares this knowledge across enterprises.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a phased hybrid algorithm to accelerate the enumeration task of subgraph matching, called PH-CF, based on the CPU-field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) heterogeneous platform. This approach can make full use of the pipeline and data flow mechanism, low power consumption, and configurable characteristics of FPGA. First, the matching order of query vertices automatically selects GraphQL (GQL) or RI methods according to the sparsity of the data (query) graph. Second, a candidate vertex auxiliary data structure set partitioning method is designed to effectively realize the load balance of multiple computing units at the FPGA and CPU host sides. Third, FPGA's pipeline and data flow mechanism is used to accelerate the enumeration phase of subgraph matching. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the performance of the PH-CF outperforms the state-of-the-arts. PH-CF can obtain the average performance improvement of up to $16.07\times$, $38.61\times$, and $11.46\times$ over CFL, CECI, and DP-iso, respectively.

Smart Homes (SHs), as an instance of the ambient assisted living technology, can help reduce these expenses. However, only few of the existing studies in the literature discuss how SHs should be designed by considering the unique requirements of PwDs. Most of the studies view dementia care as a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific needs of PwDs. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems to PwDs as well as other stakeholders in the sector of dementia care. The present research reports on the requirements elicitation, design and evaluation of a dedicated SH prototype for PwDs. In contrast to most of the existing SH systems proposed for PwDs, this work presents a tailored prototype that is based on a user-centred design methodology. The preliminary evaluation by a sample of stakeholders shows the suitability of the proposed methodology and consequently the resulting prototype for reducing care difficulties as well as its potential of deployment in the real-world environment.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-8845-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552084","Smart Homes;Dementia Care;Assisted living;Healthcare;Ambient intelligence;Human interfaces;Artificial intelligence","Dementia;Prototypes;Monitoring;Interviews;Software;Stakeholders;User centered design","health care;medical computing;medical disorders;user centred design","user-centred design methodology;SHs;smart homes;healthcare systems;PwDs;people with dementia;care costs","","7","","40","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple systematic reviews have established a base set of findings which are now broadly taken as assumptions in the field. The findings have outlined frameworks, integration patterns, distinctions between product and process oriented digital twins, simulation and the leveraging of artificial intelligence to support prediction and optimisation. As the use cases of digital twins have evolved from a predominance in manufacturing and into the sociotechnical domain to support the social world, a gap emerges between the social requirements and the technical machinery of digital twins. This gap is significant and worthy of exploration as it presents important challenges for digital twin research including use of sociotechnical design methods, problems arising from a so-called abstraction gap and various epistemological concerns.

We have critically reviewed the existing approaches to automate the design of 3D environments. It was identified that current 3D environment generation techniques being specific to one or few types of environments and the lack of customizable frameworks which are common to many types of environments as the main issues to be addressed. According to literature, surprisingly complex and interesting global behaviours can arise in multi agent systems as a result of simple rules that are followed by number of simple agents operate in an environment. We hypothesize that this emergent behaviour of multi agent systems can be used to design 3D game environments with emergence properties that were not visible in initial constituents. The proposed solution provides a multi agent based approach to develop a framework which is common to design many types of 3D game environments. Each 3D model in a 3D game environment is associated with an agent with simple rules and this system allows users to introduce new 3D models and associate them with agent types. The main input for the proposed system is a parameterized description of an imaginary 3D environment. Output of the system is a 3D game environment with self organized 3D models positioned and oriented in most suitable places. The proposed approach has been evaluated by implementing a prototype and comparing the proposed approach with traditional 3D game environment design approaches.","","978-1-4673-5530-8","10.1109/ICTer.2012.6422829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422829","Multi Agent Systems;3D Game Development;Game Design;Artificial Intelligence;Emergent Intelligence","Games;Ear;Ontologies","computer games;multi-agent systems","multiagent based approach;design process;3D game environments;video game industry;parameterized description;imaginary 3D environment","","1","","25","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most companies, at least in the domain of industrial robotics, tend to rely on a Technology Push-based methodology. They develope a product as good as they can, trying to include their newest technological breakthroughs. When the product is finished, they advertise and sell it based on its feature set and competitive advantage. Unfortunately, this sometimes doesn't really take into account the desires and needs of (esp.) new markets. Hence, we applied a Market Pull-based approach: Use Case Driven Requirements Engineering (UCD-RE), starting with the analysis of Megatrends to understand future market developments. So far, no earlier evidence of such an approach for the development of a robotics product could be found in literature. As commonly agreed, Megatrends will affect our lives both professionally and in private, bringing huge business opportunities for companies - but only in the long run as their effects are relatively limited in the beginning. Yet, their effects will finally even break down encrusted structures and will make outdated business models obsolete. Therefore, new market entries or established companies that want a strategic reorientation have to focus firstly on the megatrends as they must understand the impact of the changes induced will have on customers. The company then must define which requirements and competencies are needed as well as which conditions have to be fulfilled to provide these customers with solutions resp. products and services. In our paper we outline the following approach: Firstly, we identified the most relevant Megatrends affecting the Consumer Robotics domain, then we derived a Use Case(s) and finally we outlined the overview of the necessary conditions and requirements to ensure a success story.","1543-9259","978-1-7281-1213-8","10.1109/INES46365.2019.9109533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109533","robotics;automation;artificial intelligence;ai;futurist research;future of robotics;megatrends;product development;requirements engineering;use case driven development;market analysis;service robotics;consumer robotics;future of work;robotic natives;sustainable development;sustainable technology","","advertising;customer services;industrial robots;product development;strategic planning;systems analysis","industrial robotics;consumer robotics;use case based requirements engineering;product development;technology push-based methodology;advertisement;market pull-based approach;UCD-RE;business models;strategic reorientation;customer services","","1","","20","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual assistant is very helpful especially for elder as well as for people with cognitive disability such as Alzheimer's disease. For someone with physical limitations, a virtual assistant can be very useful. Seniors with poor vision or limited mobility, for example, one can operate the device simply by speaking into it. New techniques of caring for the elderly that include advanced information and communication technology are desperately required. As a percentage of the total population, the world's senior population is rapidly growing, but the fraction of the working population who will create the resources to assist the aged is declining. Voice searches have a number of advantages for elders as well as for cognitive disability such as speed. In fact, voice searches are much faster than written searches. A survey has been carried out in this work in which some questions have been asked from elderly people and people with abnormality or disability. The questions were based on Virtual Assistant. The aim of this task was to evaluate how many people use these assistants in their everyday life.

Several supply chain risk management approaches have been revisited or reapplied in the literature; however, collaborative resource sharing is less researched. This study aimed to investigate the current academic state of the art and advances in using collaborative resource sharing as a reactive method to facilitate supply chain recovery in the presence of disruptive events. More specifically we considered the role of different collaborative resource-sharing strategies that organizations can adopt to support supply chain functionalities during times of disruption. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2000 to 2022. In order to analyze the literature, we adopted a combination of text-mining, automatic and manual categorization of selected articles, and exploratory analyses such as cluster analysis and relational indicators. We also consider the machine learning classification algorithm i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering for the categorization of clusters. The findings show that, for disruptive risks, collaborative sharing of labour and material resources is effective for the recovery of supply chains. More so, labour resources tend to contribute more to the recovery of supply chains through the physical and mental recreation of recovery activities and experiences. Whilst information resources and a mix of information and material resources are highly important in reducing the impact of COVID-19 disruptive supply chain risk. In conclusion, collaborating on the three resources, namely labour, material, and information resources can be an effective post-disruption recovery strategy for supply chains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9931114","Supply chain risk;supply chain disruption;collaborative recovery;collaborative resource sharing;hierarchical clustering;cluster analysis","Collaboration;Supply chains;Resource management;Systematics;Risk management;Clustering methods;Supply chain management","data mining;labour resources;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;risk management;supply chain management","material resources;labour resources;information resources;COVID-19 disruptive supply chain risk;effective post-disruption recovery strategy;collaborative resource sharing;supply chain recovery;systematic literature review;chain disruptions;disruptive events;different collaborative resource-sharing strategies;supply chain functionalities;disruptive risks;collaborative sharing","","1","","195","CCBY","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper follows grounded theory principles to elicit knowledge related to Trust, Ethics, and Transparency. We approach these qualities as Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), aiming to build catalogs to subsidize the construction of Socially Responsible Software. The corpus we have used was built on a selected collection of literature on Corporate Social Responsibility, with an emphasis on Business Ethics. Our challenge is how to encode the social perspective knowledge, mainly through the view of Corporate Social Responsibility, on how organizations or institutions achieve trustworthiness. Since our ground perspective is that of NFRs, results are presented by a catalogue of Trust as a Non-Functional Requirement, represented as a Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG).

Inspired by embodied artificial intelligence and modular robotics, we present the building block approach as a way to achieve user-driven innovation of high tech solutions with a social impact. Modularity invites to physical manipulation and reconfiguration, and in the process of physical manipulation, the user starts understanding and developing the functionality. Through immediate action in the interaction, the user is not only learning about the abstract thinking that the system may represent, but at the same time, the user is able to try the system in new, innovative configurations. Hence, the system becomes a true engine for innovation allowing the user to creatively invent, build and test new developments as the exploration is happening. As instantiations of this building block approach and its social impact, we briefly review the development and use of modular robotic devices for education, health improvements, and business in Africa. We briefly outline the modular building blocks for education, modular interactive tiles for rehabilitation in Tanzania and for soccer tournaments in Africa, Asia and Europe.","2162-7576","978-1-4673-0796-3","10.1109/ARSO.2011.6301970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301970","modular robotics;educational robotics;embodied AI;contextualised IT;rehabilitation robotics","Tiles;Robots;Context;Games;Abstracts;Light emitting diodes","educational computing;educational robots;innovation management;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;social aspects of automation;sport","social impact;embodied artificial intelligence;user-driven innovation;high tech solutions;physical manipulation;physical reconfiguration;abstract thinking;innovative configurations;modular robotic devices;health improvements;Africa;modular interactive tiles;Tanzania;soccer tournaments;Asia;Europe;modular building blocks","","2","","26","IEEE","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, designing a CNN model architecture necessitates a high-domain knowledge expert, which can be difficult for new researchers while solving real-world problems like medical image diagnosis. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an approach to reduce human intervention by automatically designing CNN architecture. This study proposes a two-phase evolutionary framework to design a suitable CNN model for medical image classification named TPEvo-CNN. The proposed framework mainly focuses on architectural depth search and hyper-parameter settings of the layered architecture for the CNN model. In the first phase, differential evolution (DE) is applied to determine the optimal number of layers for a CNN architecture, which enhances faster convergence to achieve CNN model architectures. In the second phase, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to fine-tune the hyper-parameter settings of the generated CNN layer architecture in the first phase. Crossover and mutation operations of GA are devised to explore the hyper-parameter search space. Also, an elitism selection strategy is introduced to select the potential hyper-parameters of the CNN architecture for the next generation. The suggested approach is experimented on six medical image datasets, including pneumonia, skin cancer, and four COVID-19 datasets, which are categorized based on image types and class numbers. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPEvo-CNN model compared to existing hand-crafted, pre-trained, and NAS-based CNN models in terms of classification metrics, confusion matrix, radar plots, and statistical analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3323705","Core Research Institute Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2021R1A6A1A03043144); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278411","Convolutional neural network;differential evolution;genetic algorithm;medical imaging;neural architecture search","Convolutional neural networks;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Pulmonary diseases;Genetic algorithms;Differential equations;Neural engineering;Biomedical image processing","","","","","","71","CCBYNCND","11 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers’ disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers’ disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.

It is found that the conventional floating number-based methods with uniform interval partitioning are not fully considering different watermark distributions, and the embedding distortion can be optimized. Thus, a reversible watermarking based on difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning is put forward for 2D engineering graphics. Each interval is adaptively partitioned into $2^{s}$2s sub-intervals, and the watermark is embedded via transforming the positions of the vertices to its corresponding sub-intervals. The watermark extraction is accomplished by acquiring the indices of the sub-intervals of the watermarked vertices, and the graphics recovery is achieved by moving the watermarked vertices to the reverse direction. Moreover, a new polar coordinate system is built to be invariant to overall geometric transformation and vertices rearrangement. Experimental results and analysis indicate that it maintains good authentication ability and semi-fragility. Furthermore, its imperceptibility is significantly improved compared with the existing watermarking schemes under the same experimental conditions.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3166134","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92067104,62072055,U1936115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754231","Adaptive partition;difference expansion;reversible watermarking;2D engineering graphics","Watermarking;Graphics;Distortion;Quantization (signal);Authentication;Wavelet transforms;Indexes","engineering graphics;watermarking","2D engineering graphics;adaptive interval partitioning;difference expansion;reversible watermarking;watermark distribution;watermark extraction","","","","35","IEEE","8 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the system model has been developed using vision-based computing, which involves managing data queues in terms of waiting periods to minimize congestion for data transmission with limited resources. The major significance of the proposed method is to utilize allocated spectrums for future generation networks by allocating necessary resources and therefore high usage of resources by all users can be avoided.

Meanwhile, these low-power devices typically cannot support complex security mechanisms and, thus, are highly susceptible to malware. This article proposes ADRIoT, an anomaly detection framework for IoT networks, which leverages edge computing to uncover potential threats. An edge is empowered with an anomaly detection module, which consists of a traffic capturer, a traffic preprocessor, and a collection of anomaly detectors dedicated to each type of device. Each detector is constructed by an LSTM autoencoder in an unsupervised manner that requires no labeled attack data and is able to handle emerging zero-day attacks. When a device connects to the edge, the edge will fetch the corresponding detector from the cloud and execute it locally. Another problem is the resource constraint of a single edge device like a home router hinders the deployment of such a detection module. To mitigate this problem, we design a multiedge collaborative mechanism that integrates the resource of multiple edges in a local network to increase the overall load capacity.

This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209447","NSFC(grant numbers:62072400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906974","Glyph-based visualization;metaphor;machine learning;automatic visualization","Data visualization;Visualization;Semantics;Layout;Authoring systems;Task analysis;Shape","computer graphics;data visualisation;Monte Carlo methods;tree searching","automatic generation;comprehensive visual metaphors;design preferences;glyph design;glyph nonoverlap;impressive graphic design;input data semantics;MetaGlyph;metaphor embodiment;metaphoric glyph-based visualization;metaphoric image selection;MGVs;professional design skills;visual elements","","4","","68","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we build a secure platform to enhance the trustworthiness of digital governance interoperability and data exchange using blockchain and deep learning-based frameworks. Initially, an optimal blockchain leveraging approach is designed using the bonobo optimization algorithm to authenticate data generated from smart city environments. Furthermore, we introduce the integration of a lightweight Feistel structure with optimal operations to enhance privacy preservation. This integration provides two levels of security and ensures interoperability and double-secured data exchange in digital governance systems. In addition, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to detect and prevent intrusions such as fraud/corruption in the smart city data. This approach enhances transparency and accountability in accessing the data and shows its predominance over other cutting-edge techniques on two benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework in real-time scenarios has been demonstrated through two case studies.

This requires a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across different application domains. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to enable such semantic interoperability. A standards-based approach is used to develop a Product Semantic Representation Language (PSRL). Formal description logic (DAML+OIL) is used to encode the PSRL. Mathematical logic and corresponding reasoning is used to determine semantic equivalences between an application ontology and the PSRL. The semantic equivalence matrix enables resolution of ambiguities created due to differences in syntaxes and meanings associated with terminologies in different application domains. Successful semantic interoperability will form the basis of seamless communication and thereby enable better integration of product development systems. Note to Practitioners-Semantic interoperability of product information refers to automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data, among information resources throughout the product development. This research is motivated by the problems in enabling such semantic interoperability. First, product information is formalized into an explicit, extensible, and comprehensive product semantics representation language (PSRL). The PSRL is open and based on standard W3C constructs. Next, in order to enable semantic translation, the paper describes a procedure to semi-automatically determine mappings between exactly equivalent concepts across representations of the interacting applications. The paper demonstrates that this approach to translation is feasible, but it has not yet been implemented commercially. Current limitations and the directions for further research are discussed. Future research addresses the determination of semantic similarities (not exact equivalences) between the interacting information resources.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2005.849087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458714","CAD/CAM integration;ontologies;product data exchange;semantic interoperability","Ontologies;Product development;Logic;Information resources;Collaborative tools;Collaborative software;Software tools;Product design;Application software;Microstrip","programming language semantics;product development;product design;CAD;software tools;formal logic;open systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","product development;software tools;product design;product data semantics;application domains;ontology-based exchange;semantic interoperability;Product Semantic Representation Language;formal description logic;mathematical logic;semantic equivalence matrix;collaborative environment;product information","","119","","28","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is still a challenging task to deploy the CNN model on the mobile sensors, which are typically resource-constrained in terms of the storage space, the computing capacity, and the battery life. Although cloud computing has become a popular solution, data security and response latency are always the key issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework for privacy-preserving CNN feature extraction for mobile sensing based on edge computing. To get the most out of the benefits of CNN with limited physical resources on the mobile sensors, we design a series of secure interaction protocols and utilize two edge servers to collaboratively perform the CNN feature extraction. The proposed scheme allows us to significantly reduce the latency and the overhead of the end devices while preserving privacy.

Therefore, it is imperative to correctly identify COVID-19 positive patients and isolate them as soon as possible to contain the spread of the disease and reduce the ongoing burden on the healthcare system. The primary COVID-19 screening test, RT-PCR although accurate and reliable, has a long turn-around time. In the recent past, several researchers have demonstrated the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods on chest radiography (such as X-ray and CT) for COVID-19 detection. However, existing CNN based DL methods fail to capture the global context due to their inherent image-specific inductive bias. Methods: Motivated by this, in this work, we propose the use of vision transformers (instead of convolutional networks) for COVID-19 screening using the X-ray and CT images. We employ a multi-stage transfer learning technique to address the issue of data scarcity. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by our transformer networks are explainable. Results: We demonstrate that our method not only quantitatively outperforms the recent benchmarks but also focuses on meaningful regions in the images for detection (as confirmed by Radiologists), aiding not only in accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 but also in localization of the infected area. The code for our implementation can be found here - https://github.com/arnabkmondal/xViTCOS.

This paper presents a self-organized P2P framework that supports scalable and efficient manufacturing service (MS) discovery for cross-enterprise collaboration by forming and maintaining autonomous enterprise peer groups (PG). Each enterprise exhibits as a peer that provides some sharable MSs that are represented comprehensively and formally with a generalized ontology. Each enterprise PG dynamically clusters a set of enterprise peers offering semantically similar MSs, and elects the most reputed peer through multicriteria trust evaluation as its core (i.e., super peer, SP). Then, a MS request can be first routed to the suitable SP and further to its leaf peer in a systematic way, thus supporting efficient service discovery.

The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3081926","Erasmus+ Strategic Partnerships Project Blockchain for Entrepreneurs - a Non-Traditional Industry 4.0 Curriculum for Higher Education(grant numbers:2018-1-RO01-KA203-049510); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435331","Blockchain;smart contract;decentralized autonomous organization;ontology;smart contract language;business process;B2B","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Collaboration;Contracts;Ontologies;Organizations;Automobiles","business data processing;commerce;contracts;electronic commerce;formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);XML","specified rules;contractual- business semantics;legally-binding smart contract;DAO collaborations;smart-contract languages;legally-binding contract;designing developing smart contracts;smart-legal-contract markup language;business constructs;legally-binding DAO;formal SCL ontology;legal- business semantics;SLCML language;life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract;blockchain platform implementations;formal specification smart-contract language;legally binding decentralized autonomous organizations;smart-contract technology;business processes;rising interest;blockchain technology;business rules;smart-contract programs","","22","","57","CCBY","19 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SysReqs and emerging architecture are constructed through gradual and iterative transition from the problem domain and operational stakeholder requirements to the conceptual solution domain. They later constitute the basis for functional requirements elaborating, concept formation, technology selection, function-to-form allocation, and asset utilization. Only rarely can stakeholder requirements (SHRs) readily translate to SysReqs. Systems engineers must therefore elicit, analyze, and evolve the SysReqs, as these will radically affect the system's performance, robustness, endurance, and appeal. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a framework for effective and consistent systems engineering and architecting. MBSE relies on modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM). OPM is a holistic MBSE paradigm and language for complex systems and processes, standardized as ISO 19450, which relies on the principle of minimal universal ontology. In this paper, we propose a model-based requirement engineering (MBRE) approach to facilitate the transition from SHRs to SysReqs, and from SysReqs to system architecture specification.

We believe providing a design team with an interactive tabletop can fulfill the first role and an interactive whiteboard can satisfy the second. Users will be able to switch seamlessly between the two, shifting content from one to the other when necessary.

We have analyzed this problem within a multiagent task execution scenario, in which every task requires collaboration among multiple agents to get completed. Tasks are also ad hoc in the sense that they appear dynamically and require different sets of expertise or capabilities from agents for completion. We model collaboration within this framework as a decision-making problem in which agents have to determine what capabilities to learn and from which agents to learn them so that they can form teams that have the capabilities required to perform the current tasks satisfactorily. Our proposed technique refers to principles from human learning theory to enable an agent to strategically select appropriate capabilities to learn from other agents. We also use two openness parameters to model the dynamic nature of tasks and agents in the environment. Experimental results within the Repast agent simulator show that by using the appropriate learning strategy, the overall utility of the agents improves considerably. The performance of the agents and their utilities are also dependent on the repetitiveness of tasks and reencounter with agents within the environment. Our results also show that the agents that are able to learn more capabilities from another expert agent outperform the agents who learn only one capability at a time from many agents, and agents who use an intelligent utility maximizing strategy to choose which capabilities to learn outperform the agents who randomly make the learning decision.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2285527","COMRADES Project funded by the Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000140911174); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651856","Ad hoc networks;collaborative work;learning;multiagent systems;Ad hoc networks;collaborative work;learning;multiagent systems","Collaboration;Education;Protocols;Software agents;Multi-agent systems;Robots","decision making;digital simulation;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","strategic capability-learning;multiagent collaboration;ad hoc environments;distributed collaboration;multiagent task execution scenario;decision-making problem;human learning theory;openness parameters;Repast agent simulator;task repetitiveness;intelligent utility maximizing strategy","","12","","18","IEEE","1 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, the lack of integrating system development process with cosimulations leads to gaps between them, decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of system development. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chains have been proposed to facilitate the integration of complex system development and automated verification using a model-based approach. However, due to the lack of formal and structured specifications, development information sharing is difficult for supporting MBSE facilitating automated cosimulations. In order to formalize cosimulation in an MBSE tool-chain, a scenario-based ontology is developed in this paper, using formal web ontology language (OWL). Ontology refers to a specification expressing the cosimulation implementations as well as the development information represented in the models supporting the MBSE. It is illustrated by a case study of a cosimulation based on Simulink. Protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) and semantic query-enhanced web rule language queries are proposed for evaluating the ontology's completeness and logic for supporting cosimulations. The result demonstrates that the scenario-based ontology formalizes the information related to automated cosimulation development and configurations while using the proposed MBSE tool-chain.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2911418","China National Ministries(grant numbers:JCKY2014602B007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8734748","Cosimulation;model-based systems engineering (MBSE);ontology design;simulation automation;tool-chain","Ontologies;Tools;Automation;OWL;Data models;Mathematical model","formal specification;formal verification;knowledge representation languages;Linked Data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query languages;semantic Web;systems engineering","design ontology;model-based systems engineering tool-chain;multiphysics models;formal specifications;structured specifications;development information sharing;MBSE tool-chain;scenario-based ontology;automated cosimulation development;system-level verification approach;formal Web ontology;semantic query-enhanced Web rule language queries;OWL;resource description framework query language;RDF;SPARQL;multidomain models","","11","","39","OAPA","11 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ontology mapping employs a top-down approach to explore all bridge relations between two terms from different ontologies based on bridge axioms and deduction rules. Ontology alignment adopts a bottom-up approach to discover implicit bridge relations between two terms from different domain ontologies based on equivalent inference. Ontology merging generates a new collaboration ontology from discovered equivalent bridge relations. It adopts an axiom-based ontology fusion strategy and takes heavy-weighted ontologies into consideration. It can find all the explicit and derived interontology relations. In a typical CEE, the proposed approach has a great potential to improve the efficiency of preparation for HLA-based collaborative engineering processes, reduce the work load for adaptive adjustment of existing platforms, and enhance the reusability and flexibility of CEEs.

This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making.

Pervasive healthcare systems apply information and communication technology to enable the usage of ubiquitous clinical data by authorized medical persons. However, quality of clinical data in these applications is, to a large extent, determined by the technological context of the patient. A technological context is characterized by potential technological disruptions that affect optimal functioning of technological resources. The clinical data based on input from these technological resources can therefore have quality degradations. If these degradations are not noticed, the use of this clinical data can lead to wrong treatment decisions, which potentially puts the patient's safety at risk. This paper presents an ontology that specifies the relation among technological context, quality of clinical data, and patient treatment. The presented ontology provides a formal way to represent the knowledge to specify the effect of technological context variations in the clinical data quality and the impact of the clinical data quality on a patient's treatment. Accordingly, this ontology is the foundation for a quality of data framework that enables the development of telemedicine systems that are capable of adapting the treatment when the quality of the clinical data degrades, and thus guaranteeing patients' safety even when technological context varies.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2458870","European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for the research, technological development, and demonstration(grant numbers:287811); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163538","Context;Ontology;Telemedicine;Quality of Data;Context;ontology;telemedicine;quality of data","Context;Ontologies;Telemedicine;Monitoring;Quality of service;Medical treatment","data structures;health care;information technology;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);patient treatment;quality management;safety;technology management;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing","telemedicine system development;data quality framework;patient treatment adaptation;clinical data quality effect;technological context variation effect;knowledge representation;patient safety;treatment decision;clinical data quality degradation;technological resource input;optimal technological resource function;technological disruption effect;technological context characterization;ubiquitous clinical data quality;communication technology;information technology;patient condition;medical case;pervasive healthcare system;technological context variation resiliency;telemedicine system resiliency;ontology","","9","","28","OAPA","21 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep design aims to identify sources of emotionally rich and strong experiences and feelings in order to augment them subsequently by means of smart technology. The most intrinsical needs of users, their deep needs, should be revealed and reflected in the process. Evaluation of a new technology is described as a successive process, starting with immediate decision, followed by short-term acceptance and finally long-term appropriation driven by the deep needs in a role of high order reinforcers. Deep design builds on various existing human-centric and emotion-driven approaches, but brings them further, or maybe rather deeper, bringing deep psycho-technical and socio-technical factors on the highest levels of importance. The idea of deep design is being introduced in a context of ambient technologies for elderlies, because actually there are certain dissonances in what do elderlies need and what many current intelligent technologies offer. As we show in the paper, our research in sources ranging from gerontology to ambient intelligence revealed four clusters of deep needs of elderlies-social touch, autonomy with anticipated support, feeling of being competent and feeling of helpfulness and self-worth.","","978-1-4244-7836-1","10.1109/IE.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673823","deep design;ambient intelligence;elderlies;old age;quality of life;acceptance;appropriation;human-centric design","Senior citizens;Aging;Usability;Guidelines;Home appliances;Ambient intelligence;Humans","artificial intelligence;design;geriatrics;humanities;social aspects of automation","ambient intelligence;acceptable appliance;deep design;smart technology;deep psycho-technical factor;socio-technical factor;ambient technology;intelligent technology;gerontology;elderlies-social touch","","6","","36","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the “obstacles” on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency. We empirically evaluate a number of state-of-the-art architectures to choose the best model based on fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Finally, we built fully integrated IPSAD prototype on Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3). Audio feedback scheme were implemented to accommodate user preferences and personalization. We perform quantitative evaluation of the prototype system based on the accuracy of the model on Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk (AS) dataset, on-field system performance, data communication, response time (capturing images, recognition of obstacle and feedback), and failure points. Empirical evaluation showed that the accuracy of the model is 87% on the AS dataset and 78.75% on-field system. The system can operate either standalone mode when there is no Internet or cloud mode. In addition, the system can use human intelligence through crowd source and caregiver(s) to assist the users when automated system fails.","","978-1-5386-5959-5","10.1109/ISC2.2018.8656966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8656966","","Navigation;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Legged locomotion;Blindness;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;handicapped aids;human factors;image recognition;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","deep learning;personalized feedback;transfer learning;real-time obstacle recognition;form factor devices;lower energy consumption;IPSAD prototype;Raspberry Pi3;audio feedback scheme;user preferences;response time;empirical evaluation;interactive device;pretrained convolutional neural network models;visually impaired person;interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device;quantitative evaluation;Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk dataset","","6","","33","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The value of applying activity theory is illustrated by reflecting back on the practical and theoretical challenges identified.

This becomes even more necessary in the case of multimorbidity (i.e. presence of multiple chronic diseases) or in conditions where several underlying risk factors need to be managed and monitored in order to avoid relapse or the reoccurrence of an event, like in the case of stroke. However, despite the fact that these decision support systems are becoming prevalent, little is known about the best practices in designing for end-users - patients and their carers. The aim of the present paper is to report on the process of involving users to inform the design of a novel data-driven self-management mobile decision support tool for stroke survivors, called CONSULT. User involvement was facilitated through the use of a two-phase participatory design approach. During both phases a total of 44 stakeholders participated, including stroke survivors, carers, healthcare professionals and researchers.

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through telephone interviews with representatives from 126 organizations throughout Europe in a sample stratified according to size, sector, and knowledge-intensity. The activities that appear to be most promising are “reflecting on and refining work practices and processes,” “finding people with particular knowledge or expertise,” as well as “assessing, verifying, and rating information.” Rich empirical material about how these activities are performed and also the issues that emerged and need to be managed were collected.

Logging interactions and temporal 3D content properties in a uniform, explorable way can be useful in various domains that involve multiple collaborating users and interacting objects, and can benefit from analysis of the users' and objects' behavior, e.g., in design, training, education, e-commerce, marketing and merchandising. However, the available approaches do not enable creation of explorable immersive VR/AR applications with regards to interactions and temporal 3D content properties. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to generating explorable interaction logs in immersive applications. The logs are ontologies compliant with the semantic web. Hence, the approach may be used with general or domain knowledge in a way intelligible to average users or domain specialists without expertise in IT. The approach is discussed in the context of a heterogeneous immersive environment, which combines diverse VR presentation and interaction devices to enable collaboration of multiple users within urban design.","2379-1780","978-1-5386-7590-8","10.1109/IC3D.2018.8657830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657830","3D content exploration;interaction;semantic web;urban design;Unity","Three-dimensional displays;Ontologies;Semantics;Solid modeling;Urban areas;Tools;Semantic Web","augmented reality;groupware;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","logging interactions;immersive virtual reality applications;augmented reality applications;domain-specific semantics;temporal 3D content properties;multiple collaborating users;interacting objects;e-commerce;explorable interaction logs;immersive applications;general domain knowledge;domain specialists;heterogeneous immersive environment;interaction devices;explorable immersive VR-AR applications","","4","","20","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications utilizing approximate computing (AxC) can tolerate some loss of quality in the computed results for attaining high performance. Approximate arithmetic circuits have been extensively studied; however, their application at system level has not been extensively pursued. Furthermore, when approximate arithmetic circuits are applied at system level, error-accumulation effects and a convergence problem may occur in computation. Multiple approximate components can interact in a typical datapath, hence benefiting from each other. Many applications require more complex datapaths than a single multiplication. In this paper, a hardware/software co-design methodology for adaptive approximate computing is proposed. It makes use of feature constraints to guide the approximate computation at various accuracy levels in each iteration of the learning process in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The proposed adaptive methodology also considers the input operand distribution and the hybrid approximation. Compared with a baseline design, the proposed method significantly reduces the power-delay product while incurring in only a small loss of accuracy. Simulation and a case study of image segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2021.3051643","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62022041,61871217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324944","Approximate computing;approximate multiplier;k-means clustering;semi-supervised learning","Approximate computing;Hardware;Approximation algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Semisupervised learning;Software;Clustering algorithms","approximation theory;electronic engineering computing;hardware-software codesign;image segmentation;integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;matrix multiplication;neural nets;pattern clustering;power aware computing","image segmentation;artificial neural network learning;single multiplication;ANN learning;hardware codesign;software codesign;multiple approximate components;approximate arithmetic circuits;digital system design;energy-efficiency;clustering;hybrid approximation;adaptive approximate computing","","4","","36","CCBY","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods always assume that the ontology already exists. However, ontology construction itself is a big challenge and the construction of ontology for component retrieval has its own characteristics differing from general domain ontology, including the emphasis on functional semantics, the explicit instance set (i.e. semantic descriptions of all the components stored in the repository) and the explicit objective of characterizing components for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an incremental and FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) based ontology construction method. The feature of incremental ontology construction means a collaborative and interactive process with component providers to collect basic input/output descriptions of components. FCA with the extension of hierarchical-valued concept context is adopted to elicit concepts from original component descriptions to construct ontological hierarchy for functional concepts. After concept analysis, semantic representation of each component can also be filled automatically. So our method can alleviate the efforts of ontology construction remarkably and the quality can also be ensured in terms of the requirements of component retrieval.","2332-662X","978-0-7695-3035-2","10.1109/QSIC.2007.4385513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385513","","Ontologies;Collaboration;Computer science;Programming;Software reusability;Large-scale systems;Software quality;Electronic commerce","information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);programming language semantics","ontology construction method;semantics-based component retrieval;formal concept analysis;hierarchical-valued concept context","","4","","12","IEEE","21 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tasks are traditionally scheduled on the on-board unit (OBU), which leads to long completion time of tasks. Heuristic algorithms are widely used in task scheduling problems, which usually causes to premature convergence. Scheduling tasks in edge environment can effectively reduce completion time of tasks. In this paper, a workflow scheduling strategy was designed in edge environment according to the difference of reasoning tasks and the changes of edge nodes in various time-slots. Firstly, the model of Markov decision process (MDP) was built to describe the problem scenario, and the completion time of reasoning tasks was calculated by the workflow scheduling algorithm. Secondly, the Q-learning algorithm based on simulated anealing (SA-QL) was proposed to optimize the completion time of reasoning tasks. Finally, the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms based on simulated annealing (SA-RL) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were comprehensively displayed from four perspectives: effectiveness, feasibility, exploration and convergence. The experimental results show that both SA-RL algorithms and PSO algorithm have good performance in feasibility and effectiveness. TD(0) algorithms have better performance of exploration and TD() algorithms have that of convergence.","","978-1-7281-4328-6","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SustainCom-SocialCom48970.2019.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9047475","Edge Computing, Autonomous Driving, Workflow Scheduling, Reinforcement Learning","Task analysis;Cognition;Optimal scheduling;Autonomous vehicles;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Processor scheduling","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile robots;particle swarm optimisation;scheduling;simulated annealing","time-driven workflow scheduling strategy;autonomous driving;edge environment;real-time reasoning tasks;task scheduling problems;workflow scheduling algorithm;on-board unit;heuristic algorithms;Markov decision process;Q-learning algorithm;simulated anealing;reinforcement learning algorithms;particle swarm optimization algorithm;SA-RL algorithms;PSO algorithm","","3","","20","IEEE","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to learn to design them, the student must be presented with complex, open-ended problems for which there may be more than one correct solution. The decision-making strategies students acquired in previous courses are not effective when applied to large, complex problems of distributed systems. Students (novice designers) tend to think linearly and focus only on the problem at hand. They also tend to use trial-and-error strategies and they lack confidence in their design decisions. The purpose of the distributed systems' course is to create a learning approach that helps students to adopt and to apply expert design decision-making strategies. We use a case-based learning approach with classroom assessment techniques and rubrics to identify the critical weaknesses in the approaches that novices typically use when attempting to solve difficult design-oriented problems. The novice-oriented knowledge-based learning and application environment is supported by scaffoldings to incorporate expert strategies. In this paper, we describe the experience and the learning environment that provides the opportunities for professional development.

Given a set of base learners and a collection of samples with a few shots, we consider two problems: 1) finding a subset of base learners that well predict the sample collections; and 2) replacing the low-quality shots with more representative ones to adequately represent the sample collections. We formulate both problems as sparse subset selection and develop two selection algorithms to recommend appropriate learners and shots, respectively. A matrix visualization and a scatterplot are combined to explain the recommended learners and shots in context and facilitate users in adjusting them. Based on the adjustment, the algorithm updates the recommendation results for another round of improvement. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate that FSLDiagnotor helps build a few-shot classifier efficiently and increases the accuracy by 12% and 21%, respectively.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3182488","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20469,61936002); Institute Guo Qiang; THUIBCS; BLBCI; Tsinghua-Kuaishou Institute of Future Media Data; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795241","Few-shot learning;ensemble model;subset selection;matrix visualization;scatterplot","Visualization;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Training;Analytical models;Data models;Behavioral sciences","data analysis;data visualisation;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","few-shot classifier;base learners;visual analysis method;sample collections;low-quality shots;sparse subset selection;appropriate learners;recommended learners","","3","","64","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the fuzzy rules given by expert experience, through the ability of self-learning, trained the fuzzy neural network and memorized the fuzzy control rules, and obtained the network demand of each control loop. Then, using the idea of real-time task scheduling, according to the idle time and the criticality of each control task, the urgency parameters of the loop control task are obtained from the defined fuzzy control rules. Finally, combining the urgency parameter and the network demand parameter of the control task, the dynamic weight algorithm is used to obtain the priority of each loop and adjust it online before the next sampling moment. This article uses Matlab's truetime toolbox for the establishment and simulation of NCS models, and anfis toolbox for fuzzy neural network training.

As melanomas tend to go unnoticed without constant supervision, it is important that steps are taken to identify and prevent their spread before they reach more severe stages. Many recent clinical trials and research have identified various indicators of melanoma that may be used for early detection. In this work, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to localize and detect one such indicator - a strong correlation between the number of pigmented freckles in a person's iris and their risk of developing melanoma on the skin. We model this task of detecting pigmented iris freckles as a single-class, one-sized object detection problem. For this, we propose Slim-YOLO, a lighter and simpler object detection model based on YOLOv3. The simplifications of Slim-YOLO are introduced through reducing the model computations by removing the need for multiple detection scales and classification. We also remove the constraints applied by anchor boxes. The experimental results show that Slim-YOLO is capable of achieving comparable performance (90.7% in mAP) with YOLOv3 (93.7%) while yielding a smaller model size of two-third the size of YOLOv3. These may prove highly beneficial to better facilitate deployment of the model on mobile devices in the future. Thus, we automate the iris freckle detection process successfully to help provide insights to practitioners, and contribute to the use of deep learning methods in detection of anomalies in medical imaging.","","978-1-6654-1709-9","10.1109/DICTA52665.2021.9647150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9647150","melanoma;deep learning;object detection;pigmented iris freckles","Performance evaluation;Iris;Malignant tumors;Computational modeling;Object detection;Predictive models;Mobile handsets","biomedical optical imaging;cancer;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical image processing;neural nets;object detection;skin","model computations;multiple detection scales;classification;Slim-YOLO;YOLOv3;smaller model size;iris freckle detection process;simplified object detection model;pigmented iris freckles;potential biomarker;cutaneous melanoma;dangerous form;skin cancer;recent clinical trials;Convolutional Neural Networks;pigmented freckles;person;one-sized object detection problem;lighter object detection model;simpler object detection model","","2","","28","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since its inception, it has continued to evolve, leading to the development of intelligent and automated radiography systems that are able to perceive parts of their environment and respond accordingly. However, such systems do not provide a complete view of the examination space and are therefore unable to detect multiple objects and fully ensure the safety of patients, staff and equipment during the execution of the movement. In this paper, we present a system architecture based on ROS (Robot Operating System) to solve these challenges and integrate an autonomous X-ray device. The architecture retrieves point clouds from range sensors placed at specific locations in the examination room. By integrating different subsystems, the architecture merges the data from the different sensors to map the space. It also implements downsampling and clustering methods to identify objects and later distinguish obstacles. A subsystem generates bounding boxes based on the detected obstacles and feeds them to a motion planning framework (MoveIt!) to enable collision avoidance during motion execution. At the same time, a subsystem implements a deep neural network model (PointNet) to classify the detected obstacles. Finally, the developed system architecture provided promising results after being deployed in a Gazebo simulated examination space and on a use case test platform.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3159239","Innovation Think Tank, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733894","3D depth camera;motion planning;obstacle detection;object recognition radiography systems;robot operating system","Sensors;Point cloud compression;Sensor systems;X-ray imaging;Medical services;Collision avoidance;Computer architecture","cameras;collision avoidance;control engineering computing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image sensors;medical control systems;mobile robots;object detection;operating systems (computers);radiography;robot programming","collision avoidance route planning;autonomous medical devices;multiple depth cameras;intelligent radiography systems;automated radiography systems;autonomous X-ray device;point clouds;range sensors;downsampling methods;clustering methods;motion planning framework;motion execution;Gazebo simulated examination space;robot operating system;deep neural network model","","2","","34","CCBY","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ontology modularization is the process of extracting a fragment, or ”module”, from an ontology, based on predefined requirements. Due to both the diversity in ontological representations and motivations for modularizing, the body of research on ontology modularization techniques has become extremely large and may be intimidating to the novice ontology researcher. The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive, albeit high-level, review of ontology modularization techniques. A systematic literature review covering January 1st 2000 to July 31st 2020 was performed to find and classify papers on ontology modularization techniques. The techniques exhibiting certain properties with respect to several features were assessed, and the modularization techniques were classified with a multi-dimensional perspective. The classifications are intended to guide one to a suitable modularization process in accordance with the requirements.

However, they produce limited results, as semantic meanings are typically not taken into account. Our interdisciplinary collaboration between visualization and digital humanities combined a semi-supervised text alignment approach based on word embeddings that take not only syntactic but also semantic text features into account, thereby improving the overall quality of the alignment. In our collaboration, we developed different visual interfaces that communicate the word distribution in high-dimensional vector space generated by the underlying neural network for increased transparency, assessment of the tool’s reliability and overall improved hypothesis generation. We further offer visual means to enable the expert reader to feed domain knowledge into the system at multiple levels with the aim of improving both the product and the process of text alignment.

Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. Effective watershed management requires information-rich communication among central and local authorities, private industry, citizens, and academia. Effective watershed planning, regulation and management also require timely conveyance of information to agency staff, decision makers, and the public. Customized Decision Support Systems (DSS) are required for this purpose, to provide wide access to workflows to query, visualization, and compare vital information. DSS can use basically the same information for strategic or emergency planning if the access to the data, simulations, and workflow operation can be done in real-time. It is the duty of public and private sectors to determine how to effectively support the decision-making process without neglecting the appropriate amount of evaluation and the inclusion of stakeholders in the process. The paper presents a concept for interjurisdictional collaboration in water resources management, using a DSS platform that integrates the data and information needed to support short- and long-term watershed actions. The focus of the paper is on describing an ontological framework which combines representative actors/stakeholders, hydrologic concepts and relationships with elements of offering an integrated approach to complex water related processes.","","978-1-4673-8692-0","10.1109/AQTR.2016.7501393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501393","interjurisdictional collaboration;water resource management;decision support systems","Water resources;Stakeholders;Decision making;Economics;Water pollution;Decision support systems;Collaboration;Climate change","decision support systems;environmental science computing;hydrology;ontologies (artificial intelligence);water resources","interjurisdictional collaboration;water resource management;interjurisdictional alliances;watershed management;watershed planning;watershed regulation;data acquisition;decision support systems;DSS;ontological framework;hydrologic concepts","","1","","34","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thorough knowledge about the physical exercises is crucial in designing efficient exergames. Expert involvement in the design process, in this case with physiotherapists, is an efficient way to gather and retain domain specific knowledge for the design team. However, experts rarely have experience exploring design alternatives in a playful way, which is important when participating on the co-design of serious games like exergames. We explored the question: How can we involve experts to share and professionally explore their domain specific knowledge in a play-centric game design process? We present two co-design exergame workshops with physiotherapists. Based on lessons learned from the first workshop, we explored in the second workshop framing the entire workshop process as a game. We found that gamifying the workshop process into a design game provided a way to change the experts' effective-oriented mindset into a playful mindset. This article demonstrates some lessons learned from this process of creating and using such a method and proposes some directions for future research and applications.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401343","exercising and active living;game design and development;rehabilitation;design games;exergame design;game design tools;game design process","Games;Conferences;Training;Avatars;Computer science;Cognition","computer games;customer services;learning (artificial intelligence);product design","design game;playful mindset;balance training exergames;physical exercises;expert involvement;physiotherapists;domain specific knowledge;design team;design alternatives;serious games;play-centric game design process;co-design exergame workshops;entire workshop process;Exergame Co-DesignWorkshop","","1","","34","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming at the diversity of design knowledge, this paper proposes an ontology-based model to reach at an unambiguous and normative representation of the knowledge. Firstly, an ontology-based human-machine integrated design framework is described, then corresponding ontologies and sub-ontologies are established according to different purposes and scopes. Secondly, a similarity calculation-based ontology integration method composed of ontology mapping and ontology merging is introduced. The ontology searching-based knowledge sharing method is then developed.

During its early stages, Riva relies heavily on brainstorming the EBEs from stakeholders. However, it does not provide a systematic process for deriving generalized BPA models from multiple heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, when deriving processes from the identified Riva-EBEs, Riva identifies Case Processes (CPs), Case Management Processes (CMPs), and Case Strategy Processes (CSPs). However, the Riva literature mainly supports modelling the CPs, CMPs, and the relationships between them. It does not focus on modelling the CSPs nor their related relationships. Accordingly, Riva has been semantically-enriched by the srBPA ontology component. But this semantic enrichment was limited to the original aspects of Riva and does not address the raised issues. This paper presents an adaptation to the semantic enrichment of Riva (an adapted srBPA ontology) to include the semantic representation of the CSPs and their related relationships, in addition to supporting the representation of BPA concepts and resolving semantic heterogeneity resulting from electing the EBEs from multiple heterogeneous sources. The proposed adapted ontology has been evaluated by checking its consistency, completeness, and redundancy.","","978-1-6654-1995-6","10.1109/ACIT53391.2021.9677387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677387","Riva;Business Process Architecture;srBPA;Adapted srBPA;Generalized BPA;Semantic enrichment of Riva","Adaptation models;Systematics;Semantics;Redundancy;Ontologies;Brain modeling;Stakeholders","business data processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects","generalized BPA;heterogeneous sources;case management processes;case strategy processes;CSPs;Riva literature;semantic enrichment;srBPA ontology;semantic heterogeneity;Riva-EBEs;essential business entities;generalized Riva-driven business process architecture;business process architecture modelling;organizational boundaries;brainstorming;CMPs;semantic representation","","1","","18","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They assume that the vector representations of entities and relations are consistent in any semantic environment. Semantic discriminate knowledge representation models focus more on precision. They assume that the vector representations should depend on the specific semantic environment. However, both the two kinds only consider knowledge embedding in semantic space, ignoring the rich features of network structure contained between triplet entities. The MulSS model proposed in this paper is a joint embedding learning method across network structure space and semantic space. By synchronizing the Deepwalk network representation learning method into the semantic indiscriminate model TransE, MulSS achieves better performance than TransE and some semantic discriminate knowledge representation models on triplet classification task. This shows that it is of great significance to extend knowledge representation learning from the single semantic space to the network structure and semantic joint space.","2768-1904","979-8-3503-3168-4","10.1109/CSCWD57460.2023.10152719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152719","Knowledge Representation Learning;Network Structure Space;Semantic Space","Representation learning;Learning systems;Federated learning;Computational modeling;Scalability;Microscopy;Semantics","graph theory;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic networks;vectors","Deepwalk network representation;joint embedding learning method;knowledge representation learning;low-dimensional vector space;multiview knowledge graph embedding model considering structure;network structure space;semantic discriminate knowledge representation models;semantic indiscriminate knowledge representation models;semantic indiscriminate model TransE;semantic joint space;semantics;single semantic space;specific semantic environment;vector representations;world knowledge graphs","","","","24","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this paper is to explore regulatory instruments in the EU data protection law that can strike a balance between innovation and protection in the governance of human biodata. To this end, it focuses on meta-regulation as a regulatory technique and examines data protection impact assessment (DPIA) as a method for addressing the tension between innovation and protection. Based on doctrinal legal analysis, it argues that while DPIA is a useful instrument to seek a solution in this dilemma, further reflection and clarification are needed to improve the methods of conducting the impact assessment.","","979-8-3503-1017-7","10.1109/CIBCB56990.2023.10264903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10264903","biodata;biotechnology;data protection;DPIA;innovation;meta-regulation","Technological innovation;Law;Instruments;Data protection;Pressing;Games;Data processing","artificial intelligence;bioinformatics;biotechnology;data governance;data protection;innovation management;legislation","AI;biotechnological innovation;data processing;data protection impact assessment;doctrinal legal analysis;DPIA;EU data protection law;fundamental rights;human biodata governance;meta-regulation;regulatory instruments","","","","50","IEEE","2 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are critical risks involved in using AI systems in the health domain; risks that can have severe, irreversible, and life-changing impacts on people’s lives. With the development of innovative AI-based applications in the medical and healthcare sectors, new types of risks emerge. To benefit from novel AI applications in this domain, the risks need to be managed in order to protect the fundamental interests and rights of those affected. This will increase the level to which these systems become ethically acceptable, legally permissible, and socially sustainable. In this paper, we first discuss the necessity of AI risk management in the health domain from the ethical, legal, and societal perspectives.

Therefore, from the product design point of view, identifying required product knowledge is a very important thing. This product knowledge is closely related with product requirements and functions. However the type of knowledge and information of product, needed in virtual collaboration, is still not comprehensively explored and understood. The main purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify generic product knowledge and information to support knowledge sharing in a virtual collaboration environment. In this paper we propose a methodology for identification and modeling of product information, based on the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) principle. The FBS principle was then translated into classification of product information. The classification can give a comprehensive view of a product. The flexibility of classification developed in this research makes it easier to be implemented across various different type of product. It also provides a better understanding about the products and its subcomponents. The identification of product information was followed by translation of it into a model. A model of generic product information was successfully built. Further research is planned towards developing a combined graphical and ontological product information model based on FBS principles.","2159-5100","978-1-4244-8203-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5603299","","Collaboration;Product design;Knowledge engineering;Biological system modeling;Assembly;Materials","groupware;knowledge management;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;product design;production engineering computing","product knowledge identification;virtual collaboration environment;knowledge sharing;product design;generic product knowledge;function behavior structure principle;product information classification;ontological product information model","","","","25","","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface.

It may actively alter the signal propagation parameters in favor of signal reception and achieve the idea of a smart radio environment. In this survey, we first introduce essential concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its configurability. Then, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS’s phase control and the transceivers’ transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., capacity maximization and energy minimization problems; beamforming discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks, and using the deep learning method for discussion in IRS.

These conversations can occur over different channels such as email, chat, and voice calls. In such settings, conversation context and product purchase intent are spread across tens of message exchanges. To accurately predict the probability of a deal win, it is important to build classification models that capture such context continuity across a long chain of message exchanges. While past BERT-based work on modeling multi-turn conversations captures context history, they fall short when applied directly to sales negotiations which are not strictly multi-turn in nature, contain long messages, and are often interspersed with irrelevant “noise”. Additionally, extracting and communicating pivotal phrases in a customer message is a crucial undertaking as a part of model explainability. This requires additional attention to augmentation mechanisms keeping in mind the same context continuity. In this paper, we present a BERT-based novel architecture to achieve the above goals of conversation classification and prediction explainability. We train this architecture on a corpus of email exchanges available internally. Our architecture relies on a BERT-based multi-task training regimen trained for two tasks-one learns to predict deal closure from an email chain, and the other learns to extract multiple key-phrases from individual emails. The BERT setup also learns from short-term context to build email representations, which are further enhanced with extracted key-phrases using an attention-over-attention mechanism. Finally, Bi-LSTM layers capture long-term context across all phrase-enhanced emails in the conversation to predict deal closure. Experimental results demonstrate a~14-15% improvement in deal conversion accuracy and~10-12% improvement in Jaccard score for extracted phrases, outperforming our baseline model.","","978-1-6654-6067-5","10.1109/JCICE56791.2022.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887553","multi-turn email conversations;multi-task learning;phrase extraction;BERT bi-directional LSTM;phrase enhancement;CCS Concepts-information systems;information retrieval;retrieval tasks and goals;sentiment analysis","Training;Oral communication;Predictive models;Transformers;Multitasking;Electronic mail;History","consumer behaviour;customer relationship management;electronic mail;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recurrent neural nets","customer message;model explainability;additional attention;context continuity;conversation classification;prediction explainability;email exchanges;BERT-based multitask training regimen;email chain;short-term context;attention-over-attention mechanism;long-term context;phrase-enhanced emails;baseline model;CAPE-NET;context-aware phrase-enhanced network;mixed multiturn email conversations;SaaS CRM tools;sales agents;product purchase intent;message exchanges;sales negotiations;pivotal phrases;multiple key-phrases extraction;augmentation mechanisms","","","","22","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A possible reason is that developers are unlikely to understand domain and case-specific requirements of existing research questions. Methods: We formed a design team comprising a visualization expert, a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, bioinformatics domain experts, and the Principal Investigator (PI) as a `facilitator' filling the communication gap between them. We implemented co-design methodology. Results: We identified the need for an interactive visual analytic tool for exploratory analysis of biological data. We describe the process of developing MAHiCGO, a novel tool for the simultaneous visualization of MA Gene Expression data, Hi-C data and Gene Ontology (GO) information in an interactive manner for the exploratory analysis of biological data. Conclusion: The key finding of this research to include a facilitator role in the co-design is useful in the evolving fields of design research and of bioinformatics, merging computational sciences with biosciences. The findings support in understanding new functional roles in the field of design, in particular design of computer applications in highly complex domains such as bioinformatics, and for highly complex tasks such as exploratory tasks.

In this paper, we present an 11-week, multi-session, participatory design case study, identify challenges in analyzing physiological and behavior data, and present BEDA, an analytics tool we developed to mitigate the challenges. The two primary data analysis challenges include: (1) interfacing multiple software programs required for capturing and analyzing the different data sources, and (2) extending the limited data analysis functionality within and across these software programs to support a wide range of physiological data analyses. BEDA resolves the fragmented analysis pipeline by integrating closely-related analysis tasks into a common interface. It also addresses the extensibility problem by integrating scripts that apply any custom or publicly-available function written in MATLAB or R. These scripts extend basic analytic capability, provide the analytic bridge between physiological and behavior data, and incorporate machine learning algorithms to highlight behaviors associated with physiological data. BEDA's capabilities mitigated the challenges of signal analysis and fragmented data sources, and motivated behavioral scientists to combine physiological measures with behavioral analysis. Although we developed this tool for a domain-specific case study, the use of the tool can be generalized to analyze any time-based data source or sources.","","978-1-4673-9548-9","10.1109/ICHI.2015.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349688","Behavior analysis;physiological sensor data analysis;visual analytic tool","Data analysis;Physiology;Biomedical monitoring;Data visualization;Software;Pipelines;Algorithm design and analysis","behavioural sciences computing;biology computing;data analysis;data visualisation;health care;mathematics computing;physiology","visual analysis;behavioral sensor data;physiological sensor data;health data;electro dermal activity data;data analysis;Matlab","","1","","37","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of this interdisciplinary program adheres to participatory design principles. Here, we outline the motivation and demands of such program, the design of the program, the principles and practices planned and implemented, and we report on first implementation steps. Since the graduate programs of computing and engineering mostly provide broader education, the graduates from these programs lack relevant clinical perspectives, necessary to work in- and advance the domain of medical computing. Likewise, the graduates from clinical and medical programs are often missing up-to-date computing skills, essential to comprehend and manage the fast-developing industry of medical computing technology. By implementing the processes of funnelling industrial and clinical aspects, we ensure that the graduates are equipped with relevant knowledge, and become a part of germane networks.

The subject research follows a highly practical approach, providing specific practices for mitigation of the identified challenges. A survey study was conducted to gather data from engineering practitioners at a global professional services firm involved in virtual engineering projects between 2017 and 2018. Research conducted across best practices for virtual teams, coupled with the survey results, yielded a framework of five overarching themes to enable high-performing virtual engineering teams: technology integration, management of virtual resources, project governance controls, stakeholder engagement, and organizational drivers.

Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind near Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost Braille writing tutor. We present an iterative and participatory design process resulting in the creation and refinement of a prototype Braille writing tutor system. This system uses a novel input device to capture a student's activity on a slate using a stylus and uses a range of techniques to teach Braille writing skills to both beginner and advanced students.

To address that concern this work provides a detailed comparison between two elicitation studies that were similar in design apart from the way that participants were prompted for interaction proposals (i.e., the referents). Based on this comparison the impact of referent display on speech and gesture interaction proposals are each discussed. The interaction proposals between these elicitation studies were not identical. Gesture proposals were the least impacted by referent display, showing high proposal similarity between the two works. Speech proposals were highly biased by text referents with proposals directly mirroring text-based referents an average of 69.36% of the time.

Educational games for STEM subjects were designed and developed through an iteration process that considered the contextual significance of learners' diverse cultural backgrounds. Online and traditional games were used as sources of inspiration, and they were re-designed to fit with learner's interests and context. The findings from 42 learners who played the role as the game designers showed significant impact of the empathy stage in the design loop where cultural elements were shared and integrated into the design. The participatory design approach proves to be very useful in encouraging learners to provide their ideas. Some learners who had limited exposure to computer or video games were still able to combine suitable game mechanics and draw ideas from their surroundings to create their own games. The findings also reveal differing viewpoints of urban and rural learners with regards to use of games of learning. The outcomes from this study provided valuable insights in the formulation of a framework for game design that takes into account learners' diversity.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657214","gamification;learner diversity;empathy;game design thinking","Games;Social factors;Cultural differences;Engineering education;Faces;STEM","computer aided instruction;cultural aspects;human factors;serious games (computing);STEM","game mechanics;urban learners;rural learners;culturally diverse young learners;motivating learners;cultural factors;social factors;game design thinking;STEM subjects;iteration process;learner;game designers;design loop;STEM educational games;Minecraft","","","","21","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-user 3D virtual environments are a powerful form of collaborative telecommunication applications, enabling the users to share a common three dimensional space and interact with each other as well as with the environment surrounding them, in order to collaboratively solve problems or aid learning processes. This paper presents the work done for extending a multi-user virtual environments platform, to support collaborative spatial design applications. Furthermore, a usage scenario is presented concerning the collaborative design of a classroom for educational purposes.","1545-0678","0-7695-2838-4","10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279038","","Virtual environment;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Informatics;Design engineering;Space technology;Application software;Testing;Internet;Research and development","CAD;educational computing;groupware;human computer interaction;virtual reality","X3D multiuser virtual environment platform;collaborative spatial classroom design;learning environment;collaborative telecommunication application;human computer interaction","","8","","12","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the existing CCSs for solving gain of the controller, the controller mostly adopts the proportional (P) controller, but the most commonly used controller in industrial production is PI controller. Based on the actual demand in industry and in order to obtain a better control effect, the design problem of primary and secondary controllers in a class of discrete cascade control is considered, in which the primary controller adopts a PI controller and the secondary controller adopts a P controller. On this basis, the model of cascade control system (CCS) is established. Then, we can create a new Lyapunov functional, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the system is given. Then, the collaborative design method of primary PI controller and secondary P controller is given by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, a simulation example of a main steam temperature with CCS structure is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The PI controller is better than the existing P controller, this method has not only the rapidity of P control, but also the ability of integral control to eliminate steady-state errors. Note to Practitioners—The inspiration of this paper comes from the adjustment of plant controller parameters. The PI controller is the most widely used controller in the existing industrial production, but the adjustment of proportional and integral parameters of the controller is a very troublesome thing. In order to obtain a better controller parameters, a professional engineer may spend a whole day to adjust the parameters. This paper can design the solution of the primary and secondary controller parameters to stabilize the CCS at the same time by LMI technique, which can greatly reduce the work of adjusting the controller parameters. Through simulation, we can know that this method can make the system stable, which shows this method is feasible.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3204531","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20190955); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:SJCX22_1894); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882036","Discrete cascade control system;stabilization;proportional-integral (PI) control;primary controller;secondary controller","PI control;Control systems;Power system stability;Production;Thermal stability;Industries;Design methodology","cascade control;control system synthesis;linear matrix inequalities;Lyapunov methods;PI control;stability;temperature control","cascade control system;control effect;discrete cascade control systems;discrete-time cascade control systems;integral control;P control;plant controller parameters;primary controller;primary PI controller;proportional controller;secondary controller;secondary P controller","","7","","42","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems. Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied. This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them. Our results show that both agile and services make the end-toend analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions. Additionally, we open a new research avenue pointing to Amazon Macie as an example of Machine Learning applications that aim to provide a solution to the scalability and usability of Privacy Threat Modeling processes.","","978-1-5386-5445-3","10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406565","privacy by design;threat modeling;software development;agile;services;challenges;opportunities","Privacy;Security;Data privacy;Service-oriented architecture;Documentation","data protection;service-oriented architecture;software prototyping","Privacy Threat Modeling processes;threat modeling methods;security engineering;GDPR requirements;engineering systems;waterfall process;monolithic design;Agile methodologies;Service Oriented Architectures;agile service environments;privacy problems;software engineering practice;Agile principles;Service properties;General Data Protection Regulation","","7","","38","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoE brings excellent opportunities to improve changes in society with collaborative intelligent systems. However, these new technologies also bring significant challenges and do not address major existing issues, including interoperability, reliability, and intelligence management. Awareness of these issues is required before IoE applications can be widely deployed. This work introduces an observatory for cataloging IoE applications. Registering these applications will support researchers, developers, and users to exchange more information, design improved IoE applications, facilitating the composition of different enablers (human and non-humans).

Especially in business process, all the resource services are invoked in a certain sequence, which is called the Resource-Service Chain (RSC). The RSC, as a sequential composition of resource services, expresses the scheduling and the flow of servicing to a distributed business process. A perfect composition can improve utilization ratio and efficient matching availability of resource services greatly. However, most of the existing methods for resource service composition paid no attention to the temporal relationship between resource services. Moreover, the methods strongly depend on relevant element to be considered. Inspired by biological evolution, a Resource-Service Chain Composition Evolutionary (RSCCE) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, RSCCE tries to find multiple optimal solutions, namely all RSCs in a workflow with given constraints. To begin, initial sets of composite resource service are resolved by calculating the degree of dependency between resource services, so as to obtain initial RSCs by workflow. Then, RSCCE algorithm applies genetic algorithm to search for the extended of each initial RSC, a longer chain composing of it, to improve the reuse of RSC. Under this approach, gene and chromosome represent resource service and the entire RSC respectively. If the propagated chromosomes violate the sequence of resource service, as constraint in RSCCE algorithm, they will be repaired to obtain a valid solution. Finally, we take a multi-enterprise collaborative business process as an example to simulate our approach. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2969234","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1402500); Fujian Province Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:2019H0017); Quanzhou Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:2018C110R,2018Z008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968322","Distributed cloud manufacturing;resource-service chain;composition;evolutionary algorithm;business process","Task analysis;Manufacturing;Hidden Markov models;Evolutionary computation;Collaboration;Quality of service","cloud computing;genetic algorithms;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;resource allocation","resource service composition;Resource-Service Chain Composition Evolutionary algorithm;composite resource service;distributed cloud manufacturing systems;CMfg systems;RSCCE algorithm;genetic algorithm","","7","","37","CCBY","24 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose to address these shortcomings to support policymakers in identifying concrete action plans in Indonesia specifically. Our approach clarifies interrelationships for the context of use and supports structural (e.g., what aspects of a “smart city” are impacted by an intervention?) as well as what-if policy questions. We started with a systems' science approach to developing a cognitive map of the components and their interrelationships, as is increasingly done in participatory modeling and particularly in socio-ecological management. We transformed semi-structured interviews of 10 Indonesian experts into maps and assembled them to create the first comprehensive smart cities cognitive map for Indonesia, totaling 52 concepts and 98 relationships. While a cognitive map already provides support for decision-making (e.g., by identifying loops in the system), it is only conceptual and thus cannot form predictions. Consequently, we extended our cognitive map into a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), whose inference abilities allow to examine the dynamic response of an indicator (e.g., “smart city”) in response to different interventions. As fuzzy cognitive maps include the strengths of interrelationships but not the notion of time, future research may refine our model using system dynamics. This refinement would support policymakers in investigating when to conduct and/or evaluate an intervention.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908622","Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia through research funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8678634","Cognitive computing;participatory modeling;public policy;systems for smart cities","Smart cities;Information and communication technology;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Economics;Computational modeling;Sociology","cognitive systems;decision making;ecology;fuzzy set theory;government policies;organisational aspects;public administration;smart cities;socio-economic effects","interrelationships;Indonesia;fuzzy cognitive systems;implementation-oriented maturity model;comprehensive smart cities cognitive map;fuzzy cognitive map;Indonesian cities;policymakers;policymaking;socio-ecological management;FCM;dynamic response","","51","","95","CCBY","31 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background façade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and façade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building façades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)(grant numbers:JP19K12681); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9517298","Generative adversarial networks;semantic segmentation;automatic object removal;façade inpainting;street view images","Image segmentation;Buildings;Semantics;Urban areas;Task analysis;Object detection;Image restoration","","","","13","","44","CCBY","19 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the multiply-accumulate-based architecture, three design techniques are proposed to reduce the hardware cost of the convolutional computations. First, to reduce the computational cost of convolutions, an adaptive bit-width reduction combined with near-zero skipping is proposed based on differential input method (DIM). The DIM-based design technique can reduce 62.5% of operation bit-width and improve 17.0% of activation sparsity with almost ignorable CNN accuracy degradation. Second, it has been found that adopting a bi-directional filtering window in a CNN accelerator can considerably reduce the energy for data movement with a much smaller number of memory accesses. To expedite the bi-directional filtering operations, we also propose a bi-directional first-input-first-output (bi-FIFO). With SRAM bit-cell layout manner, the proposed bi-FIFO facilitates fast data re-distribution with area and energy efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, the AlexNet accelerator has been designed. The numerical results show that the proposed adaptive bit-width reduction scheme achieves 34.6% and 58.2% of area and energy savings, respectively. The bi-FIFO-based accelerator also achieves 32.8% improved processing time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2816019","National Research Foundation of Korea grant through the Korean Government(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1A2B4015329,NRF-2015M3D1A1070465); Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program (Development of SoC technology based on Spiking Neural Cell for smart mobile and IoT Devices) through the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, South Korea(grant numbers:10077445); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8316848","Deep neural network;convolutional neural network;accelerator;energy efficiency;quantization;activation sparsity;line buffer;FIFO","Hardware;Computational modeling;Bidirectional control;Filtering;Energy efficiency;Convolutional neural networks;Microsoft Windows","cost reduction;energy conservation;filtering theory;integrated circuit layout;neural chips;neural net architecture;SRAM chips","multiply-accumulate-based architecture;convolutional computations;differential input method;operation bit-width;bi-directional filtering window;CNN accelerator;bi-directional filtering operations;AlexNet accelerator;adaptive bit-width reduction scheme;hardware cost reduction;low cost convolutional neural network accelerator;energy-efficient hardware accelerator;CNNs;near-zero skipping;DIM-based design technique;activation sparsity;bi-directional first-input-first-output operation;bi-FIFO operation;SRAM bit-cell layout;fast data re-distribution;energy efficiency","","10","","40","OAPA","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, open-source software (OSS) development requires developers to collaborate with each other to conduct their work. Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the OSS projects (e.g., bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, and so on) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on OSS projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: social network analysis, DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting overtime. DSNs over time are considered a small-world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55% diversity with 75% of evenness between the developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment. Moreover, DSNs over time have a few developers as core members and large developers as peripheral members. Finally, about 10% of developers changed their positions frequently over time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2868427","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400604); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772155,61832014,61832004,61472106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454243","Software engineering;open source software;software quality;software maintenance;bug tracking systems;developer social network;evolution","Social network services;Software;Ecosystems;Collaboration;Computer bugs;Measurement;Task analysis","project management;public domain software;social networking (online);software engineering","DSN;software system;social network analysis;open-source software development;software developers;OSS developer teams;social collaboration;implicit developer social network;OSS projects;core-periphery structure;power law degree distribution;GitHub","","9","","34","OAPA","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A conceptual framework for workforce analytics was developed for this purpose, together with tools and applications, that can provide useful information on different categories of activities where employees are involved. Knowledge generation is performed in four phases: collecting, processing, organizing, and analyzing the data to create valuable insights for the organization. Based on this framework, we developed a case study in an IT company, where two categories of employees, developers and software consultants, were monitored for 114 days, with 3.5 million events being generated and processed. The results showed different habits for consultants and developers, in terms of working activity structure, working schedule, inactivity time and interaction with the computer. Differences were also identified when we compared our results with previous research that monitored software developers working in-house: remote workers tend to organize their program for a longer period during the workday, and spend less time on meetings but longer time for programming. On the other hand, both categories of employees (in-house and teleworkers) show highly fragmented work, switching windows after very short periods of activity, with a potential negative impact on productivity, progress on tasks, and quality of output.

This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle.

Since there is usually no solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously, the aim is to identify a solution with acceptable trade-offs. Interactive multiobjective optimization methods are iterative processes in which a human decision maker repeatedly provides one’s preferences to request computing new solutions and compares them. With these methods, the decision maker can learn about the problem and its limitations. However, advanced optimization software usually offer simple visualization tools that can be significantly improved. On the other hand, current approaches for multiobjective optimization from the visualization community provide superior visualization tools but lack advanced optimization. In this paper, we introduce a new term, interactivize, for integrating interactive multiobjective optimization and interactive visualization and present an interactivized approach supporting decision makers in visually steering interactive multiobjective optimization methods. We integrate state-of-the-art interactive visualization with the process of interactive multiobjective optimization in a visual analytics solution that significantly improves the analysis workflow of decision makers, like comparing selected solutions and specifying new preferences during the iterative solution process. To realize the new interactivized approach, we combine a coordinated multiple views system with DESDEO, an open-source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization.

Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans.

Even though the design principles around microservices have been identified, it is difficult to have a clear view of existing research solutions for architecting microservices. In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology to identify, classify, and evaluate the current state of the art on architecting microservices from the following three perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption. More specifically, we systematically define a classification framework for categorizing the research on architecting microservices and we rigorously apply it to the 71 selected studies. We synthesize the obtained data and produce a clear overview of the state of the art. This gives a solid basis to plan for future research and applications of architecting microservices.","","978-1-5090-5729-0","10.1109/ICSA.2017.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930195","Microservices;Software Architecture;Systematic Mapping Study","Data mining;Systematics;Market research;Service-oriented architecture;Computer architecture;Architecture","software architecture","microservices;industrial adoption;enterprise world;systematic mapping","","158","","20","IEEE","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This survey discusses how blockchain systems can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this regard, eight cybersecurity issues (CIs) are identified in manufacturing systems. Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature.

The main contribution of this survey is to review requirements elicitation from the perspective of this framework and propose a road map of research to tackle outstanding elicitation problems involving tacit knowledge. Elicitation techniques (interviews, scenarios, prototypes, etc.) are investigated, followed by representations, models and support tools. The survey results suggest that elicitation techniques appear to be relatively mature, although new areas of creative requirements are emerging. Representations and models are also well established although there is potential for more sophisticated modelling of domain knowledge. While model-checking tools continue to become more elaborate, more growth is apparent in NL tools such as text mining and IR which help to categorize and disambiguate requirements. Social collaboration support is a relatively new area that facilitates categorisation, prioritisation and matching collections of requirements for product line versions. A road map for future requirements elicitation research is proposed investigating the prospects for techniques, models and tools in green-field domains where few solutions exist, contrasted with brown-field domains where collections of requirements and products already exist.

However, since the beginning of the new millennium, such KM processes have been deeply affected and molded by the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, which involves the interconnectedness of machines and their ability to learn and share data autonomously. For this reason, the present article investigates the intellectual structure and trends of KM in Industry 4.0. Bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review are conducted on a total of 90 relevant articles.

To tackle this predicament, researchers advocate the idea of coupling edge computing, or edge-cloud computing into the design of CPS. However, this coupling process raises a diversity of challenges to the quality-of-services (QoS) of CPS applications. In this article, we present a survey on edge computing or edge-cloud computing assisted CPS designs from the QoS optimization perspective. We first discuss critical challenges in service latency, energy consumption, security, privacy, and reliability during the integration of CPS with edge computing or edge-cloud computing. Afterwards, we give an overview on the state-of-the-art works tackling different challenges for QoS optimization, and present a systematic classification during outlining literature for highlighting their similarities and differences.

Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) “flying car” concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints.

This systematic review attempts to address eleven specific research questions related to the learing skills, participants, AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, evaluation parameters, intervention outcomes, generalization, and maintenance. The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible. The review also proposes the research taxonomy for ASD.

Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2022.3158270","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R030863/1); Singapore University of Technology and Design(grant numbers:SRGISTD-2021-165); Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF)(grant numbers:R5060-19); General Research Fund (GRF)(grant numbers:152221/19E,152203/20E,152244/21E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872310); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission(grant numbers:R2020A045); LEO Dr. David P.

Over the last 15 years, cognitive radio technologies have been extensively studied from algorithmic design to practical implementation. One pressing and fundamental problem is how to integrate cognitive radios into current wireless networks to enhance network capacity and improve users' experience. Unfortunately, existing solutions to cognitive radio networks (CRNs) suffer from many practical design issues. To foster further research activities in this direction, we attempt to provide a tutorial for CRN architecture design. Noticing that an effective architecture for CRNs is still lacking, in this tutorial, we systematically summarize the principles for CRN architecture design and present a novel flexible network architecture, termed cognitive capacity harvesting network (CCHN), to elaborate on how a CRN architecture can be designed. Unlike existing architectures, we introduce a new network entity, called secondary service provider, and deploy cognitive radio capability enabled routers, called cognitive radio routers, in order to effectively and efficiently manage resource harvesting and mobile traffic while enabling users without cognitive radios to access and enjoy CCHN services. Our analysis shows that our CCHN aligns well to industrial standardization activities and hence provides a viable approach to implementing future CRNs. We hope that our proposed design approach opens a new venue to future CRN research.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2017.2677082","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1343356,CNS-1409797,CNS-1423165); NSFC-Guangdong Joint Program(grant numbers:U1501255,U1301256); Guangdong Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2015A010103009); Shenzhen Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:CXZZ20150401152251212); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1343361,CNS-1350230,CPS-1646607); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1602172,CNS-1566479); Taseen käitto CWC-NS-Glisic-Menot(grant numbers:240007101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7869329","Cognitive radio networks;opportunistic spectrum access;multi-hop transmissions;spectrum auction;architectural design","Cognitive radio;Tutorials;Mobile communication;Resource management;Network architecture;Sensors;Mobile computing","cognitive radio;energy harvesting;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","cognitive capacity harvesting networks;architectural evolution;cognitive radio networks;cognitive radio technologies;unused licensed spectrum;algorithmic design;wireless networks;network capacity;CRN architecture design;cognitive capacity harvesting network;CCHN;novel flexible network architecture;secondary service provider;deploy cognitive radio capability;cognitive radio routers;mobile traffic;resource harvesting;industrial standardization activities","","50","","146","IEEE","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate each of these four facets and compare the current usage of BNs in SE with these two domains. Subsequently, we highlight the main limitations of the usage of BNs in SE and propose a Hybrid BN to improve evidence-based decision-making in SE. In two industrial cases, we build sample hybrid BNs and evaluate their performance. The results of our empirical analyses show that hybrid BNs are powerful frameworks that combine expert knowledge with quantitative data.

They are short pieces of texts in a semi-structured format that express requirements. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer a potential advantage in user story applications. Objective: Conduct a systematic literature review to capture the current state-of-the-art of NLP research on user stories. Method: The search strategy is used to obtain relevant papers from SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to filter the search results. We also use the forward and backward snowballing techniques to obtain more comprehensive results. Results: The search results identified 718 papers published between January 2009 to December 2020. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we identified 38 primary studies that discuss NLP techniques in user stories. Most studies used NLP techniques to extract aspects of who, what, and why from user stories. The purpose of NLP studies in user stories is broad, ranging from discovering defects, generating software artifacts, identifying the key abstraction of user stories, and tracing links between model and user stories. Conclusion: NLP can help system analysts manage user stories. Implementing NLP in user stories has many opportunities and challenges. Considering the exploration of NLP techniques and rigorous evaluation methods is required to obtain quality research. As with NLP research in general, the ability to understand a sentence’s context continues to be a challenge.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070606","Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency through Penelitian Disertasi Doktor(grant numbers:27/E1/KPT/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9393933","Agile software development;natural language processing;systematic review;user story","Natural language processing;Software;Requirements engineering;Agile software development;Stakeholders;Search problems;Feature extraction","data mining;digital libraries;electronic publishing;information retrieval;natural language processing;software engineering;software prototyping","user stories;NLP techniques;user story applications","","29","","75","CCBY","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people's lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance—a fundamentally conservative one—and why data science's attempts to promote “social good” dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.","2688-5255","","10.23919/JSC.2021.0029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684742","data science;ethics;politics;social justice;social change;social good;pedagogy","Training;Ethics;Social computing;Shape;Grounding;Data science;Public policy","data analysis;ethical aspects;politics;social sciences computing","social harms;social justice;data scientists;political actors;data science;data-driven algorithms;political action;ethics training;ethics principles;political orientation;normative constructions;political positions;politics","","24","","108","","18 Jan 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The size of these very large-scale conversations (VLSCs) make them difficult for participants and interested observers to understand and critically reflect upon. To facilitate understanding of the social and semantic structure of VLSCs two tools from the social sciences-social networks and semantic networks have been used and extended for the purposes of interface design. As interface devices, social and semantic networks need to be flexible, layered diagrams that are useful as a means for exploring and cross-indexing the large volumes of messages that constitute the archives of VLSCs. This paper discusses the design criteria necessary for transforming social scientific representations into interface devices.

Although there is broad acceptance that questions of professional responsibility are relevant to ICT it is often unclear how this could be achieved or how responsibilities should be defined and managed when considering the potential social consequences of ICT. `Responsible Research and Innovation' (RRI) has emerged in Europe proposing approaches for researchers to identify and consider the potential social consequences and impact of their research outputs within the entire research and innovation lifecycle. First, it asks researchers to take on a practice of critical reflection considering the potential societal impacts of their research outputs, and second to include the general public in a dialogue around the development of research goals and strategy. We discuss findings from interviews conducted with a broad range of stakeholders regarding challenges to identifying, debating and resolving social and ethical concerns associated with ICT research and practice.

We propose a context-aware task migration scheme for efficiently orchestrating the real-time collaboration among human mobile users, central and decentralized computational agents (cloud/cloudlets), and collaborative robots (cobots) across converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) communications infrastructures. We investigate the problem of whether and, if so, when and where a HART-centric task should be best migrated to. For resource-efficient task execution, the migration decision is made according to given task processing capabilities of cloud/cloudlet agents and cobots, task execution deadline, energy consumption of involved cobots and mobile devices, and task migration latency. We evaluate the performance of our context-aware HART-centric task migration scheme and compare it to conventional task execution without migration. Towards this end, we develop an analytical framework for quantifying its performance in terms of a variety of task migration key performance metrics, including task migration gain-overhead ratio, deadline-miss ratio, task response time, and energy consumption efficiency.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2018.2791406","Alexander von Humboldt (AvH) Foundation; NSERC Discovery(grant numbers:2016-04521); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252736","Cloudlet;collaborative computing;FiWi enhanced networks;human-agent-robot teamwork (HART);Tactile Internet;task migration","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Mobile communication;Energy consumption;Robots","cloud computing;Internet;mobile handsets;radio-over-fibre;ubiquitous computing","HART-centric collaboration;mobile human users;mobile HART members;collaborative node capabilities;context-aware task migration scheme;collaborative robots;converged fiber-wireless communications infrastructures;resource-efficient task execution;cobots;mobile devices;context-aware HART-centric task migration scheme;energy consumption efficiency;FiWi based tactile Internet infrastructures;human-agent-robot teamwork-centric tactile Internet applications;task processing capabilities;cloud-cloudlet agents;highway addressable remote transducer protocol","","22","","22","IEEE","9 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018189","Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation; Foundation for the School; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172001","Digital transformation;adaptive learning;computational thinking;computer science;education;information technologies;primary school;secondary school","Digital transformation;Training;Biological system modeling;Business;Cloud computing;Collaboration","computer based training;educational institutions;teaching","digital transformation;educational entities;Compagnia di San Paolo;smart communications network;Riconnessioni project;instructional process;cascade training;project activities;digital domain knowledge","","21","","68","CCBY","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids).

Because of the mobility of the devices, it is a hard task to maintain the end-to-end path between source node and destination node. Researchers have introduced analysis of nodes' social behavior to solve the problem of data dissemination in the networks, which leads to the emersion of the Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). They increase the performance of data forwarding by the social relationships and interactions among nodes. Many schemes and algorithms have been proposed to enhance data forwarding performance and provide humanized service by introducing social features and digging social properties.

This paper aims to identify and classify research on SPM approaches for GSD that are available in the literature, to identify their current weaknesses and strengths, and to analyze their applications in industry. We performed a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on six classification criteria. Eighty-four papers were selected and analyzed. The results indicate that interest in SPM for GSD has been increasing since 2006. As a class of approaches, the most frequently reported methods (40%) are those used for coordination, planning, and monitoring, along with estimation techniques that can be used to better match a distributed project. SPM for GSD requires further investigation by researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to cost and time estimations.

Generally, the high matching rate between resource and task requirements can achieve the optimal parameter configuration, whereas high-quality collaboration ensures the quality and success rates of crowd-based cooperative task. This article proposes a methodology to optimize the resource allocation model for solving CBCTA problems in a cost-efficient, requirements adapted fashion. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics to find proper resources that optimally balance matching rate and collaborative quality. We also present suitable metrics to quantify the aforementioned targets. Furthermore, the obtained solutions are ranked based on multicriteria decision making to provide a flexible design choice for decision-makers.

It can take place in remote or co-located settings. Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very complex process that involves subtle human interactions that can be described with indicators like eye gaze, speaking time, pitch, and social skills from different modalities. With the advent of sensors, multimodal learning analytics has gained momentum to detect CC quality. Indicators (or low-level events) can be used to detect CC quality with the help of measurable markers (i.e., indexes composed of one or more indicators) which give the high-level collaboration process definition. However, this understanding is incomplete without considering the scenarios (such as problem solving or meetings) of CC. The scenario of CC affects the set of indicators considered: For instance, in collaborative programming, grabbing the mouse from the partner is an indicator of collaboration; whereas in collaborative meetings, eye gaze, and audio level are indicators of collaboration. This can be a result of the differing goals and fundamental parameters (such as group behavior, interaction, or composition) in each scenario. In this article, we present our work on profiles of indicators on the basis of a scenario-driven prioritization, the parameters in different CC scenarios are mapped onto the indicators and the available indexes.

The electro-larynx (EL) is a widely used device but is known for its unnatural and monotonic speech quality. Previous research has addressed these problems, but until now no significant improvements could be reported. Moreover, the importance of human-centered computing and co-adaptation was only considered marginally. The EL speech system is a complex system including hardware (artificial excitation source or sound transducer), software (control and generation of the artificial excitation signal) and most important of all, the human user. Taking one isolated problem into consideration is not an adequate approach here, since all aspects of the EL speech system need to be integrated into a holistic approach. We have responded by pushing forward the boundaries of the conventional EL device toward a new bionic electro-larynx speech system. In this paper, we review existing approaches and summarize the most important findings. Subsequently, we piece together an overall speech system, which integrates several parts to significantly improve EL speech: we study electromyographic signals to analyze their suitability for hands-free on/off control of the EL speech system and investigate learning effects in the training of naive users. We propose a new transducer for the EL speech system based on electromagnetic mechanisms. The technical properties of the new transducer show significant advantages over the conventional electro-dynamic transducer. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to estimate a changing fundamental frequency from the speech spectral envelope and an optimized waveform shape for the excitation signal. Listening tests show that a changing fundamental frequency improves the perceived naturalness of EL speech. Listening tests serve as a proof of concept for the resulting EL speech system, which confirm that the proposed system is very promising.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2535970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7421971","Artificial excitation signal;bionic;electromyography;electro-larynx;electro-magnetic transducer;frequency estimation;speech enhancement","Speech;Transducers;Switches;Larynx;Neck;Valves","biocybernetics;biological organs;electromyography;medical signal processing;speech;speech processing","bionic electro-larynx speech system;voice;unnatural speech quality;monotonic speech quality;human-centered computing;sound transducer;artificial excitation signal control;artificial excitation signal generation;electromyographic signals;learning effects;electromagnetic mechanisms;electro-dynamic transducer;speech spectral envelope","","11","","54","IEEE","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile apps fulfil many practical purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial management, etc. Given the ubiquity of mobile apps in the lives of individuals and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to consider the relationship between human values and the development and deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values requirements.","","978-1-6654-0139-5","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS52602.2021.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402181","human values;software engineering;user reviews;text classification;mobile applications","Sentiment analysis;Transportation;Software systems;Mobile applications;Stakeholders;Data mining;Software engineering","data mining;data privacy;financial management;mobile computing;natural language processing","human values-violation;mobile software applications;common mobile apps;22 app reviews;119 app reviews;values violation detection approach;basic human values;user perceived violations;violated value categories;mining values requirements","","11","","51","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Expert judgment involves reconciling information across many, and often, conflicting criteria that describe the quality of model outcomes. In this paper, through a design study with climate scientists, we develop a deeper understanding of the problem and solution space of model diagnostics, resulting in the following contributions: i) a problem and task characterization using which we map experts' model diagnostics goals to multi-way visual comparison tasks, ii) a design space of comparative visual cues for letting experts quickly understand the degree of disagreement among competing models and gauge the degree of stability of model outputs with respect to alternative criteria, and iii) design and evaluation of MyriadCues, an interactive visualization interface for exploring alternative hypotheses and insights about good and bad models by leveraging comparative visual cues.

Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for non-instrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI. We suggest that learning technologies could use some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experience to happen, but in the end, it is the user who co-constructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving dasiasurfacespsila open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognise themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2009.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752804","Learning Technologies;User-centered design","Color;Sensors;Shape;Mood;Human computer interaction;Computers;Mobile handsets","human computer interaction","human-computer interaction;bodily interaction;emotional communication;aesthetics","","11","","54","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments.

Despite successful opening of vessels and restoration of blood flow, often in-stent restenosis (ISR) and graft failure can still occur, resulting in subsequent patient morbidity and mortality. A new generation of cardiovascular implants that have sensors and real-time monitoring capabilities are being developed to combat ISR and graft failure. Self-reporting stent/graft technology could enable precision medicine-based and predictive healthcare by detecting the earliest features of disease, even before symptoms occur. Bringing an implantable medical device with wireless electronic sensing capabilities to market is complex and often obstructive undertaking. This critical review analyses the obstacles that need to be overcome for self-reporting stents/grafts to be developed and provide a precision-medicine based healthcare for cardiovascular patients.

But can Agile methods be adapted to effectively address and deliver human values such as social justice, privacy, and sustainability in the software they produce? Human values are what an individual or a society considers important in life. Ignoring these human values in software can pose difficulties or risks for all stakeholders (e.g., user dissatisfaction, reputation damage, financial loss). To answer this question, we selected the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), one of the most commonly used Agile methods in the industry, and conducted a qualitative case study to identify possible intervention points within SAFe that are the most natural to address and integrate human values in software. We present five high-level empirically-justified sets of interventions in SAFe: artefacts, roles, ceremonies, practices, and culture. We elaborate how some current Agile artefacts (e.g., user story), roles (e.g., product owner), ceremonies (e.g., stand-up meeting), and practices (e.g., business-facing testing) in SAFe can be modified to support the inclusion of human values in software. Further, our study suggests new and exclusive values-based artefacts (e.g., legislative requirement), ceremonies (e.g., values conversation), roles (e.g., values champion), and cultural practices (e.g., induction and hiring) to be introduced in SAFe for this purpose. Guided by our findings, we argue that existing Agile methods can account for human values in software delivery with some evolutionary adaptations.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3140230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677969","Human values;scaled agile framework (SAFe);agile methods;case study","Software;Ethics;Privacy;Industries;Business;Security;Philosophical considerations","organisational aspects;project management;software maintenance;software prototyping","agile methods;business values;human values;privacy;SAFe;scaled agile framework;social justice;sustainability","","10","","105","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, to identify and highlight which agile scales practices reported in studies on Agile GSD (AGSD) are related to SAFe practices, we conducted a systematic literature review. Besides, we mapped AGSD practices to the SAFe 5.0 framework to provide bases for those starting on such a journey.

However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","2374-9709","978-1-5090-0223-8","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;cloud computing;support vector machine;feature extraction;anomaly detection","Cloud computing;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Security;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Proposals","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;Internet;security mechanisms;cloud network traffic;support vector machine;SVM;Poisson moving average predictor;feature extraction approach","","9","","20","IEEE","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of mechatronic solutions, we identified opportunities related to improved collaboration and higher quality prototyping as well as in innovative business models, which in turn created challenges in managing stakeholders. In the fully digital context, we observed opportunities in improved needfinding and the ability to offer individualized products. Conversely, we uncover difficulties in imagining digital features, estimating their feasibility, and correctly setting the fidelity of prototypes. Based on these observations, we discuss the intangibility of digital artifacts as enabler and inhibitor of Design Thinking in a digital context.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.3036818","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy(grant numbers:01MD15001D); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Program Innovations for Tomorrow's Production, Services, and Work(grant numbers:02K14A080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311704","Creativity;design engineering;design tools;innovation management;project management;research and development management;technological innovation","Technological innovation;Industries;Testing;Hardware;Software;Prototypes;Mechatronics","innovation management;mechatronics;project management;prototypes","digital innovation projects;Design Thinking;mechatronic solutions;innovative business models;digital features;digital artifacts;human-centered innovation;high quality prototyping;intangibility effects","","9","","48","CCBY","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These communities and digitized data contain both explicit and latent information about users and their behaviors related to politics and social movements. For researchers, it is essential to utilize data from these sources to develop and design systems that not only provide solutions to computational politics but also help other businesses, such as marketers, to increase users' participation and interactions.

In this tutorial, we depart from the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) versus non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) discussion held in 5G, and the conventional multi-user linear precoding approach used in space-division multiple access (SDMA), multi-user and massive MIMO in 4G and 5G, and show how multi-user communications and multiple access design for 6G and beyond should be intimately related to the fundamental problem of interference management. We start from foundational principles of interference management and rate-splitting, and progressively delineate RSMA frameworks for downlink, uplink, and multi-cell networks. We show that, in contrast to past generations of multiple access techniques (OMA, NOMA, SDMA), RSMA offers numerous benefits: 1) enhanced spectral, energy and computation efficiency; 2) universality by unifying and generalizing OMA, SDMA, NOMA, physical-layer multicasting, multi-user MIMO under a single framework that holds for any number of antennas at each node (SISO, SIMO, MISO, and MIMO settings); 3) flexibility by coping with any interference levels (from very weak to very strong), network loads (underloaded, overloaded), services (unicast, multicast), traffic, user deployments (channel directions and strengths); 4) robustness to inaccurate channel state information (CSI) and resilience to mixed-critical quality of service; 5) reliability under short channel codes and low latency. We then discuss how those benefits translate into numerous opportunities for RSMA in over forty different applications and scenarios of 6G, e.g., multi-user MIMO with statistical/quantized CSI, FDD/TDD/cell-free massive MIMO, millimeter wave and terahertz, cooperative relaying, physical layer security, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, cloud-radio access network, internet-of-things, massive access, joint communication and jamming, non-orthogonal unicast and multicast, multigroup multicast, multibeam satellite, space-air-ground integrated networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, integrated sensing and communications, grant-free access, network slicing, cognitive radio, optical/visible light communications, mobile edge computing, machine/federated learning, etc. We finally address common myths and answer frequently asked questions, opening the discussions to interesting future research avenues. Supported by the numerous benefits and applications, the tutorial concludes on the underpinning role played by RSMA in next generation networks, which should inspire future research, development, and standardization of RSMA-aided communication for 6G.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2023.3242718","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201347); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038476","Rate-splitting;rate-splitting multiple access;next generation multiple access;non orthogonal multiple access;space division multiple access;multi-user MIMO;interference management;6G","Interference;NOMA;Multiaccess communication;Interference cancellation;Downlink;5G mobile communication;Next generation networking;Tutorials","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;cellular radio;channel coding;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;edge computing;free-space optical communication;millimetre wave communication;MIMO communication;multi-access systems;next generation networks;nonorthogonal multiple access;precoding;quality of service;radio access networks;radiofrequency interference;space division multiple access;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","cloud-radio access network;grant-free access;interference management;massive access;multicell networks;multiple access design;multiple access techniques;multiuser communications;multiuser linear precoding approach;multiuser MIMO;multiuser strategy;nonorthogonal multiple access discussion;orthogonal multiple access;physical-layer multicasting;powerful multiple access;rate-Splitting Multiple Access;Rate-Splitting Multiple Access;RSMA;SDMA","","9","","243","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Overall, this provides a fuller picture to how older adults use and experience social robots in their homes. Our work involves a robot hosting period for at least a month (up to 12 months) in older adults' homes with an experience debrief session held a month into the robot hosting time period. We propose reflections on the novelty effect with respect to older adults' usage data and highlight feelings of guilt, the robot's proactivity and movement, meeting (or not meeting) user expectations, and the robot's persona as key aspects of the hosting experience that promoted usage or non-usage.

The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems. We validate the soundness of our framework with two visual analytics systems, namely Entity Workspace [8] and PatViz [37].","","978-1-4673-0014-8","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102463","Design Theory;Visual Analytics;HCI","Visual analytics;Organizations;Context;Measurement;Human computer interaction;System analysis and design","data analysis;data visualisation;decision making;organisational aspects","two-stage framework;visual analytics system design;organizational environments;organizational user decision-making;reasoning process;domain analytical process;analytical workflow;individual analytical activities;Entity Workspace;PatViz","","8","","66","IEEE","15 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.","","978-1-4673-9783-4","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347629","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques;H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—Theory and methods","Time series analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Statistical analysis;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Prediction algorithms","data visualisation;interactive systems;statistical analysis","activity recognition;visual analytics;statistical analysis;coordinated interaction","","8","","23","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wearable technologies companies have built closed-gated ecosystems around their products, preventing them to resonate with the clinical guidelines and best practices. Thus, users of these wearables find themselves torn apart between two drastically different environments; The medical healthcare environment and the wellness environment. In this paper, we explore the efforts already done to bridge that gap by analyzing the available health solutions. From this analysis, we draft guidelines for an integrated health and wellness ecosystem.

This paper discusses several shortcomings of the traditional MCCM and the Delphi method. It argues that humans' resistance to change based on a numerical rating scale follows a natural logarithm pattern instead of a linear or quadratic pattern as claimed in other studies. Hence, the traditional MCCM needs to be revised accordingly. In addition, an experiment was concluded to compare the proposed consensus-building methodology with the traditional Delphi method. The experiment showed that the proposed methodology is better than the traditional Delphi method regarding using fewer rounds to reach a consensus.

Emotional infection is considered as a social and psychological mechanism of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the innovative project, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect the effectiveness of management. The main object of creative technology is the manager or group, and the task was to educate, educate and create the organization of new behaviour in adverse, deadly and aggressive external conditions. In times of crisis, the emotional behaviour of the project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model for managing innovative projects.

Towards this goal, this paper develops an interactive tabletop board game to demonstrate a technical simulation model integrated inside a social decision-making activity. Although simplified in technical detail, the game achieves a level of realism by basing its structure and behavior on a logical model of FSS with hierarchical federation, federate, system, and subsystem constructs. A prototype game provides a physical form using a game board, mats, tokens, counters, and cards to represent key constructs. Play-testing sessions reveal insights regarding FSS including participation based on minimizing opportunity cost, legacy hardware as a barrier to participation, partnerships to overcome the initial actor problem, and frequent under-estimation of network complexity and robustness.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-5380-6","10.1109/AERO.2015.7119101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119101","","Games;Frequency selective surfaces;Modeling;Space vehicles;Collaboration;Robustness;Contracts","aerospace simulation;artificial satellites;computer games;decision making;systems engineering","interactive simulation games;federated satellite system;FSS;heterogeneous spacecraft;opportunistic data service;centralized control;system engineering method;collaborative behaviors;interactive tabletop board game;social decision-making activity;hierarchical federation;federate;play-testing session;legacy hardware","","7","","53","IEEE","8 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the social media experience and “real world” experience merge, there is an increased expectation that the norms of society will also apply in social media settings. There is an increasing demand for social media platforms to empower users with tools to report hate speech and other forms of dangerous content. There is also an increasing demand for greater quality of service in the way these reports are managed. The approach of social media companies to this problem, which is to largely avoid the issue by not publishing the data needed to assess the relevant quality of service, is being overcome by third party solutions.

The popular prioritization techniques assume that stakeholders are known and can be mandated to contribute to the prioritization process. This prerequisite no longer holds for many of today's systems where significant stakeholders (end-users, in particular) are outside organizational reach: they are neither known nor can they be identified among the members of the involved organizations. Classic techniques for involving these stakeholders such as polls or questionnaires are neither interactive nor collaborative, which is detrimental for prioritization. Social media enable collaborative prioritization, but fall short in motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to participate voluntarily. In this light, we are developing the Garuso platform, which combines social media with gamification for motivating stakeholders. While first approaches to employing gamification in RE are promising, research is still in its infancy. Especially, little is known about the influence of the gamification algorithms controlling single game elements on the stakeholders' activities. In this paper we report on a field experiment in which we investigated this influence with Garuso.

Therefore, it has been developed a web-based decision making platform fostering community participation, conceived as a modular system involving both technical surveys on physical urban degradation and perceived urban degradation assessment provided by citizens. The scope of the research concerns the involvement of citizens in urban O&M and regeneration prioritization, through advanced IT tools. The methodology exploits the functionalities of web-based survey tools feeding a digital district model: a modular information system employed as the participation platform among different stakeholders involved in the prioritization of operations in the urban environment. Data are stored and managed thanks to a Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) jointly with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Outputs are thematic maps, used by the public administration to make strategic decisions on how to invest for improvement of urban deficiencies. In this paper is presented the possibility to integrate the technical survey module, with the community involvement module. In conclusion can be stated that, the proposed methodology is a useful framework for implementation of strategies for improvement of urban quality, involving citizens' participation. Moreover, partially automates andfosters the selection of most relevant precincts where to implement interventions.","","978-8-8872-3737-5","10.23919/AEIT.2017.8240530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240530","Digital asset;web based survey;urban maintenance;community involvement;prioritization strategy","Degradation;Maintenance engineering;Urban areas;Geographic information systems;Tools;Buildings;Databases","decision support systems;geographic information systems;Internet;public administration;town and country planning","urban deficiencies;community involvement module;urban quality;community participation;geographical information systems;operation-and-maintenance prioritization;O&M prioritization;public assets;Web-based decision making platform;perceived urban degradation assessment;database management systems;urban environment;modular information system;digital district model;web-based survey tools;regeneration prioritization;physical urban degradation;modular system;public spaces;streamlined process;public administration;strategic decisions;urban degradation survey process;policy making;renewal interventions;urban maintenance prioritization","","6","","19","","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through a review of 99 research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples’ experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research.

The signification or semiosis is the key psychological process that gives sense to e-co-innovation for making ICT usage-based research, rather than technology-based. The scene develops itself in partnership with end-users to exchange data, information and knowledge. In this sharing frame, the Living Labs (LL) concept allows to emphasize the importance on political and methodological principles to practice open innovation guided by usages. On more pragmatic, scientific and technical plans, we have set up a conceptual method for making products/services based on Sign management, and a tool called the Creativity or Co-design platform, used to build iteratively e-services with pilot users (lead-users).

Recently, the emerging Building Information Modeling (BIM) gains more and more momentum in construction data presenting, processing, and sharing. With precise 3D digital geometry graphs, BIM has the potential to integrate diverse data from construction phases (design, construction, maintenance) and therefore becomes a promising collaboration platform for involved personnel. High efficiency BIM model processing is one of the critical issues for construction industry to truly embrace BIM technology. However, this topic has been rarely studied compared with other issues in BIM research. This paper presents an augmented version of MapReduce (MR), the popular distributed parallel computing model, to solve this problem. The main contribution lies in two points: 1) BIM models are extracted into uneven partitions according to construction domain features, followed by a specifically designed pre-process mechanism, which solves the unsuitability of classical MR's even blocking in construction domain and further greatly improves performance; 2) process and thread level parallel computing techniques are introduced into MR in single node to form a two-tier hybrid parallel architecture, which is more adaptive to BIM's massive graphical data processing. The proposed framework has been successfully used in real business applications of project quantity computation and BIM model collision detection. Experiment result from lab environment proves its efficiency and usability.","","978-1-4799-3776-9","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846856","MapReduce;Building Information Modeling;uneven partition","Computational modeling;Data models;Computer architecture;Buildings;Parallel processing;Business","civil engineering computing;computational geometry;construction industry;feature extraction;graphs;multi-threading;parallel architectures","augmented MapReduce framework;building information modeling applications;data management;construction data presenting;construction data processing;construction data sharing;3D digital geometry graphs;construction phases;maintenance phase;design phase;collaboration platform;BIM model processing;construction industry;BIM technology;distributed parallel computing model;construction domain features;thread level parallel computing techniques;MR;two-tier hybrid parallel architecture;BIM massive graphical data processing;project quantity computation;BIM model collision detection","","5","","21","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This was followed by the collection of qualitative data in a panel discussion with experts from academia and industry. The results reveal that Agile has an impact on how user research is conducted because of the speed of agile product development. In addition, we provide best practices of Lean User Research and show how they are applied in industry by giving practical examples. Moreover, we found that the UX community values the aspects of Lean User Research as important, but do not constantly apply it in their practical work.

Blockchain as a disruptive technology and a driver for social change has exhibited great potential to promote sustainable practices and help organizations and governments achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Existing literature reviews on blockchain and sustainability often focus only on topics related to a few SDGs. There is a need to consolidate existing results in terms of SDGs and provide a comprehensive overview of the impacts that blockchain technology may have on each SDG. This paper intends to bridge this gap, presenting a tertiary review based on 42 literature reviews, to investigate the relationship between blockchain and sustainability in light of SDGs. The method used is a consensus-based expert elicitation with thematic analysis. The findings include a novel and comprehensive mapping of impact-based interlinkage of blockchain and SDGs and a systematic overview of drivers and barriers to adopting blockchain for sustainability.

This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the relationship between values and materiality -- specifically, how researchers materialize values -- in IS research. Analysis of the literature demonstrates that IS researchers perceive the values of research subjects in their language, attitudes, design, and practices. They also materialize values at different temporal points in the research process. These materialization choices are largely independent of research method, and are an important research design consideration. Conceptualizing the materiality of values can enable values researchers to be explicit about methodological choices regarding the observation of values.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-5670-3","10.1109/HICSS.2016.254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427435","Values;Information Systems;Empirical;Literature Review","Ethics;Visualization;Information systems;Computers;Systematics;Context;Information technology","information systems","values materiality;information systems research;IS research;materialization choices;research design consideration","","5","","78","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, these sensors come with APIs as specified by the manufacturer and hence integrating newer sensors on the existing and newer platforms as well as interoperability with other platform sub-systems is highly taxing. Also, these sensors open the realm of possibilities for further automation of vehicles. Types and levels of automation are a big challenge as to how much automation is possible and should be allowed, and how to effectively use the sensors for automation and informing the vehicle crew. The NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) proposes an open architecture approach to land vehicle platform design and integration and standardises the interfaces and protocols for military vehicle systems integration. However, the NGVA does not specify any feedback mechanisms exploiting the available sensor data to support the vehicle crew. In this paper, we present a simple crew assistance system which integrates NGVA-compliant sensors and includes an adaptable rule-based interface for sensor data processing. This crew assistance system takes into consideration human factors such as human cognitive and physical workload and informs the crew members about ongoing critical events derived from available sensor data using visual, audio and haptic feedbacks in the form of alarms to increase their Situational Awareness by raising alarms on detection of specific events and making intelligent future predictions.","","978-1-5090-1777-5","10.1109/ICMCIS.2016.7496556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7496556","","Sensor systems;Automation;Haptic interfaces;Military vehicles;Software","","","","5","","31","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This will complicate the user experience due to the complexity required to figure out which of the available services are the most relevant and, also, the need for a user to install a different application (or to browse a specific Web page) for each service of interest. In this article, we introduce a method to determine in real-time the context of a user by leveraging on information gathered from both his personal devices (e.g., his smartphone, tablet and/or smart watch), his social accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). This allows to identify the physical context of the user (position, motion), his logical context (preferences, personal data). We then propose an algorithm which, starting from this contextual information, enables the discovery, the selection of the most appropriate services for a user according to his context. In addition, we have developed a single Android application to dynamically create a graphical user interface for each of the discovered services. This approach improves the user-service interaction providing a common user experience which does not depend on the type of service.","","978-1-5090-2771-2","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816843","Service discovery;Dynamic User Interface;User-Experience;Context awareness","Context;Servers;Facebook;Semantics;Web services;Androids;Humanoid robots","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;graphical user interfaces;human factors;ubiquitous computing;Web services","context-aware solution;Web service discovery;user-service interaction;public APIs;API-fication;user experience;user physical context;user logical context;Android application;graphical user interface","","5","1","14","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of microservice and docker technology, service providers can flexibly and dynamically cache microservice at the edge side to respond efficiently with limited resources. Automatically caching needed services on the nearest edge nodes and dynamically scheduling users’ requests can realize that computing power and software services flow with the users to provide continuous services. However, achieving the goal needs to overcome many challenges, such as the significant fluctuation of user devices’ requests at the edge side and the lack of collaboration among edge nodes. In this article, dynamic computing power scheduling and collaborative task scheduling among edge nodes are comprehensively developed. The problem is considered a multiobjective optimization problem, including sequentially minimizing the deadline missing rate of requests and the average task completion time. We propose an adaptive mechanism for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) in the edge environment to solve this problem. It adopts the greedy decision method to schedule computing tasks to meet their deadline requirements. At the same time, it uses the best-fit method to adjust the computing resources according to the changes of users’ requests. The simulation results show that ADCS can decrease the deadline missing rate and reduce the average completion time. Compared with DSR and CoDSR, the deadline missing rate is reduced by 59.91% and 19.95%, respectively.

This paper proposes a novel signal integrity (SI) design methodology for package of co-packaged optics (CPO) by using channel operating margin (COM) as a figure of merit (FOM) for the first time. The conventional design method of SI based on individual criteria, such as masks for loss, crosstalk, jitter, eye width/height, impedance, etc., are no longer able to be satisfied at the same time for current high-speed signals up to 50Gbps and even over 100Gbps. COM, combining most of the individual criteria into a single value of signal to noise ratio, provides the possibility to estimate the quality of the channel and achieve a balance between performance and design complexity in the early design stage. In this work, a design methodology in a format of a visible map using the most two significant factors, loss, and crosstalk, to satisfy the required COM is discussed in detail. With this novel methodology, one can predict the SI performance of a package in the early design stage when the real layout has not generated yet for full-wave simulation and can avoid the costly iteration in the conventional design concept.","","978-1-6654-4888-8","10.1109/EMC/SI/PI/EMCEurope52599.2021.9559168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559168","channel operating margin (COM);co-packaged optics (CPO);design methodology;ethernet;figure of merit;high speed;insertion loss;integrated crosstalk noise (ICN);package design;signal integrity","Optical losses;Integrated optics;Three-dimensional displays;Design methodology;Layout;Crosstalk;Predictive models","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging;integrated optoelectronics;optical crosstalk;optical losses","copackaged optics;channel operating margin;bandwidth requirement;long-touted optical integration era;signal integrity design methodology;high-speed signals;design complexity;SI performance;conventional design concept;optical engine copackaging;switching application-specific integrated circuit;figure-of-merit;signal-noise ratio;crosstalk","","5","","23","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such transformation will be enabled by means to efficiently, stably and affordably distribute electrical power from many sources and storage points.

This scenario opens up new opportunities and challenges in the creation of accessible instruments to include persons with disabilities into music practice. This work focuses in particular on instruments dedicated to people who can not use limbs, for whom the only means for musical expression are the voice and a small number of traditional instruments. First, a modular and adaptable conceptual framework is discussed for the design of accessible digital musical instruments targeted at performers with motor impairments. Physical interaction channels available from the neck upwards (head, mouth, eyes, brain) are analyzed in terms of potential and limitations for musical interaction. Second, a systematic survey of previously developed instruments is presented: each is analyzed in terms of design choices, physical interaction channels and related sensors, mapping strategies, performer interface and feedback. As a result of this survey, several open research directions are discussed, including the use of unconventional interaction channels, musical control mappings, multisensory feedback, design, evaluation, and adaptation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179732","Accessibile interfaces;music technology;digital musical instruments;inclusive music practice","Music;Instruments;Sensors;Production;Neck;Mouth","handicapped aids;music;musical instruments;user interfaces","musical expression;modular framework;adaptable conceptual framework;physical interaction channels;musical interaction;multisensory feedback;unconventional interaction channels;musical control mappings;hands-free accessible digital musical instruments;computational resources;music practice;nonconventional interaction","","4","","149","CCBY","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine extensive studies on IoT-based AFSC. Our research starts with the identification of 346 articles in the relevant field from the Web of Science (WoS) database by applying rigorous filtration. Using the VOS viewer software, a network analysis has been performed. With seven identified clusters, this article recognizes the role of IoT technologies as Cluster 1: agri-food safety, traceability and sustainability; Cluster 2: AFSC sustainability; Cluster 3: AFSC performance measurement; Cluster 4: AFSC resilience in disruption; Cluster 5: AFSC integration and traceability; Cluster 6: AFSC transparency and coordination, and finally Cluster 7 identifies the barriers in IoT adoption. Thus, findings of this study offer robust guidance to link IoT technologies and AFSCs together. Based on these findings, propositions are proposed and a research framework is established.

In general, interruptions cannot be eliminated and hence need to be handled since they are essential for activities such as interaction, event notification, automation, and so on. This paper discusses the fundamentals of system generated interruption and presents a comprehensive taxonomy that incorporates past and current works on interruption handling techniques and solutions. The paper also proposes a methodology and design process for the developing of interruption aware systems that are based on the use of knowledge gathered from users' preferences, surroundings and situations via information elicitation.

However, GSD is not a simple process as it faces multiple challenges that arise due to the mismanagement of the communication and coordination process. Meanwhile, Requirements Change Management (RCM) is a tedious and high resource-consuming process in GSD, which is further negatively affected by the poorly managed communication and coordination mechanisms. Multiple research studies have presented various theoretical and conceptual models to overcome the challenges during RCM in the GSD context. However, the current methodologies lack in handling the communication and coordination challenges during the RCM process in the GSD context. In the literature, the researchers have concluded that a conceptual model can effectively reduce the communication and coordination challenges during RCM in GSD. Inspired by this, the current work aims at proposing a conceptual model to overcome and mitigate the communication and coordination challenges, while ensuring the effective requirement changes at offshore software development sites. Moreover, it would help multiple stakeholders in understanding and managing the necessary resources before initiating the RCM process. To validate the proposed conceptual model, we have conducted a questionnaire-based survey to procure the results from the industrial experts working in the GSD domain. After analyzing the obtained results, we found that the proposed conceptual model is effective to handle the communication and coordination challenges up to 87%. In addition, almost 87% of the experts have agreed upon the correctness, identified challenges, and the mitigation practices in the proposed conceptual model necessary to improve the RCM process in the GSD context. Furthermore, it was observed that 75% of the experts also agreed upon the practical implementation of the proposed conceptual model in the software development industry to observe the heuristic performance of the proposed conceptual model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091603","COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462130","Global software development;requirements change management;communication challenges;mitigation practices;conceptual model","Software;Analytical models;Stakeholders;Social networking (online);Organizations;Context modeling","DP industry;globalisation;management of change;software development management","conceptual model;global software development;software project development;coordination process;requirements change management;GSD;RCM;offshore software development sites;software development industry;communication challenge;coordination challenge","","4","","46","CCBY","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Passive IoT can be realized with the backscatter communication (BackCom) paradigm, which uses ultra-low power, inexpensive passive tags to support massive connectivity. However, a comprehensive link budget analysis for BackCom networks has not yet been available. It is something that is necessary for practitioners and researchers to evaluate the potential of BackCom. This survey is organized as follows. First, we describe the BackCom configurations, passive IoT design targets, backscatter channel statistics, and the different components and operations of the backscatter tag. Second, we develop the forward link budget and the overall link budget. All the relevant parameters are described in detail. Third, we give numerical and simulation results to get insights on the achievable performance of BackCom networks. Since additive path losses and excess fading can limit the performance of BackCom networks, we examine potential solutions to overcome the resulting limitations, enabling massive IoT networks. We also discuss integrating BackCom with existing wireless technologies.

However, despite the best efforts of development banks, these loan funds are often lost to fraud, corruption, and collusion. In an effort to sanction and deter this wrongdoing and to ensure proper use of funds, development banks conduct extensive, costly investigations that can take over a year to complete. This paper describes a proof-of-concept of a fully automated fraud, corruption, and collusion classification system for identifying risk in international development contracts. We developed this system in conjunction with the World Bank Group - the largest international development bank - to improve the time and cost efficiency of their investigation process. Using historical monetary award data and past investigation outcomes, our classifier assigns a “risk score” to World Bank contracts. This risk score is designed to enable World Bank investigators to identify the contracts most likely to lead to a substantiated investigation. If implemented, our automated system is predicted to successfully identify fraud, corruption, and collusion in 70% of cases.","","978-1-4673-9005-7","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840752","","Contracts;Pipelines;Electronic mail;Economics;Data models;Databases;Predictive models","bank data processing;fraud;risk analysis;socio-economic effects","fraud detection;corruption detection;collusion detection;international development contracts;proof-of-concept automated system;international development banks;low-interest loans;developing countries;social development;economic development;key infrastructure projects;loan funds;fully automated fraud-corruption-collusion classification system;risk identification;World Bank Group;historical monetary award data;risk score;World Bank contracts;World Bank investigators","","4","","20","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An example is the airline system that overcharged people who were trying to escape from the Hurricane Irma. though not intentional, overlooking social values in the design of the airline system resulted in a significant dissatisfaction and loss of trust. To mitigate such value breaches in software design we propose explicitly taking into account social values in SDPs. To achieve this, we outline a collaborative framework that allows for (i) specifying the value implications of the SDPs, (ii) developing or extending SDPs for integrating social values, (iii) providing guidance on the value-conscious adoption of design patterns, (iv) collecting and analyzing insights from collaborators, (v) maintaining an up-to-date library of the valufied design patterns, and (vi) incorporating lessons learned from the real-world adoption of valuefied design patterns into the proposed framework for its continuous improvement in integrating social values into software design.","","978-1-4503-5746-3","10.1145/3194770.3194777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8452914","Design Patterns;Social Values;Framework;Fairness","Software design;Monitoring;Security;Software engineering;Ethics;Software systems","object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software maintenance","software design patterns;SDP;valuefied design patterns;value-conscious adoption;account social values;value breaches;airline system;value implications","","4","","39","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This phase is important in Zero Defect Manufacturing, where continuous adaptations are needed to avoid problems in the process. The research project has started in 2020 and an architecture is developed, that allows to transfer collaborative processes across different robotic systems. In this paper, the initial goals and the first architectural and methodological considerations leading to the conceptual design of the collaborative platform ROBxTASK are discussed. The platform enables different types of collaborative co-workers - with or without prior experience in programming - to define and adapt robotic behaviour for their work environment.

Mental illness is complex, difficult to treat, and carries social stigma. From a review of literature on bipolar disorder and interviews with bipolar disorder experts, we developed a framework for designing a persuasive monitoring system to support management of the illness. The framework applies a user-centered design process that is especially sensitive to the complexity of the illness, the difficulty of treatment, its stigma, and the goals of patients and clinicians. We describe our application of this framework to designing a persuasive mobile phone monitoring system. We discuss how our use of the framework can help overcome the special challenges posed by designing systems for mental illness: (1) accommodating a complex array of symptoms, (2) supporting an uncertain treatment process, and (3) maintaining a high level of sensitivity to the seriousness and darkness of the illness, as well as the social stigma associated with it.","2153-1641","978-1-936968-15-2","10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2011.246097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6038762","bipolar disorder;mental illness management;user-centered design;personal monitoring systems","Monitoring;Medical services;Conferences;Mood;Mobile handsets;User centered design;Biomedical monitoring","computerised monitoring;health care;human computer interaction;medical computing;mobile computing;user centred design","persuasive personal monitoring systems;persuasive personal feedback systems;mental illness;bipolar disorder;user-centered design process;illness complexity;persuasive mobile phone monitoring system;uncertain treatment process;social stigma","","4","","21","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While we are enjoying the benefits energy bring to us, we are facing challenges, such as ever-increasing energy consumption, limited energy resources, lack of robustness and resilience in response to unexpected disturbances, safety and security issues, costly impact on the environment and human health, and energy inequality. The transformation into the smart energy management system further aggravates these problems and introduces new challenges, such as the costly construction of smart facilities. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the energy system and the current status of the smart energy management system based on the framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart energy management system should take into consideration of the interaction between the smart energy management system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection management, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart energy management system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study enables us to improve preparedness, coordination & adaptiveness, safety, robustness & resilience of current smart energy management system and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption through hybrid, integrative & needed-based data acquisition, proactive communication and information sharing, adaptive decision making based on hierarchical knowledge level across spatiotemporal levels, human-involved and hybrid action.","","978-1-7281-9523-0","10.1109/UV50937.2020.9426217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426217","universal village;smart energy management;system dynamics;feedback loop;information flow;material cycle;lifestyle;community;smart city","Energy consumption;Smart cities;Decision making;Data acquisition;Robustness;Energy efficiency;Safety","building management systems;data acquisition;decision making;emergency management;energy conservation;energy management systems;feedback;health care;home automation;intelligent transportation systems;smart cities;sustainable development;town and country planning","information sharing;proactive communication;hybrid integrative needed-based data acquisition;sustainable development framework design;material cycle;information flow;smart humanity;city emergency;smart city infrastructure;crowd management;urban planning;intelligent transportation;healthcare;adaptive decision making;smart medicine;closed feedback control loop;smart home;smart response system;smart environmental protection management;effective smart energy management system;energy consumption","","4","","237","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, a reference model serving as a blueprint for ICT architectures for future cities is required - similarly as TCP/IP and ISO/OSI facilitated the growth and world-wide development of the Internet and telecommunication services. The current paper proposes a methodology for structuring the ICT landscape in a city according to emerging standards for Smart Cities on European and German level, towards the facilitation of extensible and evolvable eco-system of ICT components and stakeholders for Smart Cities.

It becomes hard to elicit the actual system requirements without identifying relevant stakeholders, leading the software project to failure. Despite the paramount importance of stakeholder identification in requirement elicitation, it has been given less attention in the software engineering literature. [Method] For this purpose, we conducted a thorough Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on stakeholder identification (SI) and its methods in requirement elicitation. However, previously, a literature study on SI in the requirement elicitation was conducted. We found that no one has proposed any standard or baseline research method for stakeholder identification, stakeholder assessment, and stakeholder interaction up to date according to our knowledge. It provides an opportunity to update the current SLR on SI in requirements elicitation from 2011 till 2021 to search for a baseline methodology for the SI. For this purpose, we explored the existing literature research that involves the SI methods in requirements elicitation. [Principle Ideas/Results] Furthermore, we identify and capture seventeen research methodologies for SI, eight key stakeholders interaction methods, and ten stakeholders assessment methods in requirement elicitation. To further enhance the stakeholder identification process, we additionally identify pivotal information such as different potential stakeholder categories, stakeholder assessments methods, and stakeholder interaction methods. Also, based on the proposed SLR, we find out the existing gaps and new opportunities for SI methods in the requirement elicitation. [Contribution] These SI methodologies help requirements engineers and practitioners identify key stakeholders and efficiently improve the requirements quality. Moreover, this research study helps identify the effective practices used for the traditional and CrowdRE SI, recover consequences that can affect the effectiveness of SI, and recommend advisable SI practices to be employed in the future. This research study would help the software researchers and developers efficiently and accurately identify correct and concerned stakeholders to improve end-user satisfaction instead of considering it a self-evident task.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152073","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University(grant numbers:RGP.2/111/43); Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714300","Stakeholder identification;stakeholder methods;requirement elicitation;SLR","Stakeholders;Software;Requirements engineering;Systematics;Software engineering;Bibliographies;Task analysis","formal specification;software development management;software engineering;software quality;systems analysis","requirements elicitation;concerned stakeholders;requirement elicitation;SI methods;key stakeholders interaction methods;stakeholders assessment methods;stakeholder identification process;stakeholder assessments methods;stakeholder interaction methods","","3","","156","CCBY","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we establish a safety and security integrated (SSI) architecture for typical industrial control systems with security measures integrated into safety failure modes. On this basis, we establish a hierarchical model of risk assessment with SSI failure mode as an element of the evaluation layer, and then standardize characteristic values of various safety-related heterogeneous index parameters. We design an entropy weight method that uses Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) method to modify the correlation of multiple indicators as a parameter strategy for determining the relative importance of element layer and evaluation layer and then use the membership function method of fuzzy statistical method to obtain the membership degree of hierarchical elements, and finally obtain the failure risk level value of equipment and system by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Based on a typical distributed control system, we build an experimental platform to test and verify the risk assessment plan, and compared with expert experience parameter method. The result shows that the scheme takes into account the correlation between indicators which measure the SSI risk level of industrial control system, and the entropy weight method is used to evaluate the risk of industrial control system which can overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of individual judgment. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation of system risk is completed by using fuzzy statistical method in the case of industrial control system without prior knowledge, and the idea of this scheme has a wide range of engineering value.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091136","Chinese Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFB1700101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461806","Security and safety integrated;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;failure mode;risk assessment;grey relation analysis","Security;Safety;Risk management;Process control;Collaboration;Industries;Entropy","analytic hierarchy process;control system security;decision making;distributed control;entropy;fuzzy set theory;grey systems;industrial control;risk management;safety;statistical analysis","fuzzy statistical method;failure risk level value;typical distributed control system;expert experience parameter method;SSI risk level;entropy weight quantitative risk assessment;typical industrial control system;quantitative integrated security;safety assessment scheme;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;safety failure modes;SSI failure mode;evaluation layer;safety-related heterogeneous index parameters;Grey relation analysis method;membership function method;FAHP;safety and security integrated architecture;element layer;fuzzy comprehensive evaluation;system risk quantitative evaluation","","3","","21","CCBY","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a natural first step, discussion has centered on how the curriculum can be meaningfully enhanced to go beyond a mere reshuffling of core content without tangible changes in pedagogy. Accordingly, we have adopted the threshold concept framework, initially developed by Meyer and Land, as a lens to view elements of the curriculum that are often considered “troublesome” for students to learn and are both transformative and integrative in nature. We opted to frame the discussion of threshold concepts in terms of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), the knowledge associated with communicating concepts in such a way that others — primarily students — can understand. To capture PCK, we used an instrument called a “content representation” (CoRe). This paper describes one element of our sequential qualitative investigation, which had three primary stages: an individual reflection with CoRe, a series of focus groups discussing and synthesizing the CoRes, and the development of a culminating card sort workshop. The findings from the focus groups will be presented, which include the set of big ideas and the associated threshold concepts within ECE from the literature.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190444","curriculum;threshold concepts;electrical engineering;computer engineering","Reflection;Fans;Stakeholders;Data collection;Education;Conferences;Instruments","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;engineering education","NSF Revolutionizing Engineering Department;Virginia Tech;electrical computer engineering curriculum;ECE;associated threshold concepts;CoRes;content representation;communicating concepts;PCK;pedagogical content knowledge","","3","","27","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Manufacturing constraints of conventional manufacturing methods, such as geometric complexity limitations and workpiece handling, have shaped the landscape of computer-aided design tools, which are therefore not suitably adapted to design for additive manufacturing. Furthermore, computer-aided design tools require a high level of training to produce appropriate models. Augmented reality and feedback technologies pose an interesting opportunity for design for additive manufacturing, whereby the interaction with 3D models in an augmented or virtual design space can provide intuitive feedback to engineers and designers, providing fast validation of designs, parametric modelling and opportunities for training and use in both professional and amateur designer communities. This paper will explore and review the opportunities this exciting new technology provides.","","978-1-7281-3401-7","10.1109/ICE.2019.8792569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792569","3D printing;augmented reality;human-machine interaction;virtual environment","Three-dimensional printing;Complexity theory;Tools;Metals;Computational modeling","augmented reality;CAD;data visualisation;rapid prototyping (industrial);three-dimensional printing","additive manufacturing;manufacturing constraints;computer-aided design tools;augmented design space;virtual design space;parametric modelling opportunities;professional designer communities;amateur designer communities;manufacturing methods;new technology;visualisation technology","","3","","75","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, various industries are turning to cloud CAE technology to design their products. However, to utilize this technology fully, we must overcome problems, such as impracticality, inability to handle complex analysis objects, poor data transmission, and compatibility, and poor industrial applicability. Based on the ASP.NET, VB.NET, and ANSYS Parametric Design Language, this paper establishes an integrated cloud CAE simulation system for industrial service applications. The system: 1) connects the dispatching manager through the network and 2) clusters the servers according to their load and usage before dispatch, thereby enabling users to access the ANSYS software remotely. The model can be built either by inputting the dimensions of the parametric model through the page or by uploading a three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) model that meets the format requirements. The material parameters and the boundary conditions also input through the page. Thus, clients can input their own parameters and analyze the server CAD. Finally, the CAE analysis results can be invoked by a page operation, saving meaningful results on the server to be accessed directly by users. The proposed simulation system serves the needs of users both quickly and efficiently. In the large-scale industrial application trials, enterprises responded favorably to the system. In particular, it properly solves the CAE analysis problems of small- and medium-sized machinery and equipment enterprises.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895956","Merit Funding for the Returned Overseas Personnel Sci-Tech Activities, Shanxi, China(grant numbers:2016); Shanxi Scholarship Council of China(grant numbers:2016-043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629037","Integrated design;APDL;CAE;digital design;load balancing;service platform","Solid modeling;Finite element analysis;Software;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Servers;Load modeling","CAD;cloud computing;computer aided engineering;finite element analysis;machinery production industries;product design;production engineering computing;small-to-medium enterprises","integrated cloud CAE simulation system;industrial service applications;cloud-based computer-aided engineering technology;product design;data transmission;ASP.NET;VB.NET;ANSYS parametric design language;ANSYS software;three-dimensional computer-aided design model;material parameters;server CAD;small- and medium-sized machinery and equipment enterprises","","3","","37","OAPA","29 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on low complexity quantization techniques in HEVC, including both fast RDOQ and all-zero block detection. In particular, the fast RDOQ relies on rate and distortion models for rate-distortion cost estimation, such that the most appropriate quantized coefficient is selected in a low complexity way. All-zero block detection infers the all-zero block by skipping transform and quantization, in an effort to further reduce the complexity.

The main goal of our research was to obtain evidence about whether or not such schemas can be useful to architecture students. A first prototype of the tool was evaluated with 78 students, with positive results. However, the students seemed to demand increased user participation, so they could contribute to generating better quality starting points. A second prototype was therefore implemented, allowing a higher degree of interactivity. The second prototype was evaluated with a new group of 50 students. From the two evaluations performed, it can be concluded that both versions of the tool were able to generate useful starting points (either automatically or interactively) that expedited the design process.

Despite its importance, most of the works on CDC have assumed homogeneous environments, where the nodes have the same storage, computing, and communication capacities. However, since many practical scenarios involve heterogeneous environments, heterogeneous CDC design is highly demanded to reduce communication load. Under consideration of full heterogeneity among workers, this paper addresses the joint design of function assignment and coded shuffling to reduce communication load effectively. We first devise a new embedded index coding (EIC) solution for the device-to-device (D2D) environment and prove its optimality. By extending our novel approach, we propose the optimal shuffling design for the MapReduce framework. Then, we figure out the optimal function assignment with the optimal shuffling design. On account of the prohibitive complexity, we propose an efficient greedy search algorithm and analyze how much performance the proposed scheme can guarantee. Numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm provides the near-optimal communication load with a considerable complexity reduction, while we observe that the function assignment design is vital for heterogeneous CDC by comparing with the well-designed file allocation design.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2022.3173726","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(grant numbers:2018-0-00809); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9772275","Distributed computing;MapReduce;data shuffle;function assignment;heterogeneous system","Indexes;Encoding;Resource management;Complexity theory;Distributed computing;Receivers;Heterogeneous networks","approximation theory;computational complexity;data handling;distributed programming;greedy algorithms;optimisation;parallel processing;resource allocation;search problems","heterogeneous coded distributed computing;large-scale MapReduce distributed computing;significant bottleneck;MapReduce computation;homogeneous environments;communication capacities;heterogeneous environments;heterogeneous CDC design;embedded index coding solution;device-to-device environment;optimal shuffling design;MapReduce framework;optimal function assignment;near-optimal communication load;function assignment design;file allocation design;EIC;D2D","","3","","44","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper deals with the modeling of pedestal fan using DFMA method. Method used for DFMA analysis is Boothroyd Dewhurst method. The aim of study is to analyse the existing design of pedestal fan and to identify the pockets of improvement and suggest the new design of pedestal fan with improved design efficiency. DFMA is a concurrent engineering tool that is used to improve the design of the product which leads to minimization of the production cost. It also shortens the product development time by reducing the number of components, increases the quality of the product as well as reduces the overall product cost by reducing the assembly cost as well as manufacturing cost. Part modelling of each component of existing design as well as improved design of pedestal fan was done with the help of design software.

However, it is still difficult for humans and robots to understand each other's intentions and motivations due to the challenges of cognition representation and behavior reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-initiative MUT approach using coactive design and graph neural networks (GNN) towards explainable human-robot collaboration. First, an interdependence analysis table is designed for a specific manned-unmanned aerial vehicle task following the coactive design principles of observability, predictability and directablity. Then, a multi-agent dynamic task assignment system is designed based on a task model with key decision-making points. Finally, we have used the Graph Network Library to design a GNN model for adjusting the LOA among the MAV and UAVs in the given task.","","978-1-7281-8025-0","10.1109/ICUS50048.2020.9274913","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274913","mixed-initiative;coactive design;dynamic task assignment;graph neural network;levels of autonomy","Task analysis;Man-machine systems;Libraries","autonomous aerial vehicles;decision making;graph theory;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;neural nets;observability;remotely operated vehicles;task analysis","interdependence analysis table;directablity;predictability;observability;specific manned-unmanned aerial vehicle task;mixed-initiative MUT approach;Graph Network Library;key decision-making points;multiagent dynamic task assignment system;coactive design principles;behavior reasoning;cognition representation;human operator;task requirements;human-robot collaboration modes;LOA;mixed-initiative decision making;graph neural network;initiative manned-unmanned teamwork","","2","","16","IEEE","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Cybernetics of Conflict Within Multi-Partner Technology and Software Engineering Programmes","R. A. Williams","Department of Management Science, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K","IEEE Access","28 May 2020","2020","8","","94994","95018","Large technology and software engineering programmes, such as enterprise system programmes, are increasingly implemented through a mixture of customer and specialist third-party resources. These multi-partner working environments can be thought of as a complex social system, which oftentimes experience various forms of conflict. This can be due to competing objectives and priorities of the various organizations, along with incompatibilities of team members within the work-based social network of the implementation programme. If not brought under control, conflict can lead to complex emergent behaviours and dynamics within the wider social network, which can severely impact the likelihood of successful programme implementation of these software-intensive systems. Using social network analysis and thematic coding analysis within a case study, we show that the project management of complex software-intensive implementations requires considerable focus on control and communication across the programme-wide social network of team members, which we represent as a cybernetic system. A conceptual framework has been developed that extends extant literature around conflict in teams by framing the individual projects and the overall programme-wide implementation as cybernetic systems. The conceptual framework illustrates how a cybernetics approach to conflict within enterprise system implementations, can provide new insights into how conflict develops within project teams. Finally, we argue that the cybernetic approach allows us to develop project management interventions to mitigate the risk of conflict development, or control and regulate conflict once it has developed. We conclude by setting the agenda for future research on how conflict can be controlled within the implementation of software-intensive systems, such as enterprise systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995263","Society for the Advancement of Management Studies-Economic and Social Research Council-United Kingdom Commision on Employment and Skills (SAMS-ESRC-UKCES) Management and Business Development Fellowship(grant numbers:ES/L002612/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9094660","Conflict;Cybernetics;Enterprise System;Software engineering project;project and programme management","Cybernetics;Software engineering;Software;Organizations;Social network services;Project management;System implementation","business data processing;cybernetics;organisational aspects;project management;social networking (online);software engineering","enterprise system implementations;programme-wide implementation;cybernetic system;programme-wide social network;complex software-intensive implementations;thematic coding analysis;social network analysis;software-intensive systems;work-based social network;multipartner working environments;specialist third-party resources;enterprise system programmes;software engineering programmes;multipartner technology","","2","","86","CCBY","18 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such speculation is one part of a larger, increasingly important question of how social robots will be expected to behave in our societies, as robotic technologies develop and become increasingly widespread. Here, to gain some insight into this topic of ""robot self-defense"", we proposed a simplified heuristic based on perceived risk of loss to predict acceptability, and conducted a user survey with 304 participants, who watched eight animated videos of robots and humans in a violent altercation. The results indicated that people largely accept the idea that a humanoid robot can use force on attackers to help others. Furthermore, self-defense was perceived as more acceptable when the appearance of the defender was humanoid rather than mechanical, and when the force disparity between attacker and defender was high. The immediate suggestion is that it could be beneficial to re-examine common assumptions that a robot should never harm or risk harming humans, and to discuss and consider the possibilities for robot self-defense.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900814","","Force;Social robots;Humanoid robots;Wheels;Mobile robots;Videos","mobile robots;social aspects of automation","social robot;robotic technologies;self-defense;humanoid robot;force disparity;human attackers;human dignity;cold robotic wheels","","2","","27","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In specific domains such as healthcare, decision-based processes are often complex and critical in terms of timing and resources. The paper presents a variety of tool-supported techniques for analyzing models of such processes. The analyses allow a variety of errors to be detected early and incrementally on partial models, notably: inadequate decisions resulting from inaccurate or outdated information about the environment state; incomplete decisions; non-deterministic task selections; unreachable tasks along process paths; and violations of non-functional process requirements involving time, resources or costs. The proposed techniques are based on different instantiations of the same generic algorithm that propagates decorations iteratively through the process model. This algorithm in particular allows event-based models to be automatically decorated with state-based invariants. A formal language supporting both event-based and state-based specifications is introduced as a process modeling language to enable such analyses. This language mimics the informal flowcharts commonly used by process stakeholders. It extends High-Level Message Sequence Charts with guards on task-related and environment-related variables. The language provides constructs for specifying task compositions, task refinements, decision trees, multi-agent communication scenarios, and time and resource constraints. The proposed techniques are demonstrated on the incremental building and analysis of a complex model of a real protocol for cancer therapy.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2014.2312954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6776491","Process modeling;process analysis;model verification;decision errors;safety-critical workflows;non-functional requirements;domain-specific languages;formal specification","Analytical models;Unified modeling language;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics;Blood;Flowcharts;Medical treatment","cancer;decision trees;formal languages;formal specification;multi-agent systems;patient treatment","critical decision-based process analysis;tool-supported techniques;partial models;environment state;incomplete decisions;nondeterministic task selections;unreachable tasks;process paths;nonfunctional process requirement violation;event-based models;state-based invariants;formal language;event-based specification;state-based specification;process modeling language;informal flowcharts;high-level message sequence charts;task-related variables;environment-related variables;task compositions;task refinements;decision trees;multiagent communication scenarios;time constraints;resource constraints;cancer therapy","","2","","80","IEEE","20 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This knowledge, in general, is dispersed through several, frequently unidentified, individuals. Collecting, filtering and putting together the relevant knowledge pieces to create solutions are difficult tasks. Many domains fit this scenario of distributed knowledge and creative solution's needs including governmental decision-making. Democratic governments constantly need to make sense of population demands to properly make decisions that attend overall will. However, low citizens participation in government decisions through democratic processes is an aspect that defies democracy itself. Large-scale citizens participation is difficult for the lack of technology to collect, filter and synthesize information. To deal with this problem, we developed an intelligent mobile network that allows broad citizens' participation and feasible government action. Previous research indicates cellular phones as the device with the broadest acceptance in all Brazilian social classes. Sending messages and voting by cell phones are broken barriers to consider the device as the natural input interface for citizen-government interaction. Additionally, message summarization and clusterization help government understand the demands.

"The first cohort in a new innovation, leadership, and engineering entrepreneurship B. S. degree program","B. S. Newell; L. R. Varshney",College of Engineering; Coordinated Science Laboratory,"2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","14 Dec 2017","2017","","","1","6","The College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has recently launched a new B. S. dual degree in Innovation, Leadership, and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE), a second bachelor's degree option for those completing their degree in a traditional engineering discipline. This is unlike many universities where similar degree programs are situated in colleges of business rather than engineering. The first cohort of sixteen students has joined the program in January 2017. In this paper we first report on the stated goals of the new degree, which is meant to combine the technical expertise in the traditional engineering science-focused disciplines with a deeper set of skills in problem-finding, creativity, innovation, leadership, and externalization. The idea is to ensure training in the dual physical and human dimensions and triple aspects of science, design, and leadership that are present in engineering practice. Next we report on the curriculum design as well as the experiential learning pedagogy that is present in most of the courses therein. Core courses include “Design Thinking/Need-Finding”, “Creativity, Innovation, Vision”, “Emotional Intelligence”, “Innovation and Engineering Design”, and “Technology Entrepreneurship”. Further, we provide a characterization of the students in the first cohort of undergraduate students to be accepted into the degree program. Drawing on their application materials, we perform text analytics using techniques such as topic modeling under Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and geometric embedding using the word2vec family of methods, to understand the key motivations for students to pursue this degree. Finally we use these text analytics techniques to make a formal assessment of alignment between the stated goals of the degree program and the key motivations of the students. One particular question is to understand the students' relative level of interest in the three legs of the degree, namely innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship, so as to predict how level of engagement may vary across courses.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190631","innovation education;leadership education;engineering entrepreneurship education;text analytics","Technological innovation;Entrepreneurship;Creativity;Engineering students","educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;innovation management","innovation;leadership;engineering entrepreneurship;traditional engineering discipline;traditional engineering science;human dimensions;engineering practice;design thinking/need-finding course;innovation and engineering design course;technology entrepreneurship course;creativity innovation vision course;emotional intelligence course;latent Dirichlet allocation;geometric embedding;word2vec method;LDA","","2","","21","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To explicitly and formally specify the ontological views, a Frame-based Ontological view Specification Language (FOSL) is proposed. This language is based on the Frame knowledge representation paradigm and uses XML as the encoding.

However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve proficiency with 3D visualizations. Because 3D representations are key to understanding the neutron scattering data, scientists are unable to analyze their data in a timely fashion resulting in inefficient use of the limited and expensive SNS beam time. We believe a more intuitive interface for exploring neutron scattering data can be created by combining immersive virtual reality technology with high performance data analytics and human interaction.

More than ever, in order to protect the citizens, cities need to rely on data to address such a public health emergency. In this sense, the Urban Control and Command Centers (CCCs) are an important governance organism to help the monitoring and the management of the complex dynamic of contemporary cities. These centralized and integrated management structures in the form of a governmental agency can aid the decision makers into a more coordinated, systemic, strategic, and data-driven intervention. In Rio de Janeiro's case, the city Urban CCC - called Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR in the Portuguese abbreviation) - is mostly designed to monitor the daily routine of the different systems and infrastructures that compose the city's dynamic, to plan and integrate operations for big events like Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to manage emergency situations. With the monitoring center, Rio is able to identify abnormalities and make sure that any interference in the city can be resolved in a timely manner, in order to ensure that the city comes back to normal in the face of a disruption and runs as smoothly as possible. Regarding the context of the pandemic of the COVID-19, Urban CCCs can also be an important tool to manage health emergencies.

The research is multidisciplinary in nature. The goals will be accomplished through the development of an integrated robotic framework that includes a novel architecture and an interactive user interface to gather information using methodologies recommended for forensic interviews with children. The Interactive Social Engagement Architecture (ISEA) is designed to integrate behavior-based robotics, human behavior models, cognitive architectures, and expert user input to increase social engagement between a human and system (e.g., robot, avatar, etc.). ISEA provides for the autonomous generation of robot behaviors for self-preservation and to convey social intelligence. The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable to different applications and domains; however for this project, the focus is on social engagement for information gathering. The interactive user interface provides interviewers with the ability to use a robot as an intermediary for gathering this information. The interface and framework have been iteratively improved through observations from user studies conducted to date with 186 children ages 8-12. This project compares the effectiveness of robot versus human interviewers to gather sensitive information from children using situations in which this would commonly occur - cases of child eyewitness memory and child reports of bullying. This research has the potential to transform how sensitive information is gathered as it relates to criminal investigations and proceedings.","","978-1-5090-5655-2","10.1109/SAMI.2017.7880307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880307","","Robot sensing systems;Interviews;Forensics;User interfaces;Protocols;Robot kinematics","human-robot interaction;interactive systems;user interfaces","intelligent interactive social engagement framework;information gathering;integrated robotic framework;interactive user interface;interactive social engagement architecture;ISEA;behavior-based robotics;human behavior models;cognitive architectures;robot behavior autonomous generation;social intelligence;child eyewitness memory;child bullying","","2","","25","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have examined various aspects of LA infrastructure, such as ethical trade-offs and stakeholder needs. However, strategies for designing technical LA infrastructure at the institutional level and strategies for dealing with data protection regulations have been lacking so far, although they are crucial for the adoption of LA in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to examine three research questions: (RQ1) which strategies are currently used to design LA infrastructure; (RQ2) how data protection and privacy affect the design of LA infrastructure; and (RQ3) how could technical measures support the adoption of LA. These research questions were investigated by conducting eleven interviews with LA infrastructure developers representing eight different higher education institutions and ten different infrastructures. According to RQ1, the paper first examines the domain specificity of LA infrastructure and the four design strategies used. The paper also examines, according to RQ2, the interviewees’ awareness of data protection, the conflict with users’ consent, and the data subject rights. Finally, the paper presents, in line with RQ3, the results of the strategies in dealing with trust, stakeholder expectations, and engagement.

In order to understand and respond to these challenges, a 3-day workshop was organized in Montreal to gather information from stakeholders, i.e. users on the spectrum, family members and persons who work with them in educational, work, and cultural settings, on the potential uses and ethical issues of biomusic. In this paper, we report some of the outcomes of this workshop from a design perspective, which we used to generate a framework for biomusic as affective technology. This framework proposes three distinct lenses: a technological one, an ecological one, and a human-centered one.

Potential benefits include improved productivity, decreased production costs, better operational efficiency, increased safety, reduced waste and, ultimately, more value creation. The increasing amount of robotics used in the raw materials sector is coupled with a series of ethical and legal issues, regulatory challenges and policy requirements that affect both producers and end-users of robotic technologies.

How can the effectiveness of technological solutions for security be proven and measured, and how can this technology be aligned with the governance and financial goals at the board level? These are the essential questions for any CEO, CIO or CISO that is concerned with the wellbeing of the firm. The concept of Zero Trust (ZT) approaches information and cybersecurity from the perspective of the asset to be protected, and from the value that asset represents. Zero Trust has been around for quite some time. Most professionals associate Zero Trust with a particular architectural approach to cybersecurity, involving concepts such as segments, resources that are accessed in a secure manner and the maxim “always verify never trust”. This paper describes the current state of the art in Zero Trust usage. We investigate the limitations of current approaches and how these are addressed in the form of Critical Success Factors in the Zero Trust Framework developed by ON2IT ‘Zero Trust Innovators’ (1). Furthermore, this paper describes the design and engineering of a Zero Trust artefact that addresses the problems at hand (2), according to Design Science Research (DSR). The last part of this paper outlines the setup of an empirical validation trough practitioner oriented research, in order to gain a broader acceptance and implementation of Zero Trust strategies (3). The final result is a proposed framework and associated technology which, via Zero Trust principles, addresses multiple layers of the organization to grasp and align cybersecurity risks and understand the readiness and fitness of the organization and its measures to counter cybersecurity risks.","","978-1-6654-8864-8","10.1109/STC55697.2022.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951014","Zero Trust;validation;security strategy;risk management;compliance","Insurance;Organizations;Time measurement;Software;Real-time systems;Zero Trust;Software measurement","business data processing;organisational aspects;research and development;risk management;security of data;trusted computing","compliance;cybersecurity risks;design science research;DSR;ON2IT Zero Trust innovators;organization;Zero Trust framework;Zero Trust implementations;Zero Trust usage;Zero Trust validation","","2","","37","IEEE","18 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This challenge stems from having many stakeholders and design trade-offs involved, which cause uncertainty in defining the problem, eliciting soft requirements, and making design trade-offs among many contending objectives. As creating a formal model of such settings is often infeasible, applying a conventional engineering design method alone may not result in elucidating users' needs and/or devising a viable design that is acceptable for all parties (e.g., end-users and data subjects). This contribution aims at enriching engineering approaches for privacy-protecting ISs with the so-called design-thinking approach. Design-thinking, initially used for product and service design, has been applied to the areas where there are interactions among people, organizations and technologies, in order to elucidate user needs and concerns that are insufficiently formulated and/or hidden in tacit knowledge. In this contribution, we elaborate on three main PbD components, namely problem space, solution space and mapping space. We, further, analyze the shortcomings of traditional engineering approaches for privacy protection as well as the potentials and shortcomings of design-thinking in general. Finally, we present our practical experience with applying the design-thinking approach to the problem of PbD for ISs. We foresee the applicability of design-thinking for elucidating the problem space as well as for making design trade-off among contending values in order to come up with a viable design option.","","978-1-7281-6741-1","10.1109/TPS-ISA48467.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014358","design methods, design-thinking, information systems, privacy engineering, privacy protection","IEC Standards;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Conferences;Privacy;Security;Intelligent systems","data protection;design;information systems","design trade-off;privacy-protecting ISs;design-thinking approach;problem space;privacy-protecting information systems;PbD components;solution space;mapping space","","2","","38","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Societies confronted with these complex challenges need to manage synergies and trade-offs across multiple systems, scales and levels of analysis. Unfortunately, if the goal is to overcome each of these challenges separately, we must embrace convergence as a means to merge disciplines, methodologies, and technologies, and we must do this for every one of the challenges, which is a truly daunting, and perhaps even impossible, task. Fortunately, however, societal challenges of the Anthropocene share the abstract common characteristics of broad scope, complex interdependencies, and multi-faceted causality, and also share several common systems. Seizing on this conceptual opportunity, we evaluate the “convergence potential” for systems-of-systems engineering methods. We then present a way forward that addresses the unique characteristics of Anthropocene systems by developing an agile systems-of-systems engineering framework and associated decision-support system to integrate fragmented data and disciplinary knowledge into a new systemic understanding.

Therefore, this paper presents a proposal of a methodology inspired by two other methodologies, which complement each other in order to provide the continuous, effective and rapid improvement of cities. This methodology was called Urban Continual Improvement and is composed by the 4U-Cycle (inspired in the PDCA Cycle) and the Agile Model for Urban Continual Improvement (based on the Scrum Methodology).

We plan to realize multidisciplinary research and innovation actions to achieve the following objectives: understanding the mental health conditions, preventing disruptive mental disorders and their early diagnosis, and mind gymnastic treatment. The target of this research is to influence mental conditions that lead to some mental disorders, such as depression, dementia, sedentariness, cognitive decline and personality disorders, which are present in older people, but can also be experienced earlier. The initial, understanding phase includes scanning mind activities using different audio-visual stimuli, by applying the sophisticated fMRI and EEG technologies to identify the regions of the brain that demonstrate increased activation with positive stimuli. Prevention is based on analysis and correlation of the results and will enable the development of a methodology for increasing mind activities drawing on the conclusions from experts about which audio-visual stimuli support the best mind gymnastic; as well as matching the results on various socio-economic, gender, religious, environmental and physical factors. An interactive system based on recommended audio-visual content, IPTV, social networks, cloud enabled devices and applications will be developed as a prototype tool for creating everyday mind gymnastics. Early diagnosis of mental reactions will be determined by EEG or fMRI technologies for various stimuli, enabling conditions to detect abnormal changes in the brain activity. This paper gives an overview of current research and projects in the area. It defines the basic objectives of planned MindGym research activities.","","978-1-4673-7290-9","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7259403","MindGym;cloud computing;IPTV;elderly health care;social inclusion","Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Indexes;Electronic mail;Telemedicine;Digital video broadcasting","biomedical MRI;brain;cloud computing;cognition;electroencephalography;geriatrics;interactive systems;medical disorders;neurophysiology;social networking (online)","intellectual health;elderly people;life quality;older citizens;caregivers;mental health conditions;mind gymnastic treatment;depression;dementia;sedentariness;cognitive decline;personality disorders;audio-visual stimuli;mind activities;socio-economic factors;gender factor;religious factor;physical factor;environmental factor;interactive system;recommended audio-visual content;IPTV;social networks;cloud enabled devices;mental reaction diagnosis;fMRI technologies;EEG fMRI;EEG technologies;MindGym research activities","","1","","30","IEEE","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the potential remedies for ensuring success for infrastructure projects of significant social impact relies on building tight collaborations. These call for experimentation with different mechanisms that have the potential to improve project outcomes and maximise end-user benefits. We consider the potential to contribute to the successes of socially impactful infrastructure projects by piecing together a range of smaller less-related projects that are funded, monitored and supported through the mechanism of cascade funding. With the assumption that the product of combined projects is more impactful than the sum of their contributions, we demonstrate a representative example of several successful use cases that, when combined, enhance the digitalization of water utilities and help maximise the impact of complex multi-faceted issues that are often entangled in large projects.","2687-8860","978-1-6654-8561-6","10.1109/ISC255366.2022.9922322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922322","Cascade Funding;Water infrastructure;Cooperative Experiments;Innovation;Sustainable Impact;Digitization","Technological innovation;Smart cities;Instruments;Project management;Stakeholders;Risk management;Water resources","government policies;human factors;innovation management;organisational aspects;project management;public administration;risk management;technology management","human factors;risk management;potential remedies;significant social impact;building tight collaborations;project outcomes;end-user benefits;socially impactful infrastructure projects;less-related projects;cascade funding;combined projects;successful use cases;water utilities;innovation;smart cities;water management;infinitely long list;original budget;fast-acting cure","","1","","18","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In combination with inadequate practices regarding the conduct of data, difficulties in the adoption of data governance can increase. This article draws upon established practices from information technology governance and organizational theory, specifically contingency theory, to examine occurring antecedents in the adoption of data governance at Thales Ground Transportation Systems, a manufacturer of solutions for the railway infrastructure. By investigating the nomological link between antecedents, adoption, and consequences, associated implications for data governance can be taken into account in early phases of adoption to promote data-driven innovation.

Second, we collaborate the ultra-lightweight algorithms through a centralized-distributed architecture to achieve intelligent upgrading of the whole system. Then, by maximizing the use of resources and information, we accomplish a heterogeneous ultra-lightweight multi-robotic collaborative system.

Concrete examples on a tanks system and an industrial paste thickener are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3217535","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo(grant numbers:ANID PIA ACT192013); ANID-Subdirección de Capital Humano/Doctorado(grant numbers:Nacional/2021-21210220); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9931427","Industrial automation;industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs);intelligent control","Service-oriented architecture;Containers;Virtualization;Process control;Libraries;Informatics;Standards","computer network security;cyber-physical systems;industrial control;production engineering computing","automatic synthesis;containerized industrial cyber-physical systems;core technologies;generation industrial control systems;ICPS synthesis;ICPSs;industrial agents;industrial paste thickener;ongoing fourth industrial revolution;process description file;tanks system;underlying physical process","","1","","37","IEEE","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger’s Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm’s history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883298","Software engineering;ethnography;participant observation;communities of practice;mentoring","Software;Mentoring;Maintenance engineering;Software engineering;History;Employment;Computer bugs","DP industry;employee welfare;software process improvement;software prototyping","agile workplace;agile software development;community of practice;software practice;self-determined trajectories;employees;newcomers;software development firm;mentoring;Scrum","","1","","15","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration.

For this reason, an informative questionnaire is prepared to take the expert opinions on the main drivers that shape the energy consumption behavior of Syrian refugees. In total, 17 experts are interviewed. The answers are explored by using NETICA software for Bayesian Belief Networks. Factors affecting energy consumption behavior and also strategies, institutions, tools, and financing methods that change the behavior toward efficient consumption are investigated. Based on obtained results, it can be claimed that to be successful, electricity prices and tariffs in the market should be arranged in the favor of energy efficiency. Besides, support mechanisms by not only the government but also by the municipalities should be considered while setting related policies. Also, electric appliance producers should develop and implement strategies and actions to encourage the usage of more efficient appliances.

This is the case for history, geography, the earth sciences, and other subjects. However, so far, little has been done to provide adequate learning tools that can support such an important transformation. This paper proposes the integration of advanced geospatial technology in traditional interactive learning tools as a way to describe experiences that help students understand phenomena and improve their competencies. The system is the result of a usability engineering process aimed at providing users with an effective learning experience, iteratively analysing their expectations and needs with respect to geo-referenced content. The resulting learning environment, Maps4Learning, allows users to manage content in terms of learning objects named geoLO+, which are extended with spatial and temporal components and built according to standardized metadata. The system was tested in the context of a middle school programme. A usability study was carried out to analyse the impact of geoLO+ resources in terms of perceived quality, engagement, and student learning performance, and the outcomes of the resources were compared to the outcomes of traditional teaching methods. The results were encouraging and showed that learning improvement can indeed be achieved using Maps4Learning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993507","MIUR, PRIN 2017(grant numbers:2017JMHK4F_004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090175","E-learning;geographic information;user experience;usability engineering;visual environment;Dublin core","Electronic learning;Ontologies;Geology;Geography;Tools;Usability","computer aided instruction;geographic information systems;meta data;teaching","Maps4Learning;student achievement;high school curricula;relevant geographic information;interactive learning tools;effective learning experience;learning environment;middle school programme;student learning performance;learning improvement;geo-education;geospatial technology;geoLO+;metadata","","1","","33","CCBY","8 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motivated by this new design direction, this work takes an iterative design approach to explore how we design triadic interactions through ""lived technology experiences"" and interviews. For 3-6 weeks, we deployed and remotely teleoperated a social robot in the homes of 12 families with 3-7-year-old children to engage in a triadic story reading activity with both parent and child for six 25-min sessions. Before and after the deployment, we conducted a semi-structured interview with participants on their triadic interaction experience and desired robot design features. The results of our qualitative analysis show that social robots can improve various aspects of parent-child interaction.

Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device.

While the work on cyber resilience is evolving, there is a lack of studies using qualitative data for investigating the concepts and themes pertaining to cyber resilience in organizations. The purpose of this study is to uncover the non-technical organizational factors that contribute to better cyber resilience. By adopting a qualitative approach of analyzing factors of organizational resilience, this paper uses primary data collected through 25 interviews at senior leadership or board-level to point out the extent to which these factors facilitate or impede cyber resilience. The study illustrates a Leximancer map of each factor that characterizes organizational cyber resilience, based on insights from cyber practitioner communities through narrative interviews. This research contributes to a better theoretical and practical understanding of how cyber resilience within organizations can be improved. The findings show that cyber strategy and skilled people playa key role in adoption of cyber culture at the management level, while communication between boards and security leadership as well as a clear reporting structure are signals for building cyber resilience.","","978-1-6654-6122-1","10.1109/ICCR56254.2022.9995762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995762","socio-technical factors;qualitative data;organizational cyber resilience;Leximancer concept maps;board-leadership communication;skilled workforce","Industries;Leadership;Collaboration;Information sharing;Organizations;Security;Stakeholders","organisational aspects;security of data","business objectives;cyber strategy;Leximancer map;nontechnical organizational factors;organizational cyber resilience;security leadership","","1","","36","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This suggests that the boundary between the fields of market research and CrowdRE has become blurred. This in turn raises the question: When is something still CrowdRE, and when has it become market research? This is an important question because it may require the community to rethink how industry might perceive CrowdRE in a wider context, and how future research should be framed.

This paper begins with a review of the literature used to guide the development of this macroethics lesson. Next, the outline and content of the lesson is presented which consisted of two distinct activities. The first was an introductory presentation on ethics and identifying personal values. This was followed by students choosing an “issue brief” (written by the authors of this paper) on a current macroethical issue in aerospace engineering. The brief topics were the military-industrial complex, space sustainability and orbital debris, and space settlement and resource utilization. After reading their selected brief, students engaged in a structured discussion on the issue in which they identified and ranked stakeholders, and reflected on how their own values were reflected in their ranking of stakeholders. This paper concludes with a discussion of the impact and effectiveness of the lesson with reflections from the authors, and presents quantitative and qualitative survey data from the sophomore students who completed the macroethics lesson.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637172","University of Colorado Boulder Engineering Excellence Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637172","Ethics;Social Responsibility;Sophomore;Aerospace Engineering","Space vehicles;Ethics;Engineering profession;Space debris;Stakeholders;Sustainable development;Springs","aerospace engineering;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;ethical aspects","identifying personal values;macroethical issue;sophomore students;aerospace macroethics lesson;ethical issue;sophomore-level aerospace engineering course;learning objective;military-industrial complex","","1","","28","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As flipped classroom models of instruction have gained popularity in higher education, it has prompted the need for an investigation into content-specific methods for flipped curriculum design. Our work identified and implemented flipped classroom design factors in an Advanced Database Design (CIT 44400) course to address a gap in research around flipped classroom models within undergraduate data-science courses. Through literature review, we identified a set of eight factors of effective flipped classroom instruction and evaluated them via survey, focus group, course evaluation, student performance, and interview data. We segmented designed course activities which incorporated these eight factors with a set of learning objectives that emphasized collaborative iterative practices to position students as designers and evaluators of solutions to industry-authentic problems. Instructional design factors were evaluated via course evaluations and student surveys followed by an activity-based qualitative analysis of focus group, instructor interview, and student free-response data to understand student perceptions of instructional approaches, intended versus practical outcomes of such activities, and guidelines for future course design iterations and research. We argue instructional design must be student-centered and consider student goals alongside those that are ‘scripted’ into the course structure to best serve, motivate, and engage students. During the Fall 2020 implementation of CIT 44400, we prioritized learner independence, peer collaboration, and critical thinking in the instructional design, selecting flipped methodologies with the intention of fostering these skills in senior students. In light of Covid-19, the course was adapted to be synchronous online. Regardless of these unforeseen constraints, student performance and course evaluation data indicate that with peer and instructor feedback, students were able to apply course content appropriately in their final independent project as evidenced by a 12% increase in assessment scores and an improvement in students average overall final course grades from a ‘B’ to an ‘A-’ as compared to the previously taught Fall 2019 lecture-based section of the same class. Course evaluation scores also improved from 3.22 to 3.66 from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. Self-reported survey data from students indicate that (a) feedback from the instructor, (b) small group work, (c) revision of work based on feedback, and (d) solution evaluations were the most positively impactful instructional design elements throughout the course. In particular, students mentioned one-on-one scaffolding from the instructor as beneficial for their learning. Students also communicated challenges faced during the pandemic, complaints, and recommendations for future course iterations. Data from focus group discussions conveyed that students (a) generally had positive learning experiences despite the constraints of learning exclusively online and (b) developed the industry-specific collaborative practices which were designed into the forefront of our instructional model. The flipped classroom design and implementation process in this research is transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to design a domain-specific flipped model for their classroom which considers the needs of one's students, the challenges of the current time, and the state of the field at large.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637247","Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637247","Flipped Classroom;Data Management Education;Activity Theory","Pandemics;Databases;Design methodology;Education;Collaboration;Data models;Online services","computer aided instruction;computer science education;database management systems;educational courses;epidemics;further education;groupware;human factors;Internet;teaching","instructional design factors;student surveys;activity-based qualitative analysis;focus group;student free-response data;CIT 44400;senior students;course evaluation data;instructional design elements;industry-specific collaborative practices;domain-specific flipped model;flipped classroom instruction;remote synchronous flipped classroom implementation;senior-level data management course;flipped curriculum design;flipped classroom design factors;undergraduate data-science courses;collaborative iterative practices;advanced data management course;higher education;content-specific method;advanced database design course;instructor interview;peer collaboration;critical thinking;Fall 2019 lecture-based section;pandemic","","1","","16","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a huge amount of knowledge created and communicated during the entire process that needs to be managed in a structured manner incorporating both explicit and tacit knowledge. There is a lot of difficulty in documenting the tacit knowledge and consequently misunderstood or ambiguous stakeholder needs have aroused the researchers to devise techniques and models to minimize these difficulties. Due to the complexity of new arising systems, it has become difficult to understand the needs of stakeholders properly even with using the traditional models. Therefore, there is still not a widely accepted solution to all the problems faced in managing requirements.

The dominant curriculum models for software engineers has focused on the solution space's declarative knowledge and has mostly relegated problem solving skills to that of a consequence of the primary educational process. In this paper we present a constructivist aware strategy to amend software engineering curricula by integrating problem solving skill development. To build this approach we examined mathematician Gyorgy Polya's heuristic of a generalized problem solving model in the context of software engineering (SE) and propose the necessary augmentation to support skill development. We take the position that Polya's approach may not only functionally address well defined problems encountered at an introductory level but is expandable to tackle ill-structured or wicked problems inherent in the design of complex systems. We present a controlled classroom study which investigates the utility of the proposed methodology to address a set of welldefined problems in a small representative student sampling.

Allowing new communication services with virtual existence and involvement everywhere is likely to redefine and place new demands on how humans can and wish (or do not wish) to engage with the connected network. The ubiquitous nature of the 6G network evolution enables increased involvement and affords more power to networks and machines (and those designing them) versus humans. This paper advocates that human-centric 6G networks should put humans' interests and potential first and foremost, in a holistic manner. There is a need to critically monitor, (r)evaluate, and adjust the above power implications. Human-centric design perspectives applied to future network technologies incorporate the human element more broadly. Thus, meaningful user control, empowerment, and agency should be key features of future network technologies beyond 5G and 6G. The network system's ability to protect human potential and humanity first, to serve multiple normative standards, while balancing the interests of all parties, can become a catalyst for stimulating better governing practices and for managing consensus building between individuals, communities, governments, and networked machines embedded with human-like capabilities. However, realising this vision and potential requires a thorough alignment with the human- and humanity-centric paradigm and a renewal of its operationalisation and implementation. This paper overviews a set of human-centric design interpretations and discusses the next challenges and implications in a beyond 5G and 6G context.","","978-1-6654-1376-3","10.1109/ICT52184.2021.9511537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511537","human-centric theory;democratization;power;user involvement","6G mobile communication;Measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Telecommunications;Resource management;Standards","6G mobile communication;human factors;user centred design","networked machines;communication networks;communication services;connected network;human-centric 6G networks;human-centric design perspectives;future network technologies;network system;humanity-centric paradigm;human-centric paradigm","","1","","42","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, individuals who are blind are not able to independently learn and operate several categories of physical products. In this paper, we propose a system for rendering the User Interface (UI) of physical devices and products accessible to individuals with disabilities, with specific regard to people who are blind. To this end, we introduce the concept of Interface Digital Twin (IDT), that is, a digital replica of the physical UI that leverages the accessibility features of mobile devices (e.g., vibration and text-to-speech) to render the interface accessible, help individuals understand its components and learn how to operate it, and support users in accomplishing their tasks on the actual device. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it can be integrated in current technology without requiring any modification.

However, the realisation of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavoured to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SMEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SMEs in Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporationpsilas (BSCIC) 70 industrial estates is still in its infancy. One of the factors that have been identified as impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SMEs is access to, and confidence on ICT.

However, numerous examples exist of data-driven software perpetuating societal inequities and further marginalizing populations. How do we attend to software fairness? What are the best approaches for software engineers to be more conscious of the harmful impacts on the most vulnerable within our communities? Prior work recommends new tools to resolve the unfair and biased outcomes; however, the issue of biased inequitable software technology is an interdisciplinary problem that we can no longer solely depend on technical solutions. Instead, we need to incorporate interdisciplinary methods to help address the inequity of software technology.

In this paper we therefore explore the use of ChatGPT for generating user stories that describe candidate human values. These generated stories provide inspiration to stakeholder discussions and enrich the human-created user stories. We engineer a series of ChatGPT prompts to retrieve a list of common stakeholders and candidate features for a targeted product, and then, for each pairwise combination of role and feature, and for each individual Schwartz value, we issue an additional prompt to generate a candidate user story reflecting that value. We present the candidate user-stories to stakeholders and, as part of a creative requirements engineering session, we ask them to assess and prioritize the generated user-stories, and then use them as inspiration for discussing and specifying their own product-related human values. Through conducting a series of focus groups we compare the human-values created by stakeholders with and without the benefit of the ChatGPT examples. Results are evaluated with respect to coverage of values, clarity of expression, internal completeness, and through feedback from our participants. Results from our analysis show that the ChatGPT-generated user stories are able to provide creativity triggers that help stakeholders to specify human values for a product.","2770-6834","979-8-3503-2691-8","10.1109/REW57809.2023.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260859","Human values;Creative requirements elicitation;User stories","Conferences;Computed tomography;Chatbots;Software systems;Grammar;Complexity theory;Stakeholders","formal specification;human computer interaction;systems analysis","candidate features;candidate human values;candidate user story;candidate user-stories;ChatGPT prompts;ChatGPT-generated user stories;common stakeholders;developing deploying software systems;generated user-stories;human-created user stories;human-value user stories;human-values;individual Schwartz value;product-related human values","","","","47","IEEE","28 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, a GPU accelerated scalable computational framework, which can enable real time follow-up observation, is designed. This framework efficiently divides the algorithm between CPU and GPU, accelerating large scale light curve processing to meet low latency requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed method can process 200,000 stars (the maximum number of stars processed by a single GWAC telescope) in approximately 3.34 seconds with current commodity hardware while achieving an accuracy of 92% and an average detection occurring approximately 14% before the peak of the anomaly with zero false alarm.

The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few.","2377-6919","978-1-7281-1780-5","10.1109/GHTC46095.2019.9033080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033080","water treatment;IoT;maker space;mobile solutions;humanitarian sanitation;arduino;raspbery pi","Prototypes;Temperature measurement;Control systems;Monitoring;Storage tanks;Feeds;Hardware","environmental science computing;Internet;Internet of Things;maintenance engineering;microcontrollers;public domain software;sanitary engineering;telecontrol;wastewater treatment","open-source IoT framework;human welfare;mobile waste water treatment solution;sub-Arctic regions;centralized sewer system;software platforms;semiindustrial water treatment system;Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf;remote control;electrical loads;remote troubleshooting;mobile household water reuse system;Alaska water;internet enabled Arduino Mega;internet of things;on-site control;proactive maintenance scheduling","","","","13","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the world population is expected to be 9.2 billion by 2050, and consequently the food demand will be increased by 70%. To cope with these increasing demands, the food production also needs to increase by at least 50–70 % to its current capacity by 2050. Improving production efficiency on farms and minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an ongoing and active research area. The article is a work-in-progress presentation of our ongoing efforts in the direction of building an all-encompassing framework towards less GHG intensive climate-neutral farming practices. The dairy sector within agriculture is being used for validation and experimentation, with cows as the centrepiece, and the farmers as the stakeholders that will be the ultimate actors for sustainable environmental impact from the improved farming practices in place. The work also focuses on measuring the behavioural changes of farmer(s) for adoption of technology. The envisioned end goal is to build an overarching toolkit and framework for effective knowledge sharing. The article starts with a brief contextual introduction, followed by key considerations, challenges and identified research questions that need to be addressed and evaluated at a wider level in the research community to build the desired framework at a global scale.","2377-6919","978-1-6654-3372-3","10.1109/GHTC53159.2021.9612417","SFI; DAFM; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612417","data-driven;smart dairy;smart farming;climate neutral;farming practices;framework;smart agriculture","Greenhouse effect;Sociology;Buildings;Climate change;Organizations;Agriculture;Stakeholders","agriculture;air pollution control;dairying;food processing industry;food products;knowledge management;sustainable development","improving production efficiency;work-in-progress presentation;GHG intensive climate-neutral farming practices;dairy sector;food production;food and agriculture organization;greenhouse gas;sustainable environmental impact","","","","15","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present project is an automatic composing program trained on a corpus of songs from musical theater to create novel material, directly generating a scored lead sheet of vocal melody and chords. The program can also produce output based upon phonetic analysis of user-provided lyrics. The chance to undertake the research arose from a television documentary funded by Sky Arts that considered the question of whether current-generation, computationally creative methods could devise a new work of musical theater (the research described here provides but one strand within that project). Allied with the documentary, the resultant musical had a two-week West End run in London and was itself broadcast in full. Evaluation of the project included both design feedback from a musical theater composer team, and critical feedback from audiences and media coverage. The research challenges of the real-world context are discussed, with respect to the compromises necessary to get such a project to the stage.","0148-9267","","10.1162/COMJ_a_00373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782489","","","","","","","","","","13 Dec 2016","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

A transformation in the notion of virtual space is observed: from its conception as an autonomous reality to the merged reality of physical-digital. The conception of virtual space as cyberspace is crucial as it augmented the experience of physical space offering a new potential. A new syntax of space emerges from digital space. Focussing on specific studies of form generating mechanisms in digital space, it is presented that they have strong relations with Chomsky's theory of generative grammar and with Hillier's approach for the genotypic form of space. In the context of an augmented syntax of digital space through generative processes, it is shown that the notion of virtual is the filter between the field of possibility of the digital and the actuality of physical space","0537-9989","978-0-86341-663-7","10.1049/cp:20060627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197757","","","augmented reality;grammars","virtual space;autonomous reality;digital space;grammar;augmented syntax","","","","","","15 May 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Dependent agents use effective information connections for coordinating and adjusting resource distribution, thereby reaching agreements between dependent agents. However, during the process of coordination, an effective method of assessment is necessary for information linkage. This research proposes an effective method for assessing the design of the coordination of autonomous agents, which can be applied to urban outdoor space design based on the developed ""good place"" model base. The purpose of this research is to assess the coordination effectiveness of coordination agents during the interaction process of the design model via numerical analysis. This project adopts autonomous coordination agents to simulate the design goal, constructs a coordination model, and defines the coordination collections of agent groups, and regards the conflicts in the coordination process as the coordination problems of agents in each group.","","978-1-4673-0767-3","10.1109/IS3C.2012.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228263","coordinating agents module;open-air space;assessment modules","Cities and towns;Organizations;Indexes;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Numerical models;Atmosphere","multi-agent systems;pattern recognition","preliminary study;assessment model;open air space design pattern;coordinating agents;finite resources;individual benefits;group goals;information connections;adjusting resource distribution;information linkage;autonomous agents;outdoor space design;numerical analysis;autonomous coordination agents","","","","24","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, maintaining these systems' accuracy and security remains a significant obstacle. A face-and-email OTP-based voting system based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methodology is proposed in this study to address these issues. Facial recognition and email OTP verification are used to verify a voter's identity and capture their face for the system. A CNN model that has been trained on a database of faces belonging to registered voters is used to perform the facial recognition process. After their identification has been confirmed, the voter may utilize the technology to cast their ballot. An additional layer of security and protection against potential fraud or hacking is provided by the combination of email OTP verification and facial recognition. In addition, the privacy and accuracy of the voting process are guaranteed by making use of a secure database and a user-friendly interface. The legal and ethical ramifications of incorporating facial recognition technology into a voting system, including privacy concerns and the possibility of algorithmic bias, must be taken into account during system design and implementation. A face-and-email OTP-based voting system based on CNN methodology provides an effective and secure option for online voting while preserving voter privacy and accuracy.","","979-8-3503-2142-5","10.1109/ICIRCA57980.2023.10220680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220680","Component;Formatting;Convolutional Neural Network;Facial recognition;Voters","Privacy;Ethics;Electronic voting systems;Databases;Face recognition;Fraud;Convolutional neural networks","authorisation;blockchains;convolutional neural nets;data privacy;face recognition;fraud;government data processing","appropriate authentication;CNN methodology;CNN model;Convolutional Neural Network methodology;effective option;facial recognition process;facial recognition technology;online voting systems;registered voters;secure database;secure option;secured electronic voting system;security;significant obstacle;system design;voter privacy;voting process","","","","16","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To model an environment, both the modeler and the users of the model are required: (i) to use a formal language for describing and explaining the functions and behaviors of a phenomenon and its environment, and (ii) to use the power of information technologies to search and experiment with new environments that would best address the problem at hand.

The existing multi-chip interconnection technologies, such as CCIX, CXL and NVLink, are faced with the problems of not open protocol, high hardware overhead and difficulty to reuse with existing high-speed peripherals. Considering the limitation of current multi-chip interconnection, we adopt the network centered idea to design FT_Link open architecture, which realizes the interconnection of multiple chips in a low-cost way and enables requests to access other chip spaces transparently. FT_Link system is built on common logic layer and physical layer of the existing high-speed peripherals, making it flexible and versatile.

"GeoBMS: Hybrid Cloud/ On-Premise Architecture for Building Energy Optimization","K. Krishnamurthy; P. Singh; N. Sriraman","President, Candela IoT, Mountain View, USA; Advisor, Candela IoT; Advisor, Candela IoT","2019 Global IoT Summit (GIoTS)","22 Jul 2019","2019","","","1","6","Building energy optimization offers an impactful and readily addressable opportunity for reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings. Owners/operators of commercial properties (building operators) have recognized this opportunity and invested significantly in both energy management devices (such as sensors and controllers) and systems (such as Building Management Systems, BMS) to be master-controllers for these installed devices. Recent studies have revealed that an additional 10% energy savings opportunity would become available if building operators can sustain optimal BMS configurations. Unfortunately, at least three significant challenges limit ongoing BMS configuration optimization. First, most BMSs have vendor-specific interfaces that require custom, one-off integrations for remote access. Second, a lack of consistency in how building configurations and performance data is represented from one BMS to another, makes it hard to aggregate performance trends. Third, BMSs often support single users, i.e., building operators, impeding the ability to support for multi-stakeholder applications such as for personalizing occupant experiences and planning disaster evacuations. We propose a hybrid cloud/on-premise model that reuses existing BMS implementations but incorporates the benefits of new cloud technologies. Our model employs a cloud-based “middle layer” infrastructure (which we call GeoBMS) that connects on-premise BMSs to scalable building management applications. The hybrid model addresses each of the identified BMS limitations: remote inaccessibility through virtualization; inconsistent data representation through unified cloud data models; and lack of multi-stakeholder access through global authentication. GeoBMS offers published APIs for applications to access virtualized infrastructure capabilities. We present a proof-of-concept application (which we call EnergyOptimize) that uses GeoBMS to monitor energy performance and optimize building configurations. We illustrate the application using a museum case-example.","","978-1-7281-2171-0","10.1109/GIOTS.2019.8766402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8766402","Energy Management;Building Configuration Optimization;Hybrid Cloud;Sustainability;Smart Buildings","Buildings;Cloud computing;Optimization;Energy consumption;Sensors;Stakeholders;Virtualization","application program interfaces;building management systems;cloud computing;data models;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;optimisation;software architecture;virtualisation","GeoBMS;energy consumption;building operators;energy management devices;cloud-based middle layer infrastructure;unified cloud data models;building energy optimization;building management systems;hybrid cloud-on-premise architecture;BMS configuration optimization;vendor-specific interfaces;APIs;virtualization;energy savings","","","","10","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nature of this research area requires to bridge the many disciplines needed to develop human-centered, assistive computing systems. Such bridging may seem unattainable considering the conceptual and practical gaps between the related disciplines and the challenges of propagating human-related concerns throughout the many stages of the development process of assistive technologies. As a consequence, existing assistive technologies lack a proper needs analysis; their development is often driven by technology concerns, resulting in ill-designed and stereotype-biased systems; and, most of them are not tested for their effectiveness in assisting users. In this paper, we propose a systematic exploration of this vast challenge. First, we define Assistive Computing as a research area and propose key principles to drive its study. Then, we introduce a tool-based methodology dedicated to developing assistive computing support, integrating a range of disciplines from human-related sciences to computer science. This methodology is purposefully pragmatic in that it leverages, aggregates and revisits numerous research results, concretizing it with a range of examples. More generally, our goal is i) to provide a framework to conduct research in the area of Assistive Computing and ii) to identify the necessary bridges between disciplines to account for all the dimensions of such systems.","","978-1-4503-5661-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445155","Interdisciplinary research;Assistive computing support;Cognitive impairment;User centered software development","Software engineering","assisted living;cognition;data analysis;human computer interaction;human factors","assistive technologies;stereotype-biased systems;assisting users;assistive computing support;human-related sciences;computer science;cognitively impaired individuals;developing computing systems;assistive computing systems;related disciplines;human-related concerns","","","","42","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, increased research has focused on serious games utilizing Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) technologies, such as large-scale projection-based systems and head-mounted displays. The high level of immersion provided by IVR has been found to benefit learning outcomes, as it reduces environmental distractions and helps individuals focus on learning tasks while also addressing social anxiety. Researchers have conducted significant work in this field over the past decade, yielding promising results. However, the development of these learning interventions comes with methodological challenges and issues, especially in how to conduct the development process and design IVR-based serious games for the learning of people with autism. Based on these premises, this systematic review thoroughly analyzes the literature on developing IVR-based serious games for individuals with autism, discussing inherent shortcomings and reflecting on them. Then, twenty IVR-based serious games for people with autism developed between 2009 and mid-2021 are selected and analyzed, focusing on the people engaged in the development process, the design methodology adopted, and the serious game design framework employed. From this analysis, a set of recommendations are proposed to support anyone interested in developing IVR-based serious games for people with autism.

Literature review: I reviewed the literature related to the convergence and divergence of corporate behaviors under the framework of the institutional theory. Comparative studies on web-based CSR communication (CSRC) were also addressed, and CSR development in China and Korea was described as the research context to develop hypotheses and research questions. Research questions: 1. How do Chinese and Korean CSRCs resemble each other in international social media? 2. What are the differences between Chinese and Korean CSRCs in international social media? Research methodology: I selected six Chinese companies and six Korean firms from the 2019 Forbes 2000 world's-largest-corporations ranking, and analyzed the content of their English-language Facebook accounts using “Leximancer,” a powerful textual analysis software package. Results: Results indicated that the CSR messages of Chinese and Korean firms resembled each other at a macrolevel but differed at a microlevel. In addition, the CSR messages of Chinese companies were more likely to reflect national strategic agendas, while Korean firms placed greater emphasis on short-term events and legal compliance. Conclusions: Chinese and Korean corporations have adopted an approach of “global topics, native framing” in their CSRCs to achieve a balance between internal and external legitimacy.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2021.3064409","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19BXW102); Chinese Companies on International Social Media; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9415411","Comparative analysis;corporate social responsibility;crossvergence;Facebook;Leximancer","Companies;Business;Government;Stakeholders;Cultural aspects;Social networking (online);Law;Social implications of technology;Social factors;Global communication","corporate social responsibility;globalisation;law;organisational aspects","legal compliance;english-language facebook accounts;Chinese CSRC development;Korean CSRCs;web-based CSR communication;international social media;multinational corporations;Korean firms;corporate social responsibility","","","","82","IEEE","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Managers must work to meet the fishery's goals while adapting their commercial and subsistence eco-service management practices to meet changing ecological conditions. Pre- and in-season fishery management practices are supported by historical and location-based management knowledge. Unexpected changes to environmental conditions may be outside the adaptive capacity of the management. Furthermore, managers currently lack a tool to test how proposed policy will alter fishery outcomes. We present an agent-based simulation framework designed for the Kenai case-study that incorporates stakeholder harvest and effort data, as well as Oncorhynchus nerka and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmon run-timing dynamics for the last 35 years. The resulting high-fidelity and verified model was used for scenario-based studies to understand how shifting ecological and social drivers effect the seasonal outcomes of fishery dynamics. Scenarios were determined from plausible future changes to system drivers identified during participatory stakeholder meetings and in scientific literature from southeast Alaska. Using our model, we uncovered recent instability in the Kenai fisheries coupled socio-ecological system dynamics, and determined equations that describe the strategy of fishery managers in responding to in-season drivers. Sensitivity of seasonal fishery outcomes to different drivers was quantified via the scenario-based studies. Our results show our agent-based simulation framework to be a capable decision support tool, one that resource managers might use for testing outcomes of proposed policy change in response to environmental change.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232373","","Data models;Biological system modeling;Stakeholders;Rivers;Correlation;Electronic mail;Timing","aquaculture;decision support systems;ecology;government policies;knowledge management;social sciences;sustainable development","government policy;Alaska Kenai fisheries;fishery management practices;location-based management knowledge;historical-based management knowledge;decision support tool;eco-service management practices;Oncorhynchus nerka;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmon;resource managers;seasonal fishery outcomes;socio-ecological system dynamics;fishery dynamics;stakeholder harvest;Kenai case-study;long term sustainability;agent-based model;environmental conditions","","","","18","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards Informing Human-Centric ICT Standardization for Data-Driven Societies","M. Thinyane","United Nations University, Institute on Computing and Society (UNU-CS), Macau–SAR","Journal of ICT Standardization","22 Sep 2023","2018","6","3","179","202","Information and communication technology (ICT) standards play a crucial role towards harnessing technological developments and shaping the technology landscape. ICT standards development is largely driven by standards developing organizations or standards setting organizations that represent and are informed by the perspectives and interests of the ICT private sector and the public sector. Thus the shaping of the standards is mostly driven by the business, technical, and legal impetus, towards facilitating greater market influence, coordination, integration, interoperability, and legal conformity. The technocentric, business-focused perspective to ICT developments, and corollary to ICT standards development, is distinct from and can be orthogonal to the human-centric perspective that elevates the role and centrality of the human concerns over the technology and business concerns. Notwithstanding the crucial role of business and technology, it remains that at the centre of the 21st century data-driven societies are individuals and end-users who are the primary actants and agents within the technology and data ecosystems. This gives motivation for infusing the human perspectives and values into technology development as well as into ICT standards development. This is more pronounced for cases where the business and technocentric interests are at odds and opposed to the human interests, such as, the need for increased datafication to support Big Data developments versus the need for individuals' privacy preservation. In this research, which is framed through a case study of personal health informatics in the context of sustainable development (i.e., sustainable development goal on “health and wellbeing” – SDG3) indicators monitoring, we have undertaken a survey to investigate the human-centric values and attitudes associated with the collection and use of personal data. From this inquiry, the paper highlights and surfaces: individuals attitudes and perceptions around monitoring of social indicators; key considerations associated with data ownership, privacy and confidentiality of data, as well as sharing of personal data within the data ecosystem. The paper then discusses how these findings could inform and be infused into the development of technology artefacts and standards, towards a realization of more human-centric data-informed societies.","2246-0853","","10.13052/jicts2245-800X.631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10258066","Data-driven societies;standardization;human-centric ICT","Surveys;Data privacy;Law;Statistical analysis;Ecosystems;Standards organizations;Information and communication technology","","","","","","36","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

Although many studies on semantic extraction have been carried out, few have focused on how to precisely and effectively extract semantics from multiple heterogeneous data schemas. This paper presents a semi-automatic semantic extraction method based on a neutral representation format (NRF) for acquiring semantics from heterogeneous data schemas. As a unified syntax-independent model, NRF removes all the contingencies of heterogeneous data schemas from the original data environment. Conceptual extraction and keyword extraction are used to acquire the semantics from the NRF. Conceptual extraction entails constructing a conceptual model, while keyword extraction seeks to obtain the metadata. An industrial case is given to validate the approach. This method has good extensibility and flexibility. The results show that the method provides simple, accurate, and effective semantic interoperability in multi-enterprise business collaboration environments.","1007-0214","","10.1016/S1007-0214(09)70030-6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6074893","semantic interoperability;semantic extraction;neutral representation format;business collaboration","Semantics;OWL;Ontologies;Collaboration;Data mining;Business;Data models","","","","","","","","17 Jan 2012","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, while the demand for RaaS utilization within the industry is high, it has not successfully acquired many users. One of the reasons is that the accuracy of the robot's recognition-judgment-action process does not reach a level that users can trust, and the other reason is that it is challenging to learn how to control the robot. Therefore, this study focused on services that allow users to control robots easily within industrial sites. Speech recognition was implemented using RESTful API and Server-Client communication, and a mobile manipulator robot, what we call Little-Helper (LH), is used for implementation. According to the human operators, communicate with the robot by voice speech, increasing collaboration efficiency and productivity of the industry is expected.","2374-314X","978-1-6654-0014-5","10.1109/KST53302.2022.9729068","MOTIE(grant numbers:P0008749); Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9729068","RaaS (Robot-as-a-Service);Mobile Manipulator;Speech Recognition;Cloud Computing;Smart Factory","Industries;Productivity;Cloud computing;Service robots;Collaboration;Restful API;Speech recognition","application program interfaces;client-server systems;cloud computing;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;industrial manipulators;mobile robots;service robots;service-oriented architecture;speech recognition","industrial sites;human operator;service-oriented architectures;cloud computing;RaaS utilization;robot-as-a-service;speech recognition;mobile manipulator robot;human-robot collaboration;RESTful API;server-client communication;Little-Helper","","","","15","IEEE","11 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, limited studies are available about the elicitation of impact-related information from stakeholders, and strategies are particularly needed to elicit possible longterm effects, including negative ones, that go beyond the planned system goals. This paper reports a case study about the impact of digitalisation in remote mountain areas, in the context of a system for ordinary land management and hydro-geological risk control. The elicitation process was based on interviews and workshops. In the initial phase, past and present impacts were identified. In a second phase, future impacts were forecasted through the discussion of two alternative scenarios: a dystopic, technology-intensive one, and a technology-balanced one. The approach was particularly effective in identifying negative impacts. Among them, we highlight the higher stress due to the excess of connectivity, the partial reduction of decision-making abilities, and the risk of marginalisation for certain types of stakeholders. The study posits that before the elicitation of system goals, requirements engineers need to identify the socio-economic impacts of ICT technologies included in the system, as negative effects need to be properly mitigated. Our study contributes to the literature with: a set of impacts specific to the case, which can apply to similar contexts; an effective approach for impact elicitation; and a list of lessons learned from the experience.","2332-6441","979-8-3503-2689-5","10.1109/RE57278.2023.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260785","requirements engineering;requirements elicitation;rural areas;case study","Conferences;Rural areas;Decision making;Instant messaging;Mobile handsets;Stakeholders;Requirements engineering","decision making;socio-economic effects;sustainable development","alternative scenarios;decision-making abilities;designing systems;digital technology interventions;digitalisation;double-edged impact;elicitation process;future impacts;hydro-geological risk control;ICT technologies;impact elicitation;impact-related information;negative ones;ordinary land management;planned system goals;possible longterm effects;present impacts;remote mountain areas;rural areas;similar contexts;socio-economic impacts;socio-technical context;stakeholders;sustainability concerns demands;technology-balanced one;technology-intensive;workshops","","","","58","IEEE","28 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few empirical studies have been performed on the required actions of the care technology developers for technology integration. Therefore, we conducted a multiple case study of the care technology developers to clarify the required actions for promoting care technology integration in the care service systems. Through semistructured interviews of six business cases in Japan and a qualitative thematic analysis of the individual ones, we obtained nine required actions for care technology integration that were categorized according to their major stakeholders and business phases. In addition, we carried out a cross-case analysis from the aspects of business types, firm sizes, and product types to examine the differences in the required actions.

Utilizing formal ideation and innovation methods from the 4D Design Innovation (DI) process, the teams studied what specific problems to solve, explored potential solution ideas, and developed some early-concept prototypes for feasibility demonstration. Design Innovation (DI) provides both an overall process for product design and also methods for each step in the process. This paper details the correlation between the steps in the DI process and the results produced by the teams. The teams primarily focused on minimizing the risk of disease transmission through reducing the physical touching of common public items; additional solutions relating to contact tracing and social distancing were also explored. Initial functional prototypes were developed and demonstrated for: (a) touchless elevator control systems using voice commands, foot pedals, gestures, and touchless buttons; (b) an automated desk usage hygienic management system; (c) an automated remote video person tracker for monitoring compliance with indoor social distancing and room capacity limits; and (d) a contact tracing app. We discuss the prototyped solutions in detail, and describe promising ways forward for developing these technologies, with the aims of combatting the spread of disease and ensuring overall public health, safety, and security.","","978-1-6654-4152-0","10.1109/HST53381.2021.9619827","Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619827","touchless interaction;no contact technology;no touch devices;contact tracing;proximity tracing;hygiene;safety;health;contact transmission mitigation;fomite transmission;design innovation;design thinking","Technological innovation;Pandemics;Prototypes;Human factors;Social factors;Product design;Security","computer based training;diseases;human computer interaction;innovation management;medical computing;occupational safety;product design;project management","design innovation projects;student teams;US Air Force Research Lab;COVID-19 pandemic;disease transmission;public spaces;formal ideation;explored potential solution ideas;early-concept prototypes;feasibility demonstration;product design;DI process;common public items;tracing distancing;functional prototypes;touchless elevator control systems;automated desk usage hygienic management system;indoor social distancing;room capacity limits;public health;4D design innovation process;automated remote video person tracker","","","","16","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to novel forms of interaction, MSEs also offer novel forms of “learner traces” through multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). This article presents the results of a systematic literature review on how multisensory interactions and the respective analytics can support the use and design of SLEs. The findings from the analysis of 33 papers synthesize and clarify the latest advancements in the intersection of interactions and analytics in MSEs, discuss how those advancements can support SLEs' affordances and uses, and pave the way for improving our understanding of how various interaction modalities can support learning and under what conditions.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3243210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040904","Literature review;multimodal learning analytics (MMLA);multisensory interaction;smart learning environments (SLEs)","Systematics;Educational technology;Databases;Task analysis;Bibliographies;Visualization;Taxonomy","computer aided instruction","enhance smart learning environments;information exchange;intelligent capabilities;interaction modalities;interconnectivity capabilities;learning systems;MSE;multimodal learning analytics;multisensory environments;multisensory interactions;respective analytics;SLE affordances;systematic literature review","","","","111","CCBY","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Apart from queues reduced in banking halls, bank clients can still access services outside the regular operational hours. However, a rise in ATM fraud cases has led to banks improving ATM security by adding security ATM keypad covers, surveillance cameras, and even ATM security booths, measures that were not there at ATMs' inception. The academia is also replete with literature on various ATM designs to enhance the security of the facility and the user. However, proposed solutions rarely build on existing infrastructure and technologies, making them difficult to implement as they require additional equipment. For IoT-based solutions, testing is relegated to the communication of components without evaluating the practicability of the proposed solution. In an effort to correct these challenges and secure an ATM user, this paper introduces a conceptual design of a secure cardless ATM system that leverages existing technologies and infrastructure with little additional costs for implementation. A workshop was then used to identify improvements for future implementation. Recommendations from stakeholders and lessons learned from the workshop are discussed.","","979-8-3503-1487-8","10.1109/ETNCC59188.2023.10284943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284943","ATM security;authentication;mobile","Costs;Automated teller machine;Conferences;Surveillance;Market research;Cameras;Fraud","","","","","","36","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research paper presents an innovative approach that considers ecological, socioeconomic, and technological factors. The proposed approach integrates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that take into account the preferences and opinions of stakeholders. To analyze the various criteria involved, cubic picture fuzzy numbers (CPFNs) are utilized. To ensure fairness in evaluating CPFNs, the study focuses on developing operational laws and aggregation operators that promote neutrality and fairness. Specifically, the paper introduces the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly weighted average (CPFFWA) operator” and the “cubic picture fuzzy fairly ordered weighted averaging (CPFFOWA) operator.” By considering stakeholders and prioritizing their long-term sustainability and resilience, this approach proves to be highly valuable for policymakers, forest managers, and other relevant parties.

Furthermore, the need for visual texture to support markerless AR is often at odds with human aesthetic preferences, and understanding how to balance these competing requirements is challenging due to the siloed nature of the relevant research areas. To address this, we present an integrated design methodology for AR spaces, that incorporates both tracking and human factors into the design process. On the tracking side, we develop the first VI-SLAM evaluation technique that combines the flexibility and control of virtual environments with real inertial data. We use it to perform systematic, quantitative experiments on the effect of visual texture on pose estimation accuracy; through 2000 trials in 20 environments, we reveal the impact of both texture complexity and edge strength. On the human side, we show how virtual reality (VR) can be used to evaluate user satisfaction with environments, and highlight how this can be tailored to AR research and use cases. Finally, we demonstrate our integrated design methodology with a case study on AR museum design, in which we conduct both VI-SLAM evaluations and a VR-based user study of four different museum environments.","1554-7868","978-1-6654-5325-7","10.1109/ISMAR55827.2022.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995481","Human-centered computing;Human computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms;Mixed / augmented reality","Visualization;Systematics;Pose estimation;Virtual environments;Human factors;Integrated design;Museums","augmented reality;human factors;museums;pose estimation;SLAM (robots);virtual reality","AR museum design;AR spaces;augmented reality spaces;competing requirements;design process;different museum environments;edge strength;human aesthetic preferences;human factors;inexact guidelines;integrated design methodology;markerless augmented reality experiences;qualitative guidelines;quantitative experiments;relevant research areas;siloed nature;systematic experiments;texture complexity;tracking;VI-SLAM evaluation technique;VI-SLAM evaluations;virtual environments;virtual reality;visual environment;visual texture","","","","77","IEEE","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, as a key internal stakeholder, the top manager’s decisions including budget, personnel et al. could be vital for a R&D project team. The different interests among different internal and external stakeholders’ make the problem more complex. In this paper, we utilize the neural network algorithm to simulate the decisions from the top manager. With the data from non-industrial robotic R&D project teams in Japan, a neural network model of the top manager is constructed.

Intrusion detection systems help in detecting these attacks, but the large amount of false positives has decreased their usability. Different methods have been proposed to reduce the amount of these false positives, which consist of different classification methods. Aggregation of similar alerts is a method proposed to reduce false positives and the large number of alerts, but the problem is assigning similar alerts the same classification parameters. Rules have been created which correlate alerts based on three parameters, but the alerts should be labeled with these parameters. Labeling these alerts, is a time consuming task, because deep knowledge on each alert is required to correctly identify the parameters. This time consuming job has been done on 13000 Emerging Threats Snort signatures, and has been used as a knowledge base to label other alerts. In this paper a method has been proposed to label similar signatures automatically. This method uses word extraction from signatures to identify the words which can specify these labels automatically. To test the method around 1000 signatures, which have been classified manually, were classified by this method and the precision and recall has been computed. The results show that a large number of signatures can be classified using this method.","","978-1-4799-5383-7","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994035","Classification;Correlation;Alert labeling","Correlation;Trojan horses;Intrusion detection;Data mining;Grippers;Knowledge based systems;Servers","computer network security;digital signatures;pattern classification","automatic IDS alert classification method;correlation systems;computer network usage;sensitive data storage;sensitive data transfer;intrusion detection systems;attack detection;alert aggregation;false-positive reduction;alert assignment;classification parameters;alert correlation;alert labelling;Emerging Threats Snort signatures;knowledge base;automatic signature labelling;word extraction;precision value;recall value;signature classification","","","","15","IEEE","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This global experience has (re)shaped political and public demands on science and technology and the ways in which we incorporate scientific findings in our everyday lives. Through a brief review of models developed for COVID-19, this paper discusses the urgent need to move towards ‘responsible modeling’ in which social, ethical, and cultural issues claim the same importance as technical aspects. This includes a new social contract between modeler and society on one hand, and science and policy on the other hand. The characteristics of modeling work under this new paradigm, however, are still not well understood and are a topic of debate. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new research agenda that can facilitate the discussion about ‘responsible modeling’ and the overarching principles that underpin the concept’s aims and objectives.","2637-6415","","10.1109/TTS.2022.3218738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9934084","Responsible modeling;ethics;public policy;COVID-19","COVID-19;Pandemics;Mathematical models;Public policy;Predictive models;Ethics;Modeling","cultural aspects;epidemics;ethical aspects;government;politics;socio-economic effects","computational modeling;COVID-19 pandemic;cultural issues;ethical issues;global experience;public demands;responsible modeling;scientific findings;social contract;social issues","","","","117","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we demonstrate how a previously proposed theoretical risk assessment framework that focuses on making risk assessment more scientific can be implemented and applied to cloud networks. Our work offers a practical risk assessment implementation for cloud networks where disparate network owners can directly measure network risks in an objective, uniform and repeatable manner across networks by allowing the network owners to collaboratively agree on risk metrics and continuously monitor their cloud networks with the same tool, which employs these agreed upon metrics. The end result is a science-based risk metric (SBRM) based on the global impact of the vulnerabilities in the network. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this SBRM by: (1) imposing real vulnerabilities on realistic cloud networks built from real hardware (multi-core 3 Ghz Xeon Deterlab servers), (2) demonstrating the operational use of our risk assessment implementation to measure risk across several emulated cloud networks, and (3) describing our approach.","","978-1-6654-4067-7","10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422521","National Intelligence University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9422521","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Measurement;Cloud computing;Mechatronics;Conferences;Collaboration;Tools;Hardware","cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;risk management","network risks;cloud networks;collaborative global impact cloud computing risk assessment;science based risk metric","","","","15","IEEE","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, visual cues of the image modality or experimental methods can help expert curators identify relevant papers from an increasing number of publications. Automating the identification of these content-bearing images can thus be helpful in computer-assisted curation. However, the paucity of labeled datasets and the specialized training required to label such images hinder the development of such tools. To address this problem, we present the design of ANIMO, a labeling system that integrates extraction and segmentation tools to ease the annotation burden. We first introduce two taxonomies of image modalities and experimental methods, derived in collaboration with curators. On the back-end of the system, we process batches of documents and create a labeling task per document. At the front-end, expert curators can access these tasks through a web interface and access the article of interest. We describe the evaluation of this system by a group of biocurators, and the human factor lessons learned from this interdisciplinary experience.","","978-1-6654-0126-5","10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669898","Health; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669898","","Training;Visualization;Image segmentation;Annotations;Conferences;Taxonomy;Human factors","human factors;image segmentation;medical computing;medical image processing;user interfaces","ANIMO;biomed image;biomedical articles;curation workflow;visual cues;image modality;expert curators;content-bearing images;computer-assisted curation;labeled datasets;specialized training;segmentation tools;labeling task","","","","40","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the application of automated support is still limited in practice. In this study, we examine automated RE support in agile development through a qualitative analysis using industry experts. We have found that the application of automated RE support tools is primarily in the experimental stage, largely due to the limited practical implementation in industry settings. The current focus has been on research experiments, with relatively fewer instances of real-world industry application. Although experts are optimistic about its huge potential to reduce development efforts and costs if automation is harnessed.

However, AAC devices do not support nonverbal communication, which allows people to take turns, regulate conversation dynamics, and express intentions. Nonverbal communication requires motion, which is often challenging for AAC users to produce due to motor constraints. In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as “sidekicks,” might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers’ goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing. We show how these parameters manifest in appearance and behavior and how they can guide future designs for augmented nonverbal communication.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-8289-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045296","communication;nonverbal behavior;socially assistive robots","Conferences;Dynamics;Human-robot interaction;Prototypes;Oral communication;Assistive robots;Behavioral sciences","handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;interactive systems","AAC devices;AAC users;accessible co-design workshop;assistive sidekicks;augmented communicators;augmented nonverbal communication;co-designed prototypes;conversation dynamics;conversational goals;conversational support;different sidekick motions;express intentions;future designs;motion experts;motion-based;possible sidekick forms;socially assistive robots;speakers;speech-based communication;support ACs","","","","59","","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this article is to identify consistencies between two models that appear to have overlapping tasks: Goal-Function Trees (GFTs) and value models. Both models are perceived to represent information about the system and stakeholder preferences, but have historically used differing processes and language. An analysis of the functional use and terminology for the two models reveals consistencies. The two models are compared in this article using content analysis of systems engineering academic literature. It is seen that physics-based system representation and stakeholder preference incorporation are often common to both models. A coffee maker is used to illustrate the potential consistencies and overlapping tasks between the models. Extending this simple example, the applicability of the models to space systems is discussed. The findings of this article can be used by systems engineers to improve their efficiency when applying both GFTs and value models.","2771-9987","","10.1109/OJSE.2023.3265900","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:NNM11AA01A 14.1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098162","Goal-function tree (GFT);systems engineering;systems engineering models;value modeling","Modeling;Analytical models;Mathematical models;Stakeholders;Systems engineering and theory;Task analysis;Terminology","aerospace computing;systems engineering;trees (mathematics)","complexity challenges;consistencies;functional use;goal-function trees;overlapping tasks;physics-based system representation;space systems;stakeholder preference incorporation;stakeholder preferences;system development;systems engineering academic literature;value models","","","","99","CCBYNCND","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, TCAM’s limited storage capacity has long been a scalability challenge to enforce fine-grained forwarding policies in SDN. Based on the observation of traffic locality, the rule-caching mechanism employs a combination of TCAM and Random Access Memory (RAM) to maintain the forwarding rules of large and small flows, respectively. However, previous works cannot identify large flows timely and accurately, and suffer from high computational complexity when addressing rule dependencies in TCAM. Worse still, TCAM only caches the forwarding rules of large flows but ignores the latency requirements of small flows. Small flows encounter cache-miss in TCAM and then will be diverted to RAM, where they have to experience slow lookup processes. To jointly optimize the performance of both high-throughput large flows and latency-sensitive small flows, we propose a hybrid rule-caching framework, H-Cache, to scale traffic-aware forwarding policies in SDN. H-Cache identifies large flows through a collaboration of learning-based and threshold-based methods to achieve early detection and high accuracy, and proposes a time-efficient greedy heuristic to address rule dependencies. For small flows, H-Cache establishes default paths in TCAM to speed up their lookup processes, and also reduces their TCAM occupancy through label switching and region partitioning. Experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that H-Cache increases TCAM utilization by an average of 11% and reduces the average completion time of small flows by almost 70%.","1530-2075","979-8-3503-3766-2","10.1109/IPDPS54959.2023.00017","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177484","Rule Caching;TCAM;Software Defined Networking","Distributed processing;Scalability;Random access memory;Collaboration;Switches;Hardware;Software defined networking","cache storage;computer network security;content-addressable storage;software defined networking;table lookup;telecommunication traffic","addressing rule dependencies;cache-miss;computational complexity;fine-grained forwarding policies;H-Cache;label switching;learning-based methods;lookup processes;RAM;random access memory;region partitioning;SDN-enabled switches;software-defined networks;TCAM occupancy;ternary content addressable memory;threshold-based methods;traffic locality;traffic-aware forwarding policies;traffic-aware hybrid rule-caching","","","","26","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the realization of this potential has been problematic and over recent years there have been a number of initiatives supported by government, non government and foreign agencies which have endeavored to aid and encourage the up take of ICT to enable access to such promised benefits. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that ICT has much to offer to SOEs, the study would seem to suggest that use of ICT by SOEs listed under Privatization Commission is still in its infancy. It also identifies some significant barriers which are impacting upon the level of ICT adoption amongst SOEs, and confidence on ICT of the SOEs in Bangladesh.

ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers.

More natural filtering options, such as project membership lists or content-based filtering, are very time consuming to set up and maintain. Especially in research ecosystems, significant fluctuation in team members, organisations and projects themselves is common. Research projects are also usually managed in an ad-hoc manner, making static filtering rules a sub-optimal solution. In this paper we therefore introduce the Mind Mesh paradigm, a novel human-friendly information management approach. Based on a self-describing graph structure, organisational structures, projects, and collaborations are modelled. Leveraging this information, the system can automate and support administrative processes such as email filtering, based on an understanding of the project structures.

While translating requirements into scenarios, details and over-specifications (called Ahab's Legs) need to be added to make requirements concrete and understandable to stakeholders. Despite the expected benefits that they should convey, Ahab's Legs could disturb the requirement validation session. They can, in fact, distract the attention of stakeholders. Valuable discussion time may be wasted when focusing on irrelevant details rather than on the actually relevant ones. In the present paper, we address the Ahab's Leg dilemma and its potential impact on requirement validation sessions. We discuss how to measure the distraction due to Ahab's Legs and what are the possible approaches an analyst can adopt to limit it. Moreover, we present the design of a controlled experiment devoted to measure the impact of Ahab's Legs on requirement validation sessions. In particular, the experiment is meant to (1) estimate the magnitude of the distracting effect, and to (2) assess one of the most promising way to alleviate their negative effect, i.e. by making stakeholder aware of the Ahab's Legs before the validation session.","2329-6356","978-1-4577-1076-6","10.1109/EmpiRE.2011.6046258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046258","","Legged locomotion;Concrete;Context;Software;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Mobile handsets","systems analysis","Ahab's leg dilemma;controlled experiment design;requirement validation session","","","","10","IEEE","17 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.","2153-1641","978-1-63190-045-7","10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2015.259151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349374","Mental disorders;occupational therapists;m-heath;wearable technology;mobile;design","Mental disorders;Medical treatment;Biomedical monitoring;Mobile communication;Interviews;Medical diagnostic imaging","medical disorders;mobile communication;mobile computing;neurophysiology;patient treatment;wearable computers","mobile technology;wearable technology;m-health applications;mental health disorder recovery process;m-Health technology;mental disorder treatment;client-oriented goal setting practice;client self-monitoring;client self-assessment;recovery-based therapeutic techniques;therapist-client recovery process;semistructured interview data;occupational therapists;therapist-client interaction;therapist-client communication;therapist-client design opportunities","","","","25","","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hold a series of interviews with environmental scientists involved in developing and deploying computer based environmental models about the approach taken in engineering models, and describe a case study in deploying an environmental model (WRF: Weather Research & Forecasting) on a cloud architecture. From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment.

To enhance the accuracy and preparedness for extreme weather events, this study explores the potential of using expert crowdsourcing in storm forecasting research through the application of stigmergic collaboration. We present the development and implementation of an expert Crowdsourcing for Semantic Annotation of Atmospheric Phenomena (eCSAAP) system, designed to leverage the collective knowledge and experience of meteorological experts. Through a participatory co-creation process, we iteratively developed a web-based annotation tool capable of capturing multi-faceted insights from weather data and generating visualizations for expert crowdsourcing campaigns. In this context, this article investigates the intrinsic coordination among experts engaged in crowdsourcing tasks focused on the semantic annotation of extreme weather events. The study brings insights about the behavior of expert crowds by considering the cognitive biases and highlighting the impact of existing annotations on the quality of data gathered from the crowd and the collective knowledge generated. The insights regarding the crowdsourcing dynamics, particularly stigmergy, offer a promising starting point for utilizing stigmergic collaboration as an effective coordination mechanism for weather experts in crowdsourcing platforms but also in other domains requiring expertise-driven collective intelligence.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3319597","National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, within project(grant numbers:LA/P/0063/2020); FCT(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/148991/2019); European Social Fund under the Scope of North Portugal Regional Operational Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265012","Atmospheric phenomena;cognitive biases;crisis informatics;expert crowdsourcing;extreme meteorological events;semantic annotation;stigmergy;storms;task modularity;weather maps","Meteorology;Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Annotations;Collaboration;Semantics;Weather forecasting;Atmospheric measurements;Cognition","cognition;crowdsourcing;geophysics computing;storms;weather forecasting","atmospheric phenomena system;collective knowledge;Euro-atlantic region;expert crowdsourcing annotation system;expert crowdsourcing campaigns;extreme weather events;global natural catastrophes;meteorological experts;semantic annotation;stigmergic collaboration;storm forecasting research;storm phenomena;task modularity;weather data;weather experts;weather forecasting systems","","","","104","CCBYNCND","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Development of 3D Modeling Parameter Design in Furniture Design","Y. Zhang","Guangdong University of Science and Technology, China","2023 World Conference on Communication & Computing (WCONF)","4 Sep 2023","2023","","","1","6","Today, with the rapid development of science and technology and information technology, virtual reality technology has become increasingly mature and popular, and is increasingly applied to the field of information multimedia display. Based on Web3D technology virtual reality display design, taking furniture display as an example, this paper analyzes the current 3D modeling virtual display, panoramic virtual display and other technologies using literature analysis and case analysis, and carries out application-oriented research based on the characteristics of virtual furniture display. The development of 3D modeling parametric design in furniture design has completely changed the way designers and manufacturers manufacture furniture. By using advanced software, designers can now create accurate and detailed 3D models for their designs, enabling them to visualize and improve their ideas before actual production. A key advantage of 3D modeling is that it allows designers to try different materials, colors, textures and finishes. They can also test various configurations, sizes and proportions until the desired results are achieved. This method saves the time and money of the physical prototype and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the final product. Another advantage is that parametric design allows more accuracy in designing complex geometry, which is difficult to achieve manually. Taking the furniture exhibition hall and the sofa in the model library as examples, this paper verifies the feasibility of the furniture display design based on panoramic technology and three-dimensional modeling technology. This study involves the production, dissemination, sales and other aspects of furniture products, provides a design fulcrum for the development of furniture display under the new economic conditions, and has very important practical significance for the healthy and sustainable development of the furniture industry.","","979-8-3503-1120-4","10.1109/WCONF58270.2023.10235035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235035","3D modeling;Furniture design;Parameter design","Solid modeling;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Biological system modeling;Virtual reality;Production;Software","furniture;furniture industry;solid modelling;sustainable development;virtual reality","3D modeling parameter design;3D modeling parametric design;accurate D models;design fulcrum;detailed 3D models;furniture design;furniture display design;furniture exhibition hall;furniture industry;furniture products;healthy development;information multimedia display;information technology;literature analysis;model library;panoramic technology;panoramic virtual display;sustainable development;three-dimensional modeling technology;virtual furniture display;virtual reality technology;way designers;Web3D technology virtual reality display design","","","","15","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is adopted as the basic methodology for constructing the flight control metaverse. A common flight control infrastructure is proposed as the foundation for mission system development. A flight control metaverse architecture that targets missions throughout the flight control process is built with extensive applications of AI technology. A new flight control work mode and a mission system work mode are designed to bring about systemic innovation in the flight control work mode. The former work mode features a model-based design of flight control schemes, agile and automatic implementation of mission systems, integrated flight control mission implementation, and parallel operation in physical and virtual spaces. The latter work mode comes with intelligent control, flexible deployment, and autonomous operation capabilities. The flight control metaverse presents a new mode of working space for flight control.

Sahabat Vaksin was developed particularly for Indonesia to help mitigate the effects of anti vaccination narratives in the community. This sentiment has recently been aggravated by misinformation spread through social media and the internet. Most recently, vaccine rejections based on religious misconceptions on the permissibility of certain vaccines has been a key factor. This highlights the need to approach the issue through multiple lenses, going beyond the medical and scientific approaches. Sahabat Vaksin counters anti vaccine narratives through three main stakeholders. First, we equip midwives with adaptive counter messages that will help them deliver information to counter anti-vaccination arguments, touching on both health based as well as religious based counter-arguments, second we provide mothers with short, easy to understand information on vaccination, as well as customized, timely messages based on pregnancy stage or child age and perception towards vaccination, and (iii) we engage local religious leaders and actors to develop and spread their narrative in supporting timely vaccination, including equipping them with appropriate medical and technical knowledge to complement their religious knowledge.","2377-6919","978-1-7281-1780-5","10.1109/GHTC46095.2019.9033135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033135","","Vaccines;Portals;Immune system;Stakeholders;Conferences;Pediatrics","electronic messaging;health care;Internet;medical information systems;portals;social aspects of automation;social networking (online);social sciences computing","web platform;mobile platform;Sahabat Vaksin;immunization willingness;vaccine knowledge portal;timely vaccination;counter-arguments;anti-vaccination arguments;adaptive counter messages;vaccine rejections;anti vaccination;Indonesia;anti vaccine narratives;relevant verifiable information","","","","7","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two major efforts, the Portal to the Future Workshop and the Geoscience Digital Library (GDL) project, have established a vision for the library, a governance process to enable community ownership, management, and construction, and have begun development of a testbed collection, discovery system, and user interface. The DLESE Community Plan lays out in detail the need for this facility, a community vision for its goals and priorities, and a strategy for initial construction of the library. From this initial work, two conclusions emerge as paramount in moving forward with the library. First, it is essential that development of the library community and the building of the technological infrastructure for the library go hand in hand. Second, the library will be most effectively built as a highly coordinated, but distributed community effort. In this way, the full range of talents in the community can be leveraged and rapid development of the library is possible. This paper briefly reviews our technical accomplishments to date and outlines their plans for further development. Progress and plans can be charted in the following three areas: 1. Community-centered design and use case development 2. Discovery system, metadata, and collection testbeds 3.

While nonverbal vocalizations that occur amidst typical speech and infant vocalizations have been studied extensively in the literature, there is limited prior work on vocalizations by mv* individuals. Our work is among the first studies of the communicative and affective information expressed in nonverbal vocalizations by mv* children and adults. We collected labeled vocalizations in real-world settings with eight mv* communicators, with communicative and affective labels provided in-the-moment by a close family member.

Software Requirement Engineering (SRE) process is an essential part of the software development life cycle. With the advent of technology, the software has become necessary component of business, especially with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Due to this many challenges faced by IT SMEs in adoption of SRE for successful completion of projects. There have been many factors affecting the progress of SMEs among which few are reported in this SLR. A total of 40 studies are found which are relevant to the research questions and published between 2010 and 2023. The research highlights that SMEs face significant challenges when implementing effective SRE processes due to a lack of resources, experience, and tools. However, the studies propose various solutions to address these challenges, including Agile methodologies, communication enhancement, collaboration among stakeholders, and tools to support SRE processes. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the human elements of SRE, such as team dynamics, training, and motivation, and suggests that SMEs should establish specialized SRE processes that fit their requirements and resources. The article concludes that more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of SRE practices in SMEs and to provide guidelines and frameworks for improving SRE processes in this significant segment of the software industry. Overall, the research provides helpful insights into the current state of SRE practices in SMEs and highlights the potential for enhancing SRE procedures in this sector.","","979-8-3503-2620-8","10.1109/CITA58204.2023.10262498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262498","IT SMEs;Software Requirement Engineering;SLR","Industries;Training;Systematics;Market research;Software;Requirements engineering;Stakeholders","DP industry;formal specification;small-to-medium enterprises;software development management;systems analysis","implementing effective SRE processes;IT SMEs;medium-sized businesses;software development life cycle;software industry;software Requirement Engineering process;Software Requirement Engineering process;specialized SRE processes;SRE practices","","","","42","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A claim is made by many critics that without knowing how an AI may derive a result or come to a given conclusion, it is impossible to trust in its outcomes. This problem is especially concerning when AI-based systems and applications fail to perform their tasks successfully. In this Special Issue Editorial, we focus on two main areas, explainable AI (XAI) and accuracy, and how both dimensions are critical to building trustworthy systems. We review prominent XAI design themes, leading to a reframing of the design and development effort that highlights the significance of the human, thereby demonstrating the importance of human-centered AI (HCAI). The HCAI approach advocates for a range of deliberate design-related decisions, such as those pertaining to multi-stakeholder engagement and the dissolving of disciplinary boundaries. This enables the consideration and integration of deep interdisciplinary knowledge, as evidenced in our example of social cognitive approaches to AI design. This Editorial then presents a discussion on ways forward, underscoring the value of a balanced approach to assessing the opportunities, risks and responsibilities associated with AI design. We conclude by presenting papers in the Special Issue and their contribution, pointing to future research endeavors.","2637-6415","","10.1109/TTS.2023.3257627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10086944","Artificial intelligence;AI;human-centered design;human-centered AI;business;explainability;accuracy;trustworthiness;socio-technical systems;ethics","Special issues and sections;Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Stakeholders;Psychology;Human computer interaction;Sociotechnical systems","artificial intelligence;cognition","accuracy toward trustworthiness;AI design;artificial intelligence;explainability;HCAI approach advocates;human-centered AI;trustworthy systems","","3","","110","IEEE","29 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recognizing someone is in fact a form of human visual information processing [2]. Long before mirrors were available in the ancient world (circa 5th century BCE the Greeks used hand mirrors for grooming [3]), descriptions of one’s face were always determined by another’s gaze or at best one’s own description of their reflection in clean water illuminated by sunlight. Some even gained nicknames through the identification of distinct features on their forehead, nose, eyes, eyebrows, ears, and cheeks, for example, or through some clear markings, such as freckles or a birthmark.

The evolution of this generation is oriented toward providing innovative services and policymaking to guarantee the well-being of citizens. Research on smart cities is maturing and the question of securing the well-being of cities’ inhabitants is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Considering the challenges and opportunities cities/urban spaces generate, today the imperative is to examine how targeted research and cutting-edge innovation can be effectively communicated to all stakeholders. Thus, synergies emerging at the researchinnovation- policymaking nexus can be exploited and city dwellers’ well-being can be enhanced. Pervasive computing, big data analytics, crowdsourcing, and other timely technologies, including user behavior, brand popularity, recommender systems, and social media analytics, bear the promise and potential that viable solutions to key problems and challenges specific to the future generation of smart cities will be found. The objective of this Special Section in IEEE ACCESS is to examine this promise and potential from a variety of complementary interdisciplinary perspectives, including computing/ ICT, political economy, public policy, innovation, and entrepreneurship.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3057809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356437","","","","","","1","","0","CCBY","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2022.106091","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:2021402011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970440","Automated Optical Inspection;Metaverses;Quality Inspection;Transformers","","automatic optical inspection;inspection;manufacturing processes;open systems;production engineering computing;quality control;quality of service;virtual reality","Automated Quality Inspection;bottomup inspection device development;entire manufacturing process;integrated inspection;metaverse tide;metaverses;QoM;QoP;QoS;Quality Transformers","","9","","31","","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While we had separate calls for papers, separate chairs and review processes for each conference, we had a unified, stronger community with a joint program committee. Even though the proceedings separate the papers in distinct chapters for each conference, there is a single conference program designed jointly by the program chairs of the three conferences. More precisely, papers accepted separately by the WICSA 2016, QoSA 2016, and CBSE 2016 conferences will be presented together in shared sessions. Hence, this year’s event is a great opportunity to bring together the researchers from the WICSA, QoSA and CBSE conference series. This year, WICSA, QoSA and CBSE calls for papers have attracted 149 submissions in total. Papers submitted to either WICSA, QoSA or CBSE were evaluated separately for each conference. After a careful evaluation by at least three reviewers and a following discussion period, 30 papers were accepted from WICSA, 12 from QoSA and 14 from CBSE. During the technical sessions, conference attendees will have the opportunity to listen to 56 presentations in 18 shared sessions. Some of these sessions will be working sessions with time slots dedicated to extended open discussions. In their calls for papers WICSA, QoSA, and CBSE addressed key concerns of software architectures across the system life cycle, such as designing for longevity, designing for reliability, and designing for flexibility. When we allocated the accepted papers to presentations sessions, it became evident that these concerns were shared by the three conferences. Hence the sessions were assembled to focus on these concerns.","","978-1-5090-2569-5","10.1109/CBSE.2016.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497421","","","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators.
