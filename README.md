# Systematic-Literature-Review

Use  `http-requests.py` to generate links. Use `start_chrome` and `start_edge` to automatically open links and `use_IEEE`, `use_ACM`, `use_SPRINGER`, `use_SCOPUS`, `use_WILEY`, `use_IET_DL` and `use_DBPL` to include/exclude libraries. Some pages need VPN!!!

## IEEE:

Use Export button to export up to 2,000 results as `.csv` file. Or select all the results on the page and export as a `.bib`
file

## ACM DL

Divide the query by year intervals so that there are no more than 1000 results in one query. Select all results and export.

## Springer

Divide the query by year intervals so that there are no more than 1000 results in one query. Select all results and export.
All the references have DOI that can be printed and uploaded to Citavi/Zotero.
