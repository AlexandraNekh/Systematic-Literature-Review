abstract = {From healthcare to criminal justice, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

abstract = {A surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) has led to a vast collection of algorithmic work on the topic. While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.},

abstract = {The recent focus on user-driven innovation and open innovation signals a shift of concerns beyond the new product or service it self. The very model of how to make business is at play in most innovation projects today, in particular with the advent of Internet commerce. There are already examples of participatory design methods being applied to open up the process of business modeling to a wider circle of actors than those marketing managers that typically devise new business schemes. Traditional manufacturing companies with conventional product sales are challenged to consider alternative business models. Public organizations are under increasing pressure to consider themselves a business, with all that this entails in terms of new terminology.To allow people without formal business education to take part in business model discussions means moving beyond text and spreadsheets. Designers can play a crucial role here. But participatory design of business models could sound like a contradiction in terms: Do the designers side with the exploiting rather than the exploited?This workshop invites participants to bring experience from projects where business issues were part of the participatory negotiation, and to hone their position on the larger question of the role of PD in innovation.},

Computational alternatives are used to systematically question the technological status quo and peak into a possible future; they are material manifestations of our focus and curiosity and can aid us in inquiring into possible socio-technical alternatives. Ultimately we focus on whether (and how) it is possible to maintain a technological research agenda in participatory and user-centered design, without giving up on pursuit of strong conceptual and theoretical insights.},

abstract = {We reflect on how practices of care configure workplace participatory design (PD) efforts by locating ways in which care manifests in the ambitions of actors as they confront their ambivalent relations to a smart workplace technology. We explore these issues through a participatory design effort centered around the development and implementation of a machine learning (ML) system to support the work of IT architects employed by a large global company. Following an Agile approach, these IT architects actively shaped the project's trajectories, offering feedback on various system prototypes as well as the alignment between the project's various aims and their everyday work practices. Our findings center around six standpoints (strategizing, managing, building, researching, integrating, and transforming) that organize “matters of care” emerging from our twenty-three-month-long engagement with this project. Workers inhabited different standpoints at different times (and some, at times, simultaneously), revealing a dynamic and shifting orientation toward caring. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding contemporary workplace PD efforts.},

Decolonising discourses teach us that we need to move away from the universalising ‘grand narratives’ of knowledge production and focus on contextualising diverse and situated experiences, epistemologies and narratives. Yet, few contributions actively demonstrate what a shift to decolonising PD means in practice. This interactive workshop will invigorate the gap in PD debates of decolonisation by bringing together and demonstrating how participatory designers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes, concepts, methodologies and sensibilities of PD into decolonising practices. These practices not only create new shifts and worldviews, but have potential for developing truly transcultural and transdisciplinary PD approaches},

Many technology organizations recently have established research, design, and development centers in Africa and have initiated projects with the desire to engage the talent and imaginative futures of this diverse region. This panel brings together researchers and practitioners working in Africa who are helping to direct their organizations efforts to locate the "center of design" in the settings and milieu where they work. Panelist will offer their perspectives on what it has meant for them and their organization to situate research, design, and development in Africa with a focus on their efforts to integrate participatory approaches.

In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as "designers" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies.},

abstract = {Today's news and social media are populated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) debates as promising technologies to solve real-world challenges. African researchers and practitioners are discussing the power of AI in assisting governments to address community challenges. Thus, several training and workshops are conducted in Africa to build the capacity in AI and ML. Despite the training initiatives in Africa, there is little or no research regarding the implementation of these technologies in the context, which focuses on how to overcome challenges related to technology. This paper bridges the gap by exploring the current status of AI implementation in Africa. We used an online questionnaire to examine AI initiatives in Africa governments, encountered challenges and possible solutions to address the problems. MAXQDA software was used to analyze raw data. We used findings from the ongoing empirical work to propose preliminary recommendations for successful AI/ML implementation to African governments.},

In the earlier work, collaborative design networks are proposed as a decision-theoretic framework for such a system. In this work, we analyzes how choice of agent interface affects the computational complexity of collaborative design. Based on the analysis, we proposes a set of algorithms that allow agents to produce an overall optimal design by autonomous local evaluation of local designs. We show that these algorithms reduce the complexity exponentially from that of an exhaustive centralized design.},

abstract = {Values play a central role in technology design. But beyond acknowledging the politics of technology, questions remain around where those values are coming from, which values we need, and how they play out and shape the socio-technical systems we create. New challenges such as the climate crisis and societal polarization call for technologists to become part of the public and political arena. This results in a new sense of responsibility, but the closing of CPSR, the Computing Professionals for Social Responsibility, has left a gap. Today, across tech workers, academics and computing professionals, there is a renewed sense of urgency for engaging the public and politics to change course in how computing shapes society. What should a CPSR for the 21st century look like? This interactive workshop aims to re-invigorate the debate around values and social responsibility in Participatory Design with special attention to the Latin American context.},

Forty-seven museum guides participated in a study in which they were asked to write the end of a fictional story. Participants described their impressions and implications of teaching robots who would do their jobs. This design fiction activity is expected to help grounding the debate on machine teaching paradigms, values, and social dilemmas which new technologies bring to physical spaces.},

Nonetheless, some less privileged participants can face more barriers to participation than others, e.g., being unable to exercise their voice. The literature lacks a unified source that guides PD researchers and practitioners in devising and implementing projects with groups facing more barriers to participation. This paper addresses this gap and advances the field in two ways. First, by presenting an assessment of the current state of the art through a review of 46 participatory projects that involved less privileged participants, it identifies the diversity of participants involved in these projects, and the methods and the stage of their involvement. It also frames three conceptualizations of PD and presents common challenges researchers and participants faced during these projects. Second, based on this analysis, it presents areas for further development and discusses the implications for PD.},

HRI researchers are adopting HCI methods, however, these methodologies may need slight modifications and adaptations in order to better investigate the unique challenges of working in HRI. In this paper, we present our findings which utilised one such method: Participatory Design (PD) workshop. We held the workshop in our assistive living lab with ten stroke survivors. This workshop aimed to explore the design of new socially assistive robotic technologies that could be used to support stroke survivors in the home environment. Some of our findings were unanticipated, which suggested that some adaptations to the existing framework for PD workshops need to be revised in order to be useful to HRI research.},

abstract = {There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.},

They can also be included in work with potential and actual users, particularly in eliciting user needs and concerns. We present three case studies in which personas are part of the research with potential users of interactive systems. Blind participants in research on assistive technologies often spontaneously generated personas who would benefit more from the technology than they themselves would. This was a way of being able to discuss potential needs and concerns, without admitting to having them oneself. Older participants exploring the potential of indoor drones generated personas who were older than themselves and would need the system more. Finally, personas were created to aid discussions with forestry workers about fatigue and safety issues that they might not want to admit to having themselves. From these case studies we draw recommendations for how personas can be deployed in working with potential and actual users of interactive systems in a variety of ways.},

Interest has increased among researchers investigating the potential link between CSR activity and financial performance. In this study, we propose a method of finding CSR activities related to corporate value using random forest, a machine-learning technique. The definition of CSR is ambiguous, so we used the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26000 framework as the basic standard for investigating companies, since it is a major guideline for CSR activities in Japan. Following this framework, we used 36 CSR activities as features. Results indicated that Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) is the most important activity in corporate value classification. We then used association analysis to clarify how CSR activities related to corporate value influence. Results indicated that documentation of CSR policy is often performed in parallel with other activities, whereas, stakeholder engagement is not.},

With the use of a participatory game design approach, we developed an immersive, meaningful virtual training environment to improve situational awareness skills. Feedback of game developers as well as from test groups shows that the participatory approach to game development lead to a meaningful experience within an authentic virtual training environment.

Typically unpredictable and opaque, it may produce unforeseen outcomes detrimental to particular groups or individuals, yet simultaneously promise amazing breakthroughs in areas as diverse as medical diagnosis and universal translation.

In this paper, we acknowledge the power and potential of this metaphor by resurfacing historic complexities in human-monster relations. We (re)introduce these liminal and ambiguous creatures, and discuss their relation to ML. We offer a background to designers' use of metaphor, and show how the technology-as-monster metaphor can generatively probe and (re)frame the questions ML poses. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed discussion of an early-stage generative design workshop inquiring into ML approaches to supporting student mental health and well-being.},

This service was meant to come into play once the user had completed the mourning process and accepted the loss. Despite conducting User Interviews and Brainstorming intently upon design ideas, the outcome of ideation seemed to lack the appropriate mood and sensitivity that would suit someone who reminisces upon a dear departed. The authors then approached PD to gain a deeper understanding of user needs, sensibilities and better sensitivity towards the tone of the design while dealing with a delicate subject like fond reminiscence of a dear one who has passed on.},

In this paper, we present DeepWear, a method using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for clothes design. The DNNs learn the feature of specific brand clothes and generate images then patterns instructed from the images are made, and an author creates clothes based on that. We evaluated this system by evaluating the credibility of the actual sold clothes on market with our clothes. As the result, we found it is possible to make clothes look like actual products from the generated images.

abstract = {This article presents the principles and the first results related to the implementation of a participatory design method with children. The objective of this method set up in educational environment with pupils aged 9-11 years old was to design devices supporting creativity in narrative activities. The DIMI method consists of four stages: Discover - Invent - Mix - Iterate, and integrates the child as a socio-culturally situated subject. This anthropocentric method is based on an analysis of children activity structured with their schemes in order design devices that make sense for the subject and that allow him to transform them into instruments while transforming himself. The reference situation that we analyze here with the instrumental approach (Rabardel, 1995) focuses on the creation of a collective tale.},

abstract = {Building service robots-robots that perform various services in buildings-are becoming more common in large buildings such as hotels and stores. We aim to leverage such robots to serve as guides for blind people. In this paper, we sought to design specifications that detail how a building service robot could interact with and guide a blind person through a building in an effective and socially acceptable way. We conducted participatory design sessions with three designers and five non-designers. Two of the designers and all of the non-designers had a vision disability. Primary features of the design include allowing the user to (1) summon the robot after entering the building, (2) choose from three modes of assistance (Sighted Guide, Escort, and Information Kiosk), and (3) receive information about the building's layout from the robot. We conclude with a discussion of themes and a reflection about our design process that can benefit robot design for blind people in general.},

abstract = {Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

Within it, we will scrutinise the intersections of artificial intelligence(s) and cities - i.e. urban life, spaces, places, geographies, infrastructures, and practices - from a multidisciplinary, design-oriented perspective. There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two. Traditionally, this has been the realm of design; In this workshop, we ask what themes, questions and methods should be addressed by an emerging design-oriented urban AI research community?},

abstract = {Detrimental online behavior such as harassment and cyberbullying is becoming a serious, large-scale problem damaging people's lives. This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.},

A set of guidelines have been drafted and supported with user interviews to validate the proposed design framework. Ten students with novice machine learning experience participated in the study to formulate a programming pipeline that was used to draft the guidelines based on the literary review. A problem statement was formed from the analysis of interview insights using UX Research techniques. The insights suggest that a visual sandbox approach helps reduce the learning curve of programming machine learning tasks. The design guidelines we drafted focused on the three design factors namely system intent, interaction, and algorithm visualization. Considering these guidelines, a prototype was produced that will undergo future testing and validation.},

A promising approach to movement interaction design is Interactive Machine Learning, in which designing is done by physically performing an action. This article brings together many different perspectives on understanding human movement knowledge and movement interaction. This understanding shows that the embodied knowledge involved in movement interaction is very different from the representational knowledge involved in a traditional interface, so a very different approach to design is needed. We apply this knowledge to understand why interactive machine learning is an effective tool for motion interaction designers and to make a number of suggestions for future development of the technique.},

We conduct a workshop study consisting of an ML lecture and an interactive learning session using a sound recognition system. Through observations during the workshop and semi-structured interviews, we clarify that non-expert DHH people start to overcome the knowledge gap. They could obtain a more detailed understanding of ML technology and how to use sounds to train ML models.},

Conflicts are detected according of each engineers semantics which are defined by using OWL ontologies and SWRL rules. When they are detected, the framework allows solving them by negotiating possible alternatives.

We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI. ConsultAI is a conversational assistant that can provide real-time decision support to OH physicians during clinical interviews.

We describe a new approach for realising visual differentiation in CASE tools via a set of plug-in components. We have added diagram version control, visual differentiation and merging support as component-based plug-ins to the Pounamu meta-CASE tool. The approach is generic across a wide variety of diagram types and has also been deployed with an Eclipse diagramming plug-in. We describe our approach's architecture, key design and implementation issues, illustrate feasibility of our approach via implementation of it as plug-in components and evaluate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in our everyday technologies and impacts both individuals and communities. The explainable AI (XAI) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. In addition, existing XAI research tends to focus on the individual level. Little is known about how people understand and explain AI-led decisions in the community context. Drawing from XAI and activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-AI interaction. We then present a case study of AI-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of AI-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of CSCW, HCI, and XAI.},

abstract = {Algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 5 years since its deployment.},

abstract = {Since 2014, a growing body of critical research has pointed out flaws in smart city development. It has been described as too technology-led and business-oriented, diminishing citizens' agency and causing digital divides. As the agenda keeps spreading, there is an urgent need to develop more participatory, inclusive and bottom-up approaches to balance interests of those currently in strong power positions, such as large corporations. Participatory design (PD) and participatory approaches in general have been suggested as a remedy, but they often tend to be local, small-scale and short-term. Therefore, their impacts are often modest as well. We suggest that we need to start thinking about ways to create scalable approaches that would grow the temporal and spatial impact of actions and practices that intend to increase citizens' understanding and control over new technologies, i.e. their technological agency. Without making sure that more people have adequate knowledge and sufficient control and mastery of technologies, societal discussion and ultimately, political decisions, are left to few experts. We explore the potential of public libraries to act as an ally and cooperation partner in participatory design and technology education in general, with a significant potential to broaden micro-level actions' impact.The paper consists of a broad literature review mapping the central challenges of current smart city development; this is followed with an introduction to the Finnish library system as a democratic project; finally, we present three examples of how libraries are carrying out technological education connected to emerging technologies, particularly to 3D printing, robotics and virtual reality. Our central argument is that there is a need to bridge micro-level actions, such as those connected to participatory design projects, with the macro-level technopolitical development by collaborating with meso-level actors and networks.},

During a series of participatory workshop sessions, five people with aphasia, employed as consultants, took part in game-playing activities followed by hands-on interaction with a series of iterative prototypes. The challenges we faced arose primarily from the consultants' difficulties with the production and comprehension of language, both textual and verbal, and with the retention of information. The strategies and techniques we devised to cope with these challenges evolved over the course of the workshop sessions. We discuss these and how to involve and empower users with cognitive impairments, in the context of a broadening scope of PD practices.},

The participants of the workshops were tasked with redesigning the graphical user interface (GUI) of an electronic ambulance record (EAR). Users participated primarily in the first workshop while stakeholders as well as users participated in the second. We identify the concepts of actionable and volatile ML situations that may result in solidification of a decision of either the design of the artefact or the development process. These concepts are applied post-hoc to four exemplary ML situations that occurred during the workshops: a) a ML situation where design issues of ease of use were solved by users; b) a situation where usability issues beyond the users' grasp were identified in the first workshop and solved by stakeholders and users together during the second workshop; c) and d) situations where usability issues were solved by the users in the first workshop but not discussed with stakeholders despite the fact that the users had proclaimed that the redesign could have consequences for the stakeholders in the long run. By applying the framework to the ML situations as we define situation "a" and "b" as actionable and situation "c" and "d" as volatile.},

We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach.

To do that, we refer to an European-funded project called Commonfare, aimed at designing a digital platform fostering the emergence of a new economic model in the domain of the institutions of the welfare state. We conclude by discussing how a PD political agenda based on the critique of the current forms of capitalism aligns with or challenges existing institutional frames, supporting the emergence of new institutions.},

Design fiction workshops have fruitfully facilitated users and researchers discussing and creating future technologies by exposing differing viewpoints. Yet, most scholarship focuses on the ostensibly successful outputs of these workshops. It remains unclear exactly what sort of interaction dynamics are instigated by design fiction in collaborative design. How might design fiction affect what we consider in design, and how is this reflected in the ensuing design? To fill this gap, our study examines design fictions across five workshops where diverse participants created futuristic autobiographies, a method to elicit values, and built diegetic prototypes both individually and collaboratively. We detail their design processes and unpack three kinds of soft conflicts that arose between participants and allowed them to bring up and discuss differing values regarding technology in society. Reflecting on our workshops, we discuss their implications on how one might employ design fiction in collaborative design.},

ADMINS explores the potential of a conversational user interface (CUI) to reduce administrative burden and improve outcomes, by replacing static forms with written and spoken dialogue. Students with accessibility needs often face excessive administrative burden. A CUI could be beneficial in this context if designed to be fully accessible. At the same time, we recognise the broader potential of CUIs for these types of processes, and the project aims to understand the multiple opportunities and challenges, using participatory design, iterative development and trials evaluations.},

We present an eight-month multi-phase case study for a translational platform, ECHOS, that uses primary caregivers' unique knowledge to enhance communicative and affective exchanges between mvASD individuals and the broader community. Through iterative development and participatory design, we discovered that physiological sensors were impractical for long-term use, on-body audio was content rich and easily accessible, and a custom in-the-moment labeling app was transformative in obtaining accurate labels from caregivers for machine learning advancements.

abstract = {Creative generative machine learning interfaces are stronger when multiple actors bearing different points of view actively contribute to them. User experience (UX) research and design involvement in the creation of machine learning (ML) models help ML research scientists to more effectively identify human needs that ML models will fulfill. The People and AI Research (PAIR) group within Google developed a novel program method in which UXers are embedded into an ML research group for three months to provide a human-centered perspective on the creation of ML models. The first full-time cohort of UXers were embedded in a team of ML research scientists focused on deep generative models to assist in music composition. Here, we discuss the structure and goals of the program, challenges we faced during execution, and insights gained as a result of the process. We offer practical suggestions for how to foster communication between UX and ML research teams and recommended UX design processes for building creative generative machine learning interfaces.},

In this context, there is a need for methodologies to help designers and users create meaningful movement experiences. This article discusses a user-centered approach for the design of interactive auditory feedback using interactive machine learning. We discuss Mapping through Interaction, a method for crafting sonic interactions from corporeal demonstrations of embodied associations between motion and sound. It uses an interactive machine learning approach to build the mapping from user demonstrations, emphasizing an iterative design process that integrates acted and interactive experiences of the relationships between movement and sound. We examine Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression for continuous movement recognition and real-time sound parameter generation. We illustrate and evaluate this approach through an application in which novice users can create interactive sound feedback based on coproduced gestures and vocalizations. Results indicate that Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression can efficiently learn complex motion-sound mappings from few examples.},

The field of Design typically deals with form and function and is executed in molecules or pixels. But algorithms have neither. More importantly, algorithms may be biased in their execution against those without privileged status such as people of color, children, and the non-affluent. In this paper, we review our work on exploring perceptions of fairness in AI through co-design sessions with children of color in non-affluent neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The design sessions aimed at designing an artificially intelligent librarian for their local branch. Our preliminary findings showcase three key themes of this group's perceptions of fairness in the context of an artificially intelligent authority figure.},

Preliminary findings indicate that trust can be enhanced in CUIs through greater transparency of actions, enhanced control and clearer privacy settings. It also suggests that design should account for the ways in which trust manifests in sensitive user contexts, like tenancies based on preestablished relationships and power dynamics.},

The analysis, based on participant observation and facilitation in nine collaborative research settings, identifies commonalities on how some issues of uncertainty in collaborative knowledge generation contexts can be addressed by both techniques. Results point to the possibility of using dotmocracy and planning poker for articulating decision-making processes among different available options, in order to find consensus in a visual way, and at the same time to make more explicit the degree of agreement and risk perceptions in relation to scientific activities.},

We present a participatory design methodology for culturally tailoring virtual agents. Investigators worked with key informants from our target population, members of predominantly Black church communities, to design culturally-relevant and sensitive virtual agent health promotion interventions. In the first participatory session, key informants designed agents to assist them with different aspects of their lives, providing input on agent appearance and agent functionality. In a second design session, participants re-wrote the content of a health conversation with an agent, to include personally-relevant content related to their community (e.g., religious and scriptural references). We report design principles for religious tailoring derived from these studies. We conducted a validation study to assess the effects of applying these principles to agents that promoted two health behaviors, finding that participants responded very positively to the tailored agents.},

abstract = {Concerns about "black box" machine learning algorithms have influenced why modern data protection laws and regulations on their establishment of a right to human intervention on decision-making supported by artificial intelligence. Such interventions provide data subjects with means to protect their rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, either as a bare minimum requirement for data processing or as a central norm governing decision-aiding artificial intelligence. In this paper, I present contestability by design as an approach to two kinds of issues with current legal implementations of the right to human intervention. The first kind is the uncertainty about what kind of decision should be covered by this right: should intervention be restricted to those decisions with no human involvement, or should it be interpreted in a broader sense, encompassing all decisions that are effectively shaped by automated processing? The second class of issues ensues from practical limitations of this right to intervention: even within a clear conceptual framework, data subjects might still lack the information they need to the concrete exercise of their right, or the human intervention itself might introduce biases and limitations that result in undesirable outcomes. After discussing how those effects can be identified and measured, I then advance the thesis that proper protection of the rights of data subjects is feasible only if there are means for contesting decisions based solely on automated processing is not an afterthought, but instead a requirement at each stage of an artificial intelligence system's lifecycle.},

abstract = {Computer aided design (CAD), the use of computer systems for design and documentation, is prevalent in industrial and architectural design, but largely features passive software to follow user interaction. In the past decade, there have been multiple efforts in implementing multi-objective optimization algorithms and machine learning for data analytics in the area of computational optimization of building designs. This research initially explored the technical review of presented designs, and subsequently began to explore the creation of novel forms based on design constraints in addition to parameter optimization. Most notably in the conceptualization phase of the process, the designer is largely unassisted as current existing CAD software focuses on the modeling and basic structural analysis of already created designs. In this position paper, we propose a conceptual framework to leverage computer-assisted creativity in building and form design using evolutionary algorithms, complimented with a comprehensive review of the approaches of other research. We present the preliminary results of our rudimentary implementation of ArchiGen (Architectural Generator), a tool for assisting designers in the conceptualization of a design by presenting alternative forms based on design constraints. ArchiGen uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to create alternative designs of a pillar-pod-antenna structured observation tower as a case study and explores the potential of combining optimal and sub-optimal solutions based on the specified design constraints.},

As algorithmic decision making increasingly affects our lives, calls to improve the transparency of these systems are met with social, legal and technical limitations that challenge whether transparency alone is the solution to algorithmic accountability. In my dissertation, I explore the role of algorithmic tranparency, algorithmic literacy and related issues as approaches towards holding algorithmic systems more accountable. Bridging HCI and STS communities, my work is grounded in a critical ethnography of algorithmic systems and their impact on its stakeholders. Through this approach, I aim to provide both theoretical insights and material solutions to the problem of accountability. By unpacking the complex socio-technical assemblage that make up these systems and employing both participatory and user-centred design principles, my goal is to co-design measures that support sense-making of algorithmic processes and allow holding these systems accountable.},

abstract = {We present the STEX+ system, a user-driven advancement of STEX --- a semantic extension of LATEX that allows for producing high-quality PDF documents for (proof)reading and printing, as well as semantic XML/OMDoc documents for the Web or further processing. Originally STEX had been created as an invasive, semantic frontend for authoring XML documents. Here, we used STEX in a Software Engineering case study as a formalization tool. In order to deal with modular pre-semantic vocabularies and relations, we upgraded it to STEX+ in a participatory design process. We present a tool chain that starts with an STEX+ editor and ultimately serves the generated documents as XHTML+RDFa Linked Data via an OMDoc-enabled, versioned XML database. In the final output, all structural annotations are preserved in order to enable semantic information retrieval services.},

abstract = {During mass casualty incidents, an enormous amount of data, including the vital signs of the patients, the location of the patients, and the location of the first responders must be gathered and communicated efficiently. The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network (AID-N) used participatory design methods to develop an electronic triage system that changed how emergency personnel interacted, collected, and processed data at mass casualty incidents. Through a collaboration between computer scientists, biomedical engineers, usability analysts, paramedics, and medical doctors, AID-N constructed scalable algorithms to monitor a large numbers of patients, an intuitive interface to support overwhelmed responders, and an ad-hoc mesh network that maintained connectivity to patients in ad-hoc, chaotic settings. This paper describes an iterative approach to user-centered design that allows for the collection of a massive amount of data and presents this data in a clear and understandable format to the user.},

abstract = {The rapid digitalization of the Facility Management (FM) sector has increased the demand for mobile, interactive analytics approaches concerning the operational state of a building. These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.},

To do this, we developed an interactive design tool to simulate static and dynamic light signals. With this tool, we conducted a participatory design study in which designers were asked to create light signals for 16 robot states. The results showed the possibility of employing dynamic attributes to enhance human awareness of robot state, rather than merely the state itself.},

We used participatory design, creating a design team with three designers and five non-designers. All but one member of the team had a visual impairment.

Therefore EPA design should include both user characteristics and the pedagogical purposes behind the CAL system. This paper presents the participatory design of an EPA's affective responses to children's interaction with mathematical software. The participatory design sessions were performed with teachers as partners in designing the affective learning components. The results of a pilot study on children's responses to the emotional sequence defined in the model will be introduced, as a separate study. Finally, a plan of future research is presented to further validate the model's potential for CAL systems, including the integration two software learning applications constructed during the design sessions with teachers},

Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.},

abstract = {Major natural or man-made disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the 9/11 terror attacks pose significant challenges for emergency responders. First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in the most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowd-sourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system.},

While the goal of critical technical practice as proposed by [1] is to overcome technical impasses, I explore an alternative use case - ensuring that technical research is aligned with social values. In the design of AI systems, we generally start with a technical formulation of a problem and then attempt to build a system that addresses that problem. Critical technical practice tells us that this technical formulation is always founded upon the discipline's core discourse and ontology, and that difficulty in solving a technical problem might just result from inconsistencies and faults in those core attributes. What I hope to show with this project is that, even when a technical problem seems solvable, critical technical practice can and should be used to ensure the human-compatibility of the technical research.},

abstract = {In recent years, several types of modalities and features have emerged as an important input methods to control technological devices and software in various contexts for better interaction. Many studies were conducted in diverse aspects to find usable and useful features and functionalities. In this paper, we discuss how to design and structure a participatory design workshop and wizard of Oz with users, especially in the situation of developing a new presentation tool. Our approach to structure participatory design is to embed three phases based on principles of human-centered design. We extend the design method to achieve more useful and usable concepts. In the first phase, end-users engaged in building initial concepts. In the second phase, the users evaluated their initial idea and refined the design concepts. In the last phase, extended user groups gave feedback about usability issues in the tested platform. In the lessons learned, we highlight two major issues observed in this our design method: (a) evolving design fidelity and (b) comprehension of own design.},

Digital support for journalists when investigating and writing about science-related topics is one means of improving this science communication. However, little bespoke digital support is available. This paper reports the research and development of one new form of such digital support. During a participatory design process, experienced science journalists and other professionals were interviewed about their challenges experienced and understanding of good practices in science journalism. These challenges and good practices informed the development of a prototype of a new form of digital tool that was evaluated by journalists without specialist science training. A new version of the prototype, called INQUEST, was implemented to automate some parts of good practices in order to augment journalists’ capabilities. These practices included the retrieval of science information from diverse sources, targeting different science audiences, and providing different forms of guidance for explaining science to the target audience. This prototype is presented, and an early evaluation of it is reported.},

In this work, we investigate the key types of information medical experts desire when they are first introduced to a diagnostic AI assistant. In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.},

Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.},

abstract = {City, municipal, and state governments around the globe are increasingly looking towards algorithmic solutions to long-standing and difficult problems in governance. We use the term algorithmic governance to capture this increasing use of predictive and other algorithms to provide efficiencies in the targeting of services and government processes. However, in the course of pursuing these efficiencies, openness, transparency, public accountability, and community-based deliberation, key pillars of democracy, come under threat when decision making is black-boxed in an algorithm. Furthermore, algorithmic governance (for example, in domains like welfare management) typically exacerbates the marginalization of the most disadvantaged in society, while simultaneously making such marginalization invisible to the larger citizenry. A hybrid technology assessment (TA) comprising of elements of both participatory TA (that involves public debate about technology) and constructive TA (that involves co-construction of technology between society and designers) employed through the framework of engineering technology for social justice, may help address these challenges.},

abstract = {Nonverbal vocalizations contain important affective and communicative information, especially for those who do not use traditional speech, including individuals who have autism and are non- or minimally verbal (nv/mv). Although these vocalizations are often understood by those who know them well, they can be challenging to understand for the community-at-large. This work presents (1) a methodology for collecting spontaneous vocalizations from nv/mv individuals in natural environments, with no researcher present, and personalized in-the-moment labels from a family member; (2) speaker-dependent classification of these real-world sounds for three nv/mv individuals; and (3) an interactive application to translate the nonverbal vocalizations in real time. Using support-vector machine and random forest models, we achieved speaker-dependent unweighted average recalls (UARs) of 0.75, 0.53, and 0.79 for the three individuals, respectively, with each model discriminating between 5 nonverbal vocalization classes. We also present first results for real-time binary classification of positive- and negative-affect nonverbal vocalizations, trained using a commercial wearable microphone and tested in real time using a smartphone. This work informs personalized machine learning methods for non-traditional communicators and advances real-world interactive augmentative technology for an underserved population.},

However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology.},

An interactive electronic format also allows including multiple languages without sacrificing space on a page for attractive images---both key features for teaching young children to read in a setting where multiple languages are spoken in the home, or where a mother tongue is not the language of instruction. This paper describes collaborative development of a digital, multi-language reading tool that facilitates translation of local stories by Kenyan community groups, led by a librarian, into a mother tongue. Despite being built faithfully using a well-established design methodology in an iterative process among beneficiaries, program leaders, and technologists, and in a process embedded in a program also designed according to those design standards, tool development has faced serious challenges. This paper uses a principal agent model to identify technology-mediated communication and spatial distance among critical participants as major hindrances to progress. Analysis reveals critical disparities between, on one hand, the design thinking of development practitioners and funders, which rhetorically promote a circular, dynamic, participatory design process, and, on the other hand, traditional funding structures which impose at least partial adherence to a top-down approach.},

Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.},

abstract = {Sociotechnical imaginaries are futures that people envision might be possible and desirable. They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers' disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers' disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.},

abstract = {Words and language are central to most human communication. This paper explores the importance of language for the participatory design of smart home technologies for healthcare. We argue that to effectively involve a broad range of users in the design of new technologies, it is important to actively develop a shared language that is accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that facilitates productive dialogues among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly in work with end users, in which problematic language emerged as a key barrier to participation and effective design. Three specific categories of language barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words. Building on this we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on generating a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that emerged of alternative terminology and specific strategies for creating a shared language.},

In response, corporations, non-profits, and academic researchers have mobilized to build responsible AI, yet how to do this is unclear. Toward this aim, we designed Judgment Call, a game for industry product teams to surface ethical concerns using value sensitive design and design fiction. Through two industry workshops, we found Judgment Call to be effective for considering technology from multiple perspectives and identifying ethical concerns. This work extends value sensitive design and design fiction to ethical AI and demonstrates the game's effective use in industry.},

In these so-called "bottom-up" approaches, users are becoming designers of their game experience. In this paper, we report on an online study where participants (n=140) described a gamification concept, without restricting them to a set of game elements to select from. This was done to analyze how they perform in such a task. The concepts were qualitatively evaluated for which game elements were proposed, showing that participants suggested many diverse concepts with a broad range of elements. The results provide further support for "bottom-up" approaches. Additionally, the suggested game elements were compared to every participant's Hexad user type and Big Five personality. Our data hints that both seem not to be dominant factors influencing which elements participants use in such a design task.},

abstract = {In society today, people experiencing disability can face discrimination. As artificial intelligence solutions take on increasingly important roles in decision-making and interaction, they have the potential to impact fair treatment of people with disabilities in society both positively and negatively. We describe some of the opportunities and risks across four emerging AI application areas: employment, education, public safety, and healthcare, identified in a workshop with participants experiencing a range of disabilities. In many existing situations, non-AI solutions are already discriminatory, and introducing AI runs the risk of simply perpetuating and replicating these flaws. We next discuss strategies for supporting fairness in the context of disability throughout the AI development lifecycle. AI systems should be reviewed for potential impact on the user in their broader context of use. They should offer opportunities to redress errors, and for users and those impacted to raise fairness concerns. People with disabilities should be included when sourcing data to build models, and in testing, to create a more inclusive and robust system. Finally, we offer pointers into an established body of literature on human-centered design processes and philosophies that may assist AI and ML engineers in innovating algorithms that reduce harm and ultimately enhance the lives of people with disabilities.},

Such barriers increase especially when it comes to ensuring and supporting the participation of children with varying or complex needs, or when prospective participants are geographically distributed. This workshop aims to create the basis of a distributed PD (DPD) protocol to provide practical advice in overcoming the challenges of ensuring inclusivity for children with varying or complex needs around the world. The protocol will build on the participants' prior experience and on a live PD design session with children and adults, and be guided by discussions around approaches to address a specific design problem while maximising inclusivity across geographical boundaries and research contexts. It is intended to become a springboard for the world's most inclusive Distributed PD project.},

In the preliminary analysis, we observe that the use of a shared fiction relieved participants of the requirement to disclose very personal experiences, but nonetheless established a group understanding of what makes racist experiences difficult and supported a generative conversation about how technology might ease these situations.},

However, designing an effective solution in this complex domain represents a "wicked design" problem, requiring a careful balance between trade-offs associated with drone autonomy versus human control, mission functionality versus safety, and the diverse needs of different stakeholders. This paper focuses on designing for situational awareness (SA) using a scenario-driven, participatory design process. We developed SA cards describing six common design-problems, known as SA demons, and three new demons of importance to our domain. We then used these SA cards to equip domain experts with SA knowledge so that they could more fully engage in the design process. We designed a potentially reusable solution for achieving SA in multi-stakeholder, multi-UAV, emergency response applications.},

Through formative interviews with 11 active moderators from 10 different subreddits, we learned about the limitations of currently available automated tools, and how a new system could extend their capabilities. Developed out of these interviews, Crossmod makes its decisions based on cross-community learning---an approach that leverages a large corpus of previous moderator decisions via an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, we deployed Crossmod in a controlled environment, simulating real-time conversations from two large subreddits with over 10M subscribers each. To evaluate Crossmod's moderation recommendations, 4 moderators reviewed comments scored by Crossmod that had been drawn randomly from existing threads. Crossmod achieved an overall accuracy of 86% when detecting comments that would be removed by moderators, with high recall (over 87.5%). Additionally, moderators reported that they would have removed 95.3% of the comments flagged by Crossmod; however, 98.3% of these comments were still online at the time of this writing (i.e., not removed by the current moderation system). To the best of our knowledge, Crossmod is the first open source, AI-backed sociotechnical moderation system to be designed using participatory methods.},

To better understand children's awareness of online stranger danger and explore their visions for technologies that can help them manage related online risks (e.g., sexual solicitations and cyberbullying), we held two participatory design sessions with 12 children (ages 8-11 years old). We found that children desired varying levels of agency, depending on the severity of the risk. In most cases, they wanted help resolving the issue themselves instead of relying on their parents to do it for them. Children also believed that social media apps should take on more responsibility in promoting online safety for children. We discuss the children's desires for agency, privacy, and automated intelligent assistance and provide novel design recommendations inspired by children.},

The potential to foster new forms of multisensory interaction through various sensor, mobile and haptic technologies is promising in providing new ways for young children to engage with key mathematical concepts. However, designing effective learning environments for real world classrooms is challenging, and requires a pedagogically, rather than technologically, driven approach to design. This paper describes initial work underpinning the development of a pedagogical framework, intended to inform the design of a multisensory serious gaming environment. It identifies the theoretical basis of the framework, illustrates how this informs teaching strategies, and outlines key technology research driven perspectives and considerations important for informing design. An initial table mapping mathematical concepts to design, a framework of considerations for design, and a process model of how the framework will continue to be developed across the design process are provided.},

abstract = {Esports (competitive videogames) have grown into a global phenomenon with over 450m viewers and a 1.5bn USD market. Esports broadcasts follow a similar structure to traditional sports. However, due to their virtual nature, a large and detailed amount data is available about in-game actions not currently accessible in traditional sport. This provides an opportunity to incorporate novel insights about complex aspects of gameplay into the audience experience – enabling more in-depth coverage for experienced viewers, and increased accessibility for newcomers. Previous research has only explored a limited range of ways data could be incorporated into esports viewing (e.g. data visualizations post-match) and only a few studies have investigated how the presentation of statistics impacts spectators’ experiences and viewing behaviors. We present Weavr, a companion app that allows audiences to consume data-driven insights during and around esports broadcasts. We report on deployments at two major tournaments, that provide ecologically valid findings about how the app’s features were experienced by audiences and their impact on viewing behavior. We discuss implications for the design of second-screen apps for live esports events, and for traditional sports as similar data becomes available for them via improved tracking technologies.},

Addressing these complex issues requires active collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including children. Nonetheless, even if emergent technologies are becoming increasingly present in education, most technology-mediated educational projects for children tend to focus on the development of technical skills, leaving little room for critical reflection. This tendency runs the risk of missing opportunities to truly empower children as critical users, (future) responsible designers and skilled stakeholders in the dialogue around ethical concerns on technology. Starting from this perspective, the workshop aims at tracing research lines and opening questions around strategies, methods, tools, and perspectives to support children in developing an ethical and critical sensitivity in the use, design, and development of emergent technologies.},

However, if we consider these robots as social interventions, then it is important to recognize that the robots design - its behavior, its application, its appearance, even its marketing image - will have an impact on the society and in the spaces it enters. While in some cases this may be a positive effect, social robots can also contribute negatively, e.g., reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting ageist views. This full-day workshop aims to offer a forum for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers to explore this issue, and to work toward potential opportunities for the field. Ultimately, we want to promote robots for social good that can contribute to positive social changes for socio-political issues (e.g., ageism, feminism, homelessness, environmental issues). The political aspects of technologies have long been scrutinized in related areas such as Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In particular, critical design explicitly targets the design of technologies that can contribute to our understanding of how technology can impact society. This workshop aims to strengthen this discussion in the HRI community, with the goal of working toward initial recommendations for how HRI designers can include elements of critical design in their work.},

abstract = {The increasing presence of robotics, automated systems, and AI in everyday life is carrying important ethical and social implications for both those who design and develop them as well as for the users. Addressing these complex issues requires active collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including children. Nonetheless, even if emergent technologies are becoming increasingly present in education, most technology-mediated educational projects for children tend to focus on the development of technical skills, leaving little room for critical reflection. This tendency runs the risk of missing opportunities to truly empower children as critical users, (future) responsible designers and skilled stakeholders in the dialogue around ethical concerns on technology. Starting from this perspective, the workshop aims at tracing research lines and opening questions around strategies, methods, tools, and perspectives to support children in developing an ethical and critical sensitivity in the use, design, and development of emergent technologies},

Continuously, all players could then choose ideas which were implemented and released on a daily basis. We conducted an exploratory study with 25 players over the course of 23 days and aimed at releasing two features per day. We analyzed idea types and could show that players did not change an idea voting scheme based on up- and down-votes and were more focused on changing the game than any other component. In contrast, features that would improve the community feeling or would help to improve ideas of others were not often suggested or selected. Nonetheless, the experience was rated as quite enjoyable by players, showing the appeal of such a player-driven game design approach and the relevancy for further research in this context.},

Our Video Calling for Autism prototype provided an Expressiveness Mirror that gave feedback to autistic people on how their facial expressions might be interpreted by their neurotypical conversation partners. This feedback was in the form of emojis representing six emotions and a bar indicating the amount of overall expressiveness demonstrated by the user. However, when we built a working prototype and conducted a user study with autistic participants, their negative feedback caused us to reconsider how our design process led to a prototype that they did not find useful. We reflect on the design challenges around developing AI technology for an autistic user population, how Wizard of Oz prototypes can be overly optimistic in representing AI-driven prototypes, how autistic research participants can respond differently to user experience prototypes of varying fidelity, and how designing for people with diverse abilities needs to include that population in the development process.},

This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Our results of an elicitation study with professional translators indicate that a combination of pen, touch, and speech could well support common PE tasks, and received high subjective ratings by our participants. Therefore, we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other hand, eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected during PE.},

However, this is not yet commonplace in Learning Analytics (LA). Co-design techniques from other domains therefore have much to offer to LA, in principle, but there are few detailed accounts of exactly how such sessions unfold. This paper presents the rationale driving a card-based co-design tool specifically tuned for LA, called LA-DECK. In the context of a pilot study with students, educators, LA researchers and developers, we provide qualitative and quantitative accounts of how participants used the cards. Using three different forms of analysis (transcript-centric design vignettes, card-graphs and time-on-topic), we characterise in what ways the sessions were "participatory" in nature, and argue that the cards succeeded in playing very similar roles to those documented in the literature on successful card-based design tools.},

However, there are pitfalls along this path, which introduce heterogeneity in the gathered data, and which are rooted in the diversity of the involved device platforms, hardware, software versions and participants. Thus, we, as a research community, need to establish good practices and methodologies for addressing this issue in order to help ensure that, e.g., scientific results and policy changes based on collective, mobile sensed data are valid. In this paper, we aim to inform researchers and developers about mobile sensing data heterogeneity and ways to combat it. We do so via distilling a vocabulary of underlying causes, and via describing their effects on mobile sensing---building on experiences from three projects within citizen science, crowd awareness and trajectory tracking.},

We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs’ potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.},

Due to the potential to immerse participants in a simulated environment, purpose-built games and scenarios might prove valuable as empirical tools. As a case study of gamifying bioethics, we describe the co-design and implementation of "What Lies Ahead?", a digital role-play scenario for research with adolescents. "What Lies Ahead?" engages young people with ethical issues related to predictive technologies in psychiatry. As preliminary evidence of the validity of this gamified approach, we report qualitative results suggesting that the role-play was immersive, and elicited authentic responses and reflective thinking in adolescent participants. Even though application of game-play mechanics is rare in bioethics, we find digital role-play to be a powerful tool that collects data through real-time, realistic scenarios.},

Our findings showed seven domains of user expectations on these roles, and we realized that all the expectations can be represented as family cohesion. In addition, privacy awareness was emphasized regarding personal supports. Finally, we discuss a new perspective for AI speaker design and offer two suggestions: 1) leveraging human-likeness to develop its potential roles of supporting the unit of a family and 2) interpreting the home context to seamlessly connect family and personal supporting roles.},

abstract = {Delivering a presentation has been reported as one of the most anxiety-provoking tasks faced by English Language Learners. Researchers suggest that instructors should be more aware of the learners' emotional states to provide appropriate emotional and instructional scaffolding to improve their performance when presenting. Despite the critical role of instructors in perceiving the emotional states among English language learners, it can be challenging to do this solely by observing the learners? facial expressions, behaviors, and their limited verbal expressions due to language and cultural barriers. To address the ambiguity and inconsistency in interpreting the emotional states of the students, this research focuses on identifying the potential of using biosensor-based feedback of learners to support instructors. A novel approach has been adopted to classify the intensity and characteristics of public speaking anxiety and foreign language anxiety among English language learners and to provide tailored feedback to instructors while supporting teaching and learning. As part of this work, two further studies were proposed. The first study was designed to identify educators' needs for solutions providing emotional and instructional support. The second study aims to evaluate a resulting prototype as a view of instructors to offer tailored emotional and instructional scaffolding to students. The contribution of these studies includes the development of guidance in using biosensor-based feedback that will assist English language instructors in teaching and identifying the students' anxiety levels and types while delivering a presentation.},

This methodology was applied in a project for designing game concepts for and with senior citizens. The research started off by observing and probing senior citizens in their 'natural habitat', researching what positive experiences occur in their daily life. These observed passions then became the input for brainstorm sessions. Seniors and researchers generated game-ideas and, consequently, co-designed the selected ideas into game concepts.The results of this methodology are inspiring game concepts, directly grafted on the passions and desires of the senior. But more important than the actual game concepts, we conceived a model of passions in elderly life. This model provides game designers with an understanding of the ingredients that are fundamental to 'meaningful play' in elderly life.},

In this methodology, we use production rules to describe agent models for approximating users, and multiagent scenarios to describe interaction models among services and their users. To learn agent and interaction models incrementally from simulations and experiments, we establish the participatory design loop with deductive machine learning technologies.},

abstract = {Data science has become more and more powerful as the development of algorithms and computing power has made huge progresses. Researchers have used machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to solve hard problems in a variety of domains. Nevertheless, data science will only show its true potential the moment that all categories of interested parties (not only specialist data scientists) will be capable of understanding and interacting with data.This work, hence, is not about data science in a classical way, but about exploring the data-human interface that may be possible to establish utilizing available tools, with little or no background knowledge of how a data science pipeline works.In this paper we show how, within a Sports Science degree course, where no specific knowledge regarding algorithms, statistics or data science is acquired, it was possible to obtain significant results in relation to a data analysis problem, using off-the-shelf application packages. In particular, we here show how, without any specific customization, it has been possible to employ the machine and deep learning algorithms offered by the publicly available platforms, to solve a fitness exercise classification problem, obtaining performances that would have been deemed remarkable until not long ago.},

In this paper we report on design-for-error workshops with children (age 5-10) in which we staged 3 simulated errors with a health assessment technology. In our developmentally-sensitive study, children witnessed the errors via a puppet show and created low-fidelity models of recovery mechanisms using familiar 'play-things'. We found the children were able to grasp the representational nature of the task. Their ideas were playful and inspired by magical thinking. Their work forced us to reflect on and revisit our own design assumptions. The tasks have had a direct impact on the design of the assessment.},

abstract = {Despite the increased demand, popularity, and cultural significance of streaming media and digital entertainment, many individuals with disabilities are unable to experience this content. Specifically, many video streaming technologies require input devices and content browsers that are inaccessible to individuals with sensory and physical impairments and do not work with their current assistive technologies. Our team of engineers, designers, and clinicians took an inclusive approach to assessing and redesigning these streaming service products, with the aim of creating more universally accessible experiences. We recruited 9 participants with diverse abilities to evaluate the accessibility of a large telecommunication company's commercially available video streaming products. This evaluation revealed significant accessibility barriers and informed the design of a participatory design activity to create accessible remote-controls, an onboarding assistance prototype, and a content browsing prototype that is screen reader accessible and supports audio descriptions. We evaluated these accessible prototypes with 11 additional participants and found they were more accessible, flexible, and enjoyable to use compared to the off-the shelf products. In this paper we summarize these findings and discuss how future streaming technology must support customization and follow established accessibility guidelines and standards.},

abstract = {As more children's technologies are designed to be used with a global audience, new tools need to be created to include more children's voices in the design process. However, working with those children who are geographically distributed as design partners is difficult because existing technologies either do not support distributed design, or are not child-friendly. Industries that produce items for children to consume have begun using traditionally academic co-design techniques in order to design new products and experiences for children. As these groups need to reach out to more diverse and global populations, they will begin using technologies that support distributed co-design. As child-computer interaction researchers, we have a duty to understand this concept and identify recommendations for others to use that incorporate the ideals of our field. In order to do this, this paper describes the design process of an online environment to support geographically distributed, intergenerational co-design. Within this environment, children can work together despite differences of time zones, geographic location, or availability. The online environment was deployed for eight weeks during the summer and was modified each week throughout that time to better support the participants. Based on the experiences of participants within the environment, we make suggestions for new technologies including user management tools, creative expression tools, and ad hoc team membership that encourage more voices in the design process.},

abstract = {With the development of service-oriented computing environments, more and more Web services have become available. Service providers have to consider how to design composite services to meet requirements from various users. However, QoS of composite service is difficult to evaluate and predict due to the uncertainty and multiple metrics of QoS, which makes it necessary for user-centered design of composite services. Moreover, combining human services and Web services is becoming an important issue in service composition in cases that Web services cannot meet the requirements from users. Therefore, it is necessary to test the service composition environments for human-computer interaction and study human behaviors. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a participatory service design approach based on user-centered QoS considering a real-world case of field-based multi-language communication service design. To achieve this goal, we first describe the QoS model for service design considering users' requirements. Then, we propose the participatory service design process, consisting of service model refinement, participatory simulation, QoS evaluation and QoS data update. Finally, we use the field study of multi-language service design for Vietnamese agricultural knowledge communication to illustrate our proposed design methodology.},

abstract = {The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design.This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO’s utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.},

Within educational applications, recent empirical research has shown that signal-level features of students’ writing, such as stroke distance, pressure and duration, are adapted to conserve total energy expenditure as they consolidate expertise in a domain. The present research examined how accurately three different machine-learning algorithms could automatically classify users’ domain expertise based on signal features of their writing, without any content analysis. Compared with an unguided machine-learning classification accuracy of 71%, hybrid methods using empirical-statistical guidance correctly classified 79–92% of students by their domain expertise level. In addition to improved accuracy, the hybrid approach contributed a causal understanding of prediction success and generalization to new data. These novel findings open up opportunities to design new automated learning analytic systems and student-adaptive educational technologies for the rapidly expanding sector of commercial pen systems.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation aims to ameliorate deficits in motor control via intensive practice with the affected limb. Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers. We present the initial quantitative results, which support several aspects of our design rationales and conclude with our future study plans.},

In this paper, such a CPS named D&amp;RSense has been proposed to promote smart transportation in order to make travelling more comfortable and safe. By studying driving patterns of drivers, D&amp;RSense can get valuable insights to their braking and accelerating styles which can help to give them real-time warnings when they drive aggressively. Detection of rash driving prone areas across the city can help to recommend which areas of the city need stricter surveillance. D&amp;RSense involves smartphones of commuters and utilizes their accelerometer and GPS sensors to detect driving events like braking and acceleration as well as poor road conditions like bumps and potholes by applying the ensemble learning method for classification, Random Forest (RF). The accuracy of the same has been compared to other supervised machine learning classifiers like Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Rash-driving prone areas and poor road segments during the course of the experiment have been plotted using Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Effectiveness of the proposed application has been evaluated through extensive testing.},

The prototype was assessed in seven focus groups with a total of 26 participants and with the AttrakDiff questionnaire. We found out that the persona view, the user journey view and the flexible filters of our prototype allowed designers to gain a insightful picture of users' experiences. Future work is needed to better understand how digitally-mediated empathic relationships evolve over the long term.},

abstract = {In this paper, we argue that atypical cognitive, perceptual and behavioral characteristics associated with serious mental illnesses should be taken into consideration when designing health technologies. While applications have been developed to assist in the treatment of these illnesses, the specific psychological characteristics of these disorders have rarely been considered extensively in the design process. Here, we explore how an understanding of the low-level characteristics of bipolar disorder, combined with a clinically-validated treatment and patients' lived experience, can inform mHealth design. We present a novel method -- in situ design -- to support ecologically valid design, and demonstrate its use through the co-development with 9 individuals with bipolar disorder of MoodRhythm, a mobile application designed to track and stabilize daily routines. We provide evidence that mHealth design elements tailored to the characteristics and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder can result in engaging interactions.},

abstract = {Smart homes have long been proposed as a viable mechanism to promote independent living for older adults in the home environment. Despite tremendous progress on the technology front, there has been limited uptake by end-users. A critical barrier to the adoption of smart home technology by older adults is the lack of engagement of end-users in the development process and the resulting one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to recognize the specific needs of the older adult demographic. In this paper, we propose a novel online platform aimed at closing the gap between older adults and technology developers: ASPIRE (Alignment of Social Personas in Inclusive Research Engagement). ASPIRE is an online collaborative network (OCN) that allows older adults, care partners, and developers to engage in the design and development of a joint shared product: the smart-home solution. To promote the adoption of the OCN and the alignment of this collaborative network with the values and emotional needs of its end-users, ASPIRE harnesses a social-psychological theory of identity. This paper presents ASPIRE as a conceptual model, with a preliminary implementation.},

As a contribution to this aim, we present the framework we developed to analyze the way we attempted to contextualize the ontologies underlying a set of semantic knowledge services dedicated to communities of practice. The framework was derived from the "Ontology Framework" elaborated by members of the Ontology Engineering community during the Ontology Summit 2007. Both frameworks define a series of "pragmatic dimensions" of ontologies. Because our derived framework does not cover all possible dimensions, we propose to complement it, by relying on existing work from the Ontology Engineering community in general, and from the Pragmatic Web community in particular. In conclusion, we invite the Pragmatic Web community to pursue such a work by jointly elaborating a consensual "Pragmatic Ontology Framework".},

Scribbles uses shape recognition, to allow freehand manipulation of a hybrid Mind Map. This preserves the simplicity of paper or a whiteboard whilst adding the ability to capture early design ideas in a reusable way. This is a very lightweight modeling environment ideally suited to introducing students to Object Oriented Design.},

This program is designed for pregnant women in rural Assam in India. We observed the gestures of 24 pregnant women to determine how to present the following seven computational functions that were used in the health information program: Select, Pause, Resume, Help, Activate Menu, Next, and Previous. The participants belonged to the low socio-economic strata in rural Assam, India and most had poor literacy levels. A participatory approach through a user-generated gesture collection method was used for this study. This study produced a total of 49 different gestures that participants performed to represent the seven computational functions. We selected seven body gestures based on the frequency of use, logical suitability to represent functions, the decreased possibility that the gestures would be accidently performed (false positives), and the ease of detection for the chosen technology (technical limitations).},

Engagement in iterative design activities with clinicians over the course of two years revealed a strong need for time-based features and mechanisms, including timestamps for tasks based on absolute time and automatic stopclocks measuring time by counting up since task performance. We describe in detail the aspects of temporal awareness central to clinicians' awareness needs and then provide examples of how we addressed these needs through the design of a shared information display. As an outcome of this process, we define four types of time representation techniques to facilitate the design of time-based features: (1) timestamps based on absolute time, (2) timestamps relative to the process start time, (3) time since task performance, and (4) time until the next required task.},

abstract = {Iterative user-centred design has become a standard approach for developing interactive products. This process relies on prototyping and usertesting as early as possible to deliver a positive user experience and ensure that final products align with designers' intentions. The video game industry has benefited greatly from this design approach, with games user researchers adapting and introducing various evaluation techniques. However, repeatedly creating game builds suitable for usertesting (i.e., high-fidelity prototypes) is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, recruiting users and conducting evaluation sessions are labour-intensive tasks. These challenges are especially pressing in the evaluation of game level and world design, where designers may wish to evaluate many alternatives or rapidly measure the impact of many small design changes on a game's ability to deliver the intended experience. To support developers grappling with these challenges, we have developed PathOS, a novel tool for simulating testing sessions with agents that model player navigation. This paper reports on our development objectives, implementation, and a user study with professional game developers to assess PathOS' application in a level design context. Our results demonstrate the ability of an automated testing tool to enhance the workflow of practicing developers.},

In this workshop, we want to deepen and expand the discussion on tensions between human and machine autonomy when designing AI systems, focusing on scientific, technological and ethical challenges that it poses.

This paper is about the principles underlying a research project called 'The Little Grey Cat engine' or greyCat. GreyCat has grown out of our experience in using commercial game engines as production environments for the transmission of culture and experience through the telling of individual stories. The key to this endeavour is the potential of the greyCat software to visualize worlds and the manner in which non-formal stories are intertwined with place. The apparently simple dictum of "show, don't tell" and the use of 3D game engines as a medium disguise an interesting nexus of problematic issues and questions, particularly in the ramifications for cultural dimensions and participatory interaction design. The engine is currently in alpha and the following paper is its background story. In this paper we discuss the problematic, thrown into sharp relief by a particular project, and we continue to unpack concepts and early designs behind the greyCat itself.},

Scones is a novel deep-learning-based system that iteratively generates scenes of sketched objects composed with semantic specifications from natural language. Scones exceeds state-of-the-art performance on a text-based scene modification task, and introduces a mask-conditioned sketching model that can generate sketches with poses specified by high-level scene information. In an exploratory user evaluation of Scones, participants reported enjoying an iterative drawing task with Scones, and suggested additional features for further applications. We believe Scones is an early step towards automated, intelligent systems that support human-in-the-loop applications for communicating ideas through sketching in art and design.},

In addition, supporting collaborative development of AI applications across organisations has become a major need in AI system design. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is required to protect intellectual property in such collaboration.

It describes the relationships between DRM and privacy and outlines the threats against these non-functional features. Finally, the paper provides first security architecture to protect against the threats on DRM and privacy in collaborative AI design using AI pipelines.},

abstract = {In this paper I want to look at computing science, its paradigms, its products and processes, from a gender perspective. My claim is that the gender question is not (just) a problem of women not being suitable or interested in higher-level expertise concerning the design of computer programs. Paradigms of computing science - at least in Germany, where the author is rooted - have their origins in gendered perspectives. I want to argue that it is not enough to campaign for more girls and women in the field, but that as computer scientists we must also look at our own discipline in order to consider how we can change its basic ideas and its culture, which make it so difficult for girls and women to become attracted to it. I want to mention some projects conducted by my research group "Digital Media in Education" at the University of Bremen, Germany, where we try to develop software for women and women's projects and to take a more user-friendly look at the processes of software development.},

abstract = {This study is part of a larger project that showed the potential of our mixed reality (MR) system in fostering social initiation behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). We compared it to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools, where both mediated a face-to-face dyadic play session between an ASC child and a non-ASC child. In this study, our first goal is to show that an MR platform can be utilized to alter the nonverbal body behavior between ASC and non-ASC during social interaction as much as a traditional therapy setting (LEGO). A second goal is to show how these body cues differ between ASC and non-ASC children during social initiation in these two platforms. We present our first analysis of the body cues generated under two conditions in a repeated-measures design. Body cue measurements were obtained through skeleton information and characterized in the form of spatio-temporal features from both subjects individually (e.g. distances between joints and velocities of joints), and interpersonally (e.g. proximity and visual focus of attention). We used machine learning techniques to analyze the visual data of eighteen trials of ASC and non-ASC dyads. Our experiments showed that: (i) there were differences between ASC and non-ASC bodily expressions, both at individual and interpersonal level, in LEGO and in the MR system during social initiation; (ii) the number of features indicating differences between ASC and non-ASC in terms of nonverbal behavior during initiation were higher in the MR system as compared to LEGO; and (iii) computational models evaluated with combination of these different features enabled the recognition of social initiation type (ASC or non-ASC) from body features in LEGO and in MR settings. We did not observe significant differences between the evaluated models in terms of performance for LEGO and MR environments. This might be interpreted as the MR system encouraging similar nonverbal behaviors in children, perhaps more similar than the LEGO environment, as the performance scores in the MR setting are lower as compared to the LEGO setting. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of full body interaction and MR settings for children with ASC.},

This paper considers how consumers might relate to these future smart grids within the UK. To address this challenge we exploited a combination of demonstration and animated sketches to convey the nature of a future smart energy infrastructure based on software agents. Users' reactions suggested that although they felt an obligation to engage with energy issues, they were principally disinterested. Users showed a considerable lack of trust in energy companies raising a dilemma of design. While users might welcome agents to help in engaging with complex energy infrastructures, they had little faith in those that might provide them. This suggests the need to consider how to design software agents to enhance trust in these socio-economic settings.},

Language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. Many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. To explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in English, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. Post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. We discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities.},

Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.},

Future scenarios can be used as a method to elicit potential future evolutions of new technologies. In this paper, we suggest a future scenarios technique to identify research and training needs along the introduction of new disruptive technologies in the public sector. The paper describes the methodology of this scenario approach and an exemplification of identifying research and training needs relating to the implementation of Internet of things in public service provisioning, based on the application of the scenario approach. The methodology foresees expert engagement in the interactive workshops aimed at identification and prioritisation of the needs through a moderated discussion of the pre-constructed future scenarios. The methodology proved to be a useful tool for the identification of the research and training needs based on the expert input and produced useful and useable results during its application.},

In our case, a local community suffered from air pollution caused by industrial activity. The residents lacked the technological fluency to gather and curate diverse scientific data to advocate for regulatory change. We collaborated with the community in developing an air quality monitoring system which integrated heterogeneous data over a large spatial and temporal scale. The system afforded strong scientific evidence by using animated smoke images, air quality data, crowdsourced smell reports, and wind data. In our evaluation, we report patterns of sharing smoke images among stakeholders. Our survey study shows that the scientific knowledge provided by the system encourages agonistic discussions with regulators, empowers the community to support policy making, and rebalances the power relationship between stakeholders.},

ARGs are also participatory experiences, because game designers dynamically adjust content in response to players' actions as game play progresses. What if the participatory process was extended during the design phase of an ARG as well? Few, if any, studies have explored how to include player populations in the ARG design process -- especially ARGs that target youth. In this paper, we share the process we followed to design a large-scale ARG to promote scientific inquiry for teenagers (13-17 years old) by partnering with them. Our findings suggest that co-designing with youth resulted in novel design features in the final game, and gave us insight into adolescent attitudes toward various scientific concepts. We also share co-design techniques that were not as effective and offer suggestions for future approaches.},

Here, most use cases focus on serving customer needs autonomously. Frequently, human intervention becomes necessary to support the robot in exceptional situations. However, direct intervention of service operators is often not possible and requires specialized personnel. In a co-design process with 13 service operators from a pharmacy, we designed a remote working environment for human-robot collaboration that enables first-time experiences and collaboration with robots. Five participants took part in an assessment study and reported on their experiences about the utility, usability and user experience. Results show that participants were able to control and train the robot through the remote control environment. We discuss implications of our results for future work in service domains and emphasize a shift of focus from full robot automatization to human-robot collaboration forms.},

abstract = {Perinatal stroke (PS) is a serious condition that, if undetected and thus untreated, often leads to life-long disability, in particular Cerebral Palsy (CP). In clinical settings, Prechtl's General Movement Assessment (GMA) can be used to classify infant movements using a Gestalt approach, identifying infants at high risk of developing PS. Training and maintenance of assessment skills are essential and expensive for the correct use of GMA, yet many practitioners lack these skills, preventing larger-scale screening and leading to significant risks of missing opportunities for early detection and intervention for affected infants. We present an automated approach to GMA, based on body-worn accelerometers and a novel sensor data analysis method--Discriminative Pattern Discovery (DPD)--that is designed to cope with scenarios where only coarse annotations of data are available for model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a study with 34 newborns (21 typically developing infants and 13 PS infants with abnormal movements). Our method is able to correctly recognise the trials with abnormal movements with at least the accuracy that is required by newly trained human annotators (75%), which is encouraging towards our ultimate goal of an automated PS screening system that can be used population-wide.},

However, passive sensing often struggles with noisy data, ambiguous feedback and weak user agency over the device, whilst self-reporting relies on user-entered data which can be time consuming and cognitively demanding. To address these limitations, we explore a different approach, whereby individuals consciously actuate personal data capture and are in control of it at all times; yet, the interaction solely involves clicking a button, thus avoiding cognitive overload whilst supporting immediate reflection. We call this approach intentive computing. Through our initial investigations we found that conscious interactions cannot only provide real-time relief in anxiety management, but can also function as memory anchors irrespective of the content captured and even prior to data visualization.},

Several strategies are available to detect user emotions but it is questionable when identifying the most suitable and compatible strategy which can be used to detect emotions when using mobile devices. Multimodal emotion recognition paves the path to detect emotions by combining two or more strategies in order to identify the most meaningful emotion. Emotion identification through facial expressions and text analytics has given high accuracies but combining them and practically applying them in the context of a mobile environment should be done. Three prototypes were developed using evolutionary prototyping which can detect emotions from facial expressions and text data, using state of the art APIs and SDKs where the base of the prototypes was a keyboard known as "Emotional Keyboard" which is compatible with Android devices. Evaluations of Prototype 1 and 2 have been performed based on participatory design and reviewed the compatibility of emotion identification through facial expressions and text data in the mobile context. Evaluation of Prototype 3 should be done in the future and a confusion matrix should be built to verify the accuracies by cross-checking with training and validation accuracies that have been obtained when developing the neural network.},

We wanted to investigate the extent to which digital marketing professionals would find our system usable and useful and whether or not the advice our system generated would create content that had higher click through rates than content developed without the system's advice. Our framework decomposes aspects of prior campaigns into features including image quality, memorability, and placement; and text readability, formality and sentiment. We show our algorithm has high predictive value on a historical test set (AUC .80); that digital marketing professionals give the system an overall high satisfaction rating and that, using the advice of the AI agent, we can generate content that creates up to 22% click-through rate lift on a 700 A/B preference tasks given to master workers on AMT.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is cumbersome even for expert clinicians owing to the diversity in the symptoms exhibited by the children which depend on the severity of the disorder. Furthermore, the diagnosis is based on the behavioural observations and the developmental history of the child which has substantial dependence on the perspectives and interpretations of the specialists. In this paper, we present a robot-assisted diagnostic system for the assessment of behavioural symptoms in children for providing a reliable diagnosis. The robotic assistant is intended to support the specialist in administering the diagnostic task, perceiving and evaluating the task outcomes as well as the behavioural cues for assessment of symptoms and diagnosing the state of the child. Despite being used widely in education and intervention for children with autism (CWA), the application of robot assistance in diagnosis is less explored. Further, there have been limited studies addressing the acceptance and effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions for CWA in the Global South. We aim to develop a robot-assisted diagnostic framework for CWA to support the experts and study the viability of such a system in the Indian context.},

Yet from an end-user perspective, we already live in an era of seemingly sentient agents. Virtual personal assistants are now ubiquitous on mobile and smart home devices. But as long as human-level artificial intelligence remains speculative, the ability of today's pseudo-sentient agents to understand and fulfill the full range of human user demands is, by definition, limited and failure-prone. We need better strategies for designing natural, graceful, failure-tolerant user experiences with pseudo-sentient agents. To better support researchers and practitioners actively working on this problem, we propose a Special Interest Group at CHI 2020: a pop-up studio to design the near-future of user interactions with pseudo-sentient agents.},

While the body of research on smart domestic environments includes a wealth of human-centered research, the use of CDR is marginal. Our work demonstrates how such a process engages residents in activities to imagine why people might value smart domestic environments and how they might want to interact with them. Through goal setting activities, paper prototyping, and field-testing of resident designed technology probes, we present use cases, design principles and experiential insights. After sharing these findings, we introduce the emergence of smart domestic environments as possessing persuasive, personified and artful qualities.},

How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way? As one answer to this question, we present WeBuildAI, a collective participatory framework that enables people to build algorithmic policy for their communities. The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

abstract = {Real-time collaboration between a requester and crowd workers expands the scope of tasks that crowdsourcing can be used for by letting requesters and crowd workers interactively create various artifacts (e.g., a sketch prototype, writing, or program code). In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups. Finally, we make design recommendations that can inform the design of future real-time collaboration processes in crowdsourcing systems.},

Our RoboTIPS study sets out to design and trial an innovative design feature that will advance the safe operation of social robots and foster societal trust. The Ethical Black Box (EBB) collects data about a robot's actions in real time and in context; when an incident occurs, this data can be used within a wider investigation process to determine what went wrong and prevent similar adverse events. In this paper we draw on Lucy Suchman's groundbreaking work on human-machine relationships to elucidate the goals, practices and potential impact of our study. We align with Suchman's positioning of safety as an accomplishment of situated action and draw on her analysis to describe the actions of the EBB-enhanced social robot as contingent on context and the robot's status as a social agent. We also describe shared priorities in our methodological approaches. We close with observations on how participatory design and an ethnomethodologically-informed stance towards data collection and analysis can contribute to the field of responsible innovation (RI), which seeks to ensure that innovations are undertaken in the public interest and provide societal value.},

Until now, the evaluation of information visualizations was often restricted to measuring outcomes only (time and error) or insights into the data set. A more detailed look into the processes which lead to or hinder task completion is provided by analyzing users' problem solving strategies. A study illustrates how they can be assessed and how this knowledge can be used in participatory design to improve a visual analytics tool. In order to provide the users a tool which functions as a real scaffold, it should allow them to choose their own path to Rome. We discuss how evaluation of problem solving strategies can shed more light on the users' "exploratory minds".},

PbD can be carried out in different ways, for instance, by kinesthetic guidance, teleoperation or by using external controls. In this paper, we compare these three ways of controlling a robot in terms of efficiency, effectiveness (success and error rate) and usability. In an industrial assembly scenario, 51 participants carried out peg-in-hole tasks using one of the three control modalities. The results show that kinesthetic guidance produces the best results. In order to test whether the problems during teleoperation are due to the fact that users cannot, like in kinesthetic guidance, switch between control points using traditional teleoperation devices, we designed a new device that allows users to switch between controls for large and small movements. A user study with 15 participants shows that the novel teleoperation device yields almost as good results as kinesthetic guidance.},

In consequences, time taken by developers to code from requirements captured by business analysts is longer than visual representation produced by UX or UI designers, which shortens the requirement gathering process. In conclusion, we found that UX sketching that produces visual representation of user needs to be effective especially in participatory design approach and to reduce user frustrations.},

In this paper, we explore in particular how information about a person's emotions can be communicated to the agent with means of non-verbal communication through tangible interfaces. The purpose is to explore how different individuals approach the task of designing their own tangible interfaces for communicating emotions with a digital companion, and the range of different preferences and expectations. Six participants were interviewed and created tangible prototypes during a co-creation workshop. The data was analysed using theories about human emotions and activity, and translated into a generic user model, an architecture for a multiagent system and interface design proposals. The results include increased understanding of how different individuals would like to express their emotions with tangible interfaces, and informed the design of the information models regarding representing emotions. The study illuminated the importance of personalisation of functionality and interface design to address the diversity among individuals, as well as the design of the adaptive behaviour of a digital companion. Future work includes further studies involving additional participants, the development of the stress management application and conducting user studies where prototypes are used in daily activities.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, civil litigants in the U.S. have come to increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) systems to classify documents for discovery review and fact-finding, an approach now broadly referred to as Technology-Assisted Review (TAR). The transformation of legal discovery from a painstaking manual process to a sophisticated algorithm-driven methodology took place over a relatively short period of time, many years before controversies arose surrounding the use of automated risk assessment tools on the criminal side of the U.S. justice system. Introduced in 2008 to a handful of litigators in an experimental research setting hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), TAR was first deployed live on an active litigation in 2012, and by 2015 a vocal and influential vanguard of judges was actively advocating for its use on cases involving large, complex document discovery. My research examines the cross-disciplinary experimentation and collaboration that took place across legal practitioners and computer scientists leading to ML becoming a judicially accepted solution in U.S. civil litigation practice. The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive case study for how an expert professional field wrestled with the challenges of integrating ML into sensitive decision-making workflows. While deeply attentive to the unique and complex encounter between U.S. civil litigation practice and computer science, my work also aims to inform the practice of algorithmic system design, development, and governance across other high-stakes professional domains.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. This skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. For example, Kay et al. showed that although 28% of CEOs in the U.S. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for "CEO" in Google Image Search are women. Similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. Most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. These labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. As observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. We develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. It accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this "diversity score" into the final selection process. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 Google Image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known CelebA dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as "smiling" or "glasses". Both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current Google Image Search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. Further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. These empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.},

abstract = {Menopause is a natural part of women's aging, but is often accompanied by an increased cardiometabolic risk (CMR), of which most women are unaware. Preventive self-care via mobile health applications (apps) is a promising way to address this issue, but research on apps for middle-aged women is limited. Further, modeling such risk is no trivial task in a non-clinical self-care context, where most biomarkers used in traditional models are unavailable. Machine learning (ML) is a potential option in this regard, but many ML approaches are effectively black box models, which leads to doubt regarding their trustworthiness. Therefore, in this paper we analyze and compare different decision tree and rule-based classification models, considered to be inherently interpretable, to assess the CMR of early middle-aged women in the context of a non-clinical self-care app. For this, we first defined a set of candidate determinants based on the feedback of potential users and domain experts. We then used data from a subset of the participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to compare these ML models with traditional risk score models, based on five cardiometabolic 10-year outcomes: heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.},

Our research group at Fraunhofer FIT looks back on a 51 year long research tradition that started with Engelbart’s vision and followed through the larger developments of HCI from the introduction of CSCW up to successful projects involving the engineering of large software systems in practice. In this paper, we outline the history of our institute against the background of trends in HCI, working out the cornerstones and “useful practices” from our research tradition towards our vision of the future of a human-centred AI/IA, with the expectation that this analysis may be useful for similar organisations. In doing so, we illustrate tensions between theory and application, humans and technology, and show how keeping those aspects in balance is an important challenge and chance for bringing disruptive emerging technologies successfully into practice.},

Although it is considered paranormal activity, the way it works rests on ideomotor actions and we argue that the Ouija is a resource for design for the following aspects: It is a 1) collective tangible exploration tool operated by two or more people through a physical pointer that moves, seemingly on its own, around the letters to probe meanings by composing messages. It has been used by artists as a medium offering 2) creative stimulation to generate material and develop ideas for their work. The Ouija also enables people to express nonconscious knowledge, as research suggests, and thus can provide 3) access to tacit dimension. In this paper, we present the Otherworld Framework that describes its principal elements and provide speculations on how to exploit them in design for collaborative, engaging and unconventional group interactions.},

Flavor-based cues were then created for each memory through a co-design process. Findings indicate the dominance of relationship themes in the identified self-defining memories and that flavor-based cues related mostly to multiple ingredient dishes. We discuss how these findings can support further research and design into flavor-based memory cues through 3D food printing.},

The key focus of these dashboards is to support better human sense-making and decision-making by visualising data about learners to a variety of stakeholders. Early research on learning analytics dashboards focused on the use of visualisation and prediction techniques and demonstrates the rich potential of dashboards in a variety of learning settings. Present research increasingly uses participatory design methods to tailor dashboards to the needs of stakeholders, employs multimodal data acquisition techniques, and starts to research theoretical underpinnings of dashboards. In this paper, we present these past and present research efforts as well as the results of the VISLA19 workshop on "Visual approaches to Learning Analytics" that was held at LAK19 with experts in the domain to identify and articulate common practices and challenges for the domain. Based on an analysis of the results, we present a research agenda to help shape the future of learning analytics dashboards.},

A participatory design approach was followed in the development of the integrated system to ensure that the expectations of visually challenged people are met. Given that India is a multilingual country (22 official languages), a uniform framework for an integrated text-to-speech synthesis systems with screen readers across six Indian languages are developed, which can be easily extended to other languages as well. Since Indian languages are syllable centred, syllable-based concatenative speech synthesizers are built.This paper describes the development and evaluation of syllable-based Indian language Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system (around festival TTS) with ORCA and NVDA, for Linux and Windows environments respectively. TTS systems for six Indian Languages, namely, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Telugu were built. Usability studies of the screen readers were performed. The system usability was evaluated by a group of visually challenged people based on a questionnaire provided to them. And a Mean Opinion Score(MoS) of 62.27% was achieved.},

Using the manipulatives, children can solve problems that situate math operations or concepts in specific everyday contexts. Informed by four participatory design sessions with teachers and children, we developed five ARMath modules to support basic arithmetic and 2D geometry. We also conducted an exploratory evaluation of ARMath with 27 children (ages 5-8) at a local children's museum. Our findings demonstrate how ARMath engages children in math learning, how failures in AI can be used as learning opportunities, and challenges that children face when using ARMath.},

abstract = {Many researchers have started to explore natural interaction scenarios for children. No matter if these children are normally developing or have special needs, evaluating Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) is a challenge. To find methods that work well and provide reliable data is difficult, for example because commonly used methods such as questionnaires donot work well particularly with younger children. Previous research has shown that children need support in expressing how they feel about technology. Given this, researchers often choose time-consuming behavioral measures from observations to evaluate CRI. However, these are not necessarily comparable between studies and robots.This workshop aims to bring together researchers from differentdisciplines to share their experiences on these aspects. The main topics are methods to evaluate child-robot interaction design, methods to evaluate socially assistive child-robot interaction and multi-modal evaluation of child-robot interaction.Connected questions that we would like to tackle are for example: i) What are reliable metrics in CRI' ii) How can we overcome the pitfalls of survey methods in CRI' iii) How can we integrate qualitative approaches in CRI' iv) What are the best practices for in the wild studies with children? Looking across disciplinary boundaries, we want to discuss advantages and short-comings of using different evaluation methods in order to compile guidelines for future CRI research.

However, this method does not always include the domain experts throughout the entire development process. This paper presents a Co-design framework as a structured methodology for ontology design and development. The framework, known as the Co-Designing Ontologies Methodology (C-DOM), presents a strategy to draw knowledge from the Subject Matter Expert (SME) without the SME needing to know any-thing about how to create an ontology. The C-DOM framework outlines a series of workshops that align to the layers of the Semantic Technologies architecture and has been developed via an iterative design process and tested in different domains with different levels of complexity and purpose. The first iteration focused on the creation of a light-weight ontology to link generic data in the incident and accident. The next iteration built a heavyweight ontology that included complex inference and reasoning within the urban water management domain. This paper describes the C-DOM in detail for re-use within the Semantic Technologies community and outlines its iterative development process undertake.1},

Substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. We present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. A participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. We then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. We also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.},

We investigate this question in the context of video games with non-player characters (NPCs), because the rapid expansion of the game industry makes NPCs one of the most common ways in which we experience AI agents. We seek to understand whether players benefit mentally by giving gifts to NPCs in video games. We intend to observe the behaviour of players and measure their psychological changes through a specially designed video game providing them with mechanisms for gifting to NPCs. We have taken an understanding of gifting from the real world and applied this understanding within a game. The game development has been an iterative process of design-build-playtest. Such a process helps us better understand the research space and to better describe the questions.

abstract = {Several studies have highlighted the absence of an integrated comprehensive dataset covering all of the UK’s museums, hence impeding research into the emergence, evolution, and wider impact of the UK’s museums sector. “Mapping Museums” is an interdisciplinary project aiming to develop a comprehensive database of UK museums in existence since 1960, and to use this to undertake an evidence-based analysis of the development of the UK’s museum sector during 1960--2020 and the links to wider cultural, social, and political concerns. A major part of the project has been the iterative, participatory design of a new RDF/S Knowledge Base to store data and metadata relating to the UK’s museums, and a Web Application for the project’s humanities scholars to browse, search, and visualise the data to investigate their research questions. This article presents the challenges we faced in developing the Knowledge Base and Web Application, our methodology and methods, the design and implementation of the system, and the design, outcomes, and implications of a user trial undertaken with a group of experts from the UK’s museums sector.},

abstract = {The advancement of artificial intelligence and wearable computing triggers the radical innovation of cognitive applications. In this work, we propose VIMES, an augmented reality-based memory assistance system that helps recall declarative memory, such as whom the user meets and what they chat. Through a collaborative method with 20 participants, we design VIMES, a system that runs on smartglasses, takes the first-person audio and video as input, and extracts personal profiles and event information to display on the embedded display or a smartphone. We perform an extensive evaluation with 50 participants to show the effectiveness of VIMES for memory recall. VIMES outperforms (90% memory accuracy) other traditional methods such as self-recall (34%) while offering the best memory experience (Vividness, Coherence, and Visual Perspective all score over 4/5). The user study results show that most participants find VIMES useful (3.75/5) and easy to use (3.46/5).},

At the same time, they can be abused to engage in cyberbullying, which can cause significant psychological harm to those affected. Thus, with the growth in multimodal communication platforms, there is an urgent need to devise multimodal methods for cyberbullying detection and prevention. However, there are no existing approaches that use automated audio and video analysis to complement textual analysis. Based on the analysis of a human-labeled cyberbullying data-set of Vine "media sessions' (six-second videos, with audio, and corresponding text comments), we report that: 1) multiple audio and visual features are significantly associated with the occurrence of cyberbullying, and 2) audio and video features complement textual features for more accurate and earlier cyberbullying detection. These results pave the way for more effective cyberbullying detection in emerging multimodal (audio, visual, virtual reality) social interaction spaces.},

Our first aim is to identify the common vision skills needed for both scenarios. To do so, we analyze the need for four vision skills--object recognition, text recognition, color recognition, and counting--on over 27,000 visual questions from two datasets representing both scenarios. We next quantify the difficulty of these skills for both humans and computers on both datasets. Finally, we propose a novel task of predicting what vision skills are needed to answer a question about an image. Our results reveal (mis)matches between aims of real users of such services and the focus of the AI community. We conclude with a discussion about future directions for addressing the visual question answering task.},

abstract = {The field of Predictive Analytics (PA) provides the possibility to utilize large amounts of data to improve forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and competitive advantage. Especially the transport logistics sector, which is characterized by high business-related uncertainties, time-sensitivity, and volatility, highly benefits from accurate resource and production planning. While success factors and framework conditions of applying PA are well-investigated on a theoretical SCM level, findings on internal and external challenges of transport logistics organizations remain scarce. Therefore, based on a multiple case approach, this study offers in-depth insights into six real-world cases of freight forwarders, ocean carriers, and air carriers. The results uncover both internal and external challenges. From the internal perspective, the biggest challenges are related to the technical implementation including the acquisition of globally generated, internal and external data and its harmonization. In addition, stakeholder management and target setting impede the development of PA. Regarding external challenges, relational and external conditions hamper the application. Therefore, especially actions of third-party institutions in terms of standardization and security enhancements are required. This study contributes to the existing literature in various ways as the systematic identification addresses real-world issues of PA in the neglected but crucial area of transport logistics, discussing urgent research needs and highlighting potential solutions. Additionally, the results offer valuable guidance for managers when implementing PA in transport logistics.},

abstract = {Patient safety errors account for over 400,000 preventable deaths annually in US in hospitals alone, 70% of which are caused by team communication breakdowns, stemming from hierarchical structures and asymmetrical power dynamics between physicians, nurses, patients, and others. Nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and prevent these errors, but they are often penalized for speaking up, particularly when physicians are responsible. Nevertheless, empowering nurses and building strong interdisciplinary teams can lead to improved patient safety and outcomes. Thus, our group has been developing a series of intelligent systems that support teaming in safety critical settings, Robot-Centric Team Support System (RoboTSS), and recently developed a group detection and tracking system for collaborative robots. In this paper, we explore how RoboTSS can be used to empower nurses in interprofessional team settings, through a three month long, collaborative design process with nurses across five US-based hospitals. The main findings and contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we found that participants envisioned using a robotic crash cart to guide resuscitation procedures to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Second, nurses discussed how RoboTSS can generate choreography for efficient spatial reconfigurations in co-located clinical teams, which is particularly important in time-sensitive situations such as resuscitation. Third, we found that nurses want to use RoboTSS to "stop the line," and disrupt power dynamics by policing unsafe physician behavior, such as avoiding safety protocols using a robotic crash cart. Fourth, nurses envisioned using our system to support real-time error identification, such as breaking the sterile field, and then communicating those errors to physicians, to relieve them of responsibility. Finally, based on our findings, we propose robot design implications that capture how nurses envision utilizing RoboTSS. We hope this work promotes further exploration in how to design technology to challenge authority in asymmetrical power relationships, particularly in healthcare, as strong teams save lives.},

We claim that the study of social computation suggests a re-interpretation of many traditional AI endeavours, has huge potential application benefits, and presents the field of multiagent systems with novel, exciting research questions. We introduce an abstract model of social computation that helps capture some of its core research problems more precisely. We explore the potential contribution of multiagent systems technologies to the solution of these problems by exposing the close relationship between social computation and existing methods in multiagent systems. We describe how these methods could be reused in this novel application context, what methodological implications this has, and argue that the resulting cross-fertilisation will be highly beneficial for both sides.},

By applying computer vision algorithms to video traces, I developed a mixed-initiative system called PIXELDUST, which allows the researcher to train a system to recognize different objects on a screen. My preliminary results demonstrate the versatility of the approach; for ex- ample, the system can recognize return statements, method signatures, tool tips, and dialog boxes.},

And YOLOv3 is one of the most popular algorithms in the field of object detection owing to its high performance and efficiency. However, the conventional YOLOv3 algorithm is still too heavy to deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. Consequently, this paper proposes a method to improve the YOLOv3 thus it can be easily deployed to embedded platforms without losing performance. First, substitutes the backbone of YOLOv3, i.e. Darknet53 for MobileNet, which has been proven to be a very efficiency framework for lightweight network. Second, there are numerous redundancies in the detection heads of YOLOv3 and will take a lot of time in the inference process, so we prune the detection heads to a dead-simple structure. Various experiments on our own Power Transmission Line datasets verify our method has state-of-the-art performance while can meet the requirements for deployment to the mobile platforms.},

This entails a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across these different systems. Semantic interoperability of product information refers to enabling the exchange of design intelligence, including construction history, parameters, features, and constraints. This is a crucial difference compared to current standards such as STEP that deliver "dumb" geometry, where no design intent is associated. To enable semantics data exchange, we propose an ontology-based approach, consisting in developing a "Common Design Features Ontology", called CDFO. Interoperability among ontologies is fulfilled by defining several mapping rules. We use a descriptive logic-based language, notably OWL DL to represent formally our ontology.},

When these tools are software engineering tools, we can assume that their users have formal training in computing. However, when the tools are for designing art or multimedia objects, the artists using the tools typically don't have much background in the computing technology they are using. While interdisciplinary design teams can work around the shortcomings of individual team members, they might be more effective teams if they shared a common language and understanding of certain key aspects of the design process. At the University of Washington we have begun a project to study the use of the theory of problem solving as shared knowledge by design teams engaged in creating of multimedia games. The theory we used is derived from early work in artificial intelligence. The concepts of state space, search, operators and evaluation functions are key components of the shared knowledge. The theory is embodied in a software system called T-STAR (Transparent STate-spaces search ARchitecture) which supports a collaborative interface for problem-solving. A key question for the project is "to what extent will interdisciplinary design teams adopt and exploit the theory of problem solving when given an opportunity to do so?"},

abstract = {It has been argued that people are more inclined to accept a robot in their daily lives and even their home, if they have the feeling that the robot's behavior and interaction style matches their characteristics, needs and abilities. The concept of personalization has been introduced in order to create such personal, tailored human-robot interactions (HRI). Personalizing HRI means that robot takes into account individual user characteristics and can adjust its behavior to the situation and the human interaction partner. Previous HRI research indicates that personalization can have positive effects on the user experience during HRI as well as the user's attitudes towards and perceptions of the robot. This workshop is aimed at discussing the value of and exchanging ideas about the concept of personalization for HRI design. More concretely, we want to explore tools, methods and processes for appropriate robot behavior design and interaction modelling for personalized HRI. The workshop uses interactive, creative activities inspired by design thinking and participatory design to promote collaboration and co-creation between the participants and to inspire new, innovative perspectives on personalized HRI.},

Pneuxels (Pneumatic Pixels) are pneumatically actuated pixels, connected through a web-socket platform, that change their physical state based on input from other Pneuxels, from the environment, or from users.

abstract = {In this paper two participatory design activities are described in which teenagers create lo-fi designs describing emotions and explain the rationale for their design choices. Designs annotating and describing emotions are categorised as anthropomorphic, abstract, object based, or biomorphic. The paper concludes that teenagers use a variety of visual metaphors to describe emotions, that teenagers use anthropomorphic visual metaphors the most to describe emotions and that teenagers make more use of abstract and biomorphic visual metaphors to describe 'negative' emotions. The effect of materials on designs is analysed, suggesting that teenagers are more likely to create designs describing emotions featuring anthropomorphic visual metaphors when using malleable three-dimensional materials. Suggestions are made for the use of externalisation and personification as part of interactive emotion displays within affective systems. This research will be of value to interaction designers and Child Computer Interaction researchers seeking to understand how teenagers use different visual metaphors to describe different emotions. The contribution of this work is a categorisation of the visual metaphors teenagers use to express different emotions.},

However, the IoT revolution comes along with other so-called disruptive technologies. Making sense of the data gathered through sensors comes along with discussions of AI, Big Data, Machine Learning and other such technological advancements. While a number of projects already address current challenges of exploiting such technological advancements in digital government, the full scope of deploying the disruptive technologies in smart city initiatives requires more research. This paper therefore aims at investigating research needs in successfully implementing and deploying disruptive technologies in smart cities. The paper first analyses existing EU-funded projects concerning the research needs these projects address and/or put forward. Subsequently, a future scenario is developed to demonstrate the potentials of using disruptive technologies in smart cities. Finally, nine research needs (technical and nontechnical) derived from the comparison of existing research needs from the projects and from the future scenario.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9781538685556},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {This paper presents a gesture set for communicating states to novice users from a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) through an elicitation study comparing gestures created by participants recruited from the general public with varying levels of experience with an sUAS. Previous work in sUAS flight paths sought to communicate intent, destination, or emotion without focusing on concrete states such as Low Battery or Landing. This elicitation study uses a participatory design approach from human-computer interaction to understand how novice users would expect an sUAS to communicate states, and ultimately suggests flight paths and characteristics to indicate those states. We asked users from the general public (N=20) to create gestures for seven distinct sUAS states to provide insights for human-drone interactions and to present intuitive flight paths and characteristics with the expectation that the sUAS would have general commercial application for inexperienced users. The results indicate relatively strong agreement scores for three sUAS states: Landing (0.455), Area of Interest (0.265), and Low Battery (0.245). The other four states have lower agreement scores, however even they show some consensus for all seven states. The agreement scores and the associated gestures suggest guidance for engineers to develop a common set of flight paths and characteristics for an sUAS to communicate states to novice users.},

In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users' preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants, 3,625 referents, and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.

It draws on sociological accounts of representation and translation to examine one particular case: the application of topic modeling to blogs written by parents of children on the autism spectrum. In doing so, the paper illustrates the kinds of statements that topic models, and other computational techniques, can make on behalf of people. It also articulates some of the potential consequences of such statements. The paper concludes by offering several suggestions about how to address potential harms that can occur when computational models speak on behalf of someone.},

abstract = {Previous work in 3D printing of hand orthotic devices has shown that patients prefer a 3D-printed design over traditional orthotic splints. Despite the possibility to incorporate self-expression when designing for 3D printing, further customization post-printing is not possible. This creates a design iteration process that may require multiple 3D-printed customized orthosis to obtain the final product. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are unique materials for design due to their "origami" nature; that is, their ability to bend when heated. This paper looks at how to harness this ability to create what we propose as Orthorigami: orthotics made using folding techniques. Specifically, the paper explores how to design an aesthetically pleasing, lightweight, simple, easily adjustable, personally customizable Orthorigami device. This paper presents three design cases using Orthorigami. These cases are used as a means to explore the design process of Orthorigami and see if the process provides an improvement on design iteration over its 3D-printed counterparts. The outcome of case studies is used to propose a process that the end-user may use to create a tailored Orthorigami device in a DIY setting.},

Our objects and training protocol are adaptable components within a computer vision based interactive system that captures and analyzes stroke survivors completing rehabilitation activities.

abstract = {Geometrical thinking is a life-long skill, yet, despite its importance, geometry teaching and learning is fraught with difficulties. Traditional pen and pencil approaches have failed to address them. In this vein, a conceptual instructional design (ID), namely GeoArt-ID, is proposed as a radically novel, holistic approach to develop geometrical thinking using art as a source for inspiring activity content for learning geometry. The dynamic design of GeoArt-ID is based upon a framework where the synergy of multiple knowledge, i.e., Technological, Didactical, Content (TDCK) knowledge is involved. GeoArt-ID is set within an affective (a-), blended (b-) and collaborative (c-) learning environment, introducing unique quantitative metrics to express the evolution of the learner's geometrical thinking. oese metrics could be derived from the analysis of a collection of a large amount of sensorial biosignals (big data) captured via unobtrusive smart sensors during sensorimotor learning activities. Data-to-knowledge representation, considering the domains of emotion, cognitive, body gesture and geometric tasks, could be achieved via advanced signal processing and machine/deep learning. Consequently, GeoArt-ID can exhibit high adaptability, scaffolding mentally disabled students to perform geometrical thinking and reasoning for all.},

After presenting the results of a participatory design workshop and a survey of professional designers, we introduce SemanticCollage, a digital mood board tool that attaches semantic labels to images by applying a state-of-the-art semantic labeling algorithm. SemanticCollage helps designers to 1) translate vague, visual ideas into search terms; 2) make better sense of and communicate their designs; while 3) not disrupting their creative flow. A structured observation with 12 professional designers demonstrated how semantic labels help designers successfully guide image search and find relevant words that articulate their abstract, visual ideas.

abstract = {While recent attempts to search a conceptual software engineering design search space with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have yielded promising results, the practical application of such search-based techniques remains to be addressed. This paper reports initial findings of the application of software agents in support of an interactive, user-centered conceptual software design scenario. The supporting role of a number of single responsibility agents is described and results for a case study indicate that the application of such agents to search-based design scenarios provides efficient, high performance and effective support. The notion of interactive, joint human-computer activity appears to map well to conceptual software design scenarios: focus on superior design concepts and thence to useful and interesting designs provides a natural and effective way of narrowing the population based search. In addition, agents and the human designer appear to interact as cooperative "team players", jointly influencing the evolutionary algorithm based search. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including expanding the scale of implementation of underlying technologies to support distributed, collaborative design.},

abstract = {Autonomous virtual agents (VAs) are increasingly used commercially in critical information spaces such as healthcare. Existing VA research has focused on microscale interaction patterns such as usability and artificial intelligence. However, the macroscale patterns of users' information practices and their relationship with the design and adoption of VAs have been largely understudied, especially when it comes to older adults (OAs), who stand to benefit greatly from VAs. We conducted a preliminary investigation to understand the role design elements, such as anthropomorphic aspects of VAs, play in OAs' perception of VAs and in OAs' preferences for VAs' participation within their health information practices. Some unexpected findings indicate that the fidelity of anthropomorphic features influences perception in ways that are dependent on the context of the information tasks. This suggests that research on improving the design and increasing the adoption of VAs should factor the interplay between fidelity of VA representation and information context.},

We describe the iterative design process used to create the Framework, as well as three novel prototypes designed to increase social connectedness and social presence in high-latency situations: 1) the InSync app that allows partners to perform activities simultaneously even though they only see proof of their synchronicity later; 2) the After the Beep system that lets users leave IoT messages that are triggered by the recipients; and 3) the Surrogate platform where players play group battle games against "surrogate" artificial intelligence avatars that mimic unavailable individuals. Data from two design workshops validates the usefulness of the framework for generating new solutions to high-latency scenarios.},

The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability---individual rights and systemic governance--- and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.},

We propose boundary conditions to denote such conditions. We explore this issue through interviews with eight participants in a large ongoing health IT project. The aim of the project is to implement a shared electronic health record system for health care services in a region of Norway. Four phenomena are discussed—group discontinuity, informal follow-up meetings, contractual discussions in the participatory activity, and the “parking” of design decisions. For each phenomenon, we reflect on the associated boundary conditions and their effects on participation and user impact. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made to help participatory design scale with the complexities of large-scale projects: (1) make the boundary conditions explicit; (2) plan for reflections on the process; and (3) plan for peer interaction between users.},

abstract = {When a new product is delivered, it seldom meets all customer needs. The mature phase of a product is driven by customer needs. It requires a human-centered development cycle. As a result, the company should be able to listen the voice of its customers. Most industrial companies are driven by engineers and by technology itself. If current technology is to serve all actors of the life cycle of a product, related companies need to change their ways of dealing with maturity. They have to stop being so driven by features and start examining what customers actually do. The concept of customer itself has to be revisited to the point that any person or group who deals with a product (coming from a process) is a customer of those who developed the product. Product maturity and process maturity are usually distinguished. Product maturity is related to end-user satisfaction, i.e., customers. Product maturity deals with user experience. Process maturity is related to designers, developers, maintainers and other actors who have an impact on the making and evolution of the product. Process maturity deals with organizations, communities and teams involved in the production of a product. This paper proposes an integrated approach to product and process maturity that involves the use of active design documents to support the description of what the product is, how it is or should be used, why it is designed the way it is and how much it will cost to customers in terms of performance, safety, comfort and other criteria that may be relevant to the product purpose of use.},

However, the information-seeking process can be exhausting, cumbersome and even confusing for migrants as they must cope with time-consuming information overload while searching desired information from lists of documents. Chatbots are easy-to-use, natural, and intuitive, and thus could support information-seeking. There is a lack of research that engages and empowers migrants and other stakeholders as co-design participants in chatbot development. We explored how migrants can be empowered in designing a chatbot that supports their social integration. Using a co-design approach, we conducted a series of activities with migrants and other stakeholders (i.e., online questionnaires, empathy probes, surveys, and co-design workshops) to first understand their expectations regarding chatbots, and then co-design a personality-driven chatbot. We found that chatbot personality can drive co-designing a chatbot as design goals, design directions, and design criteria.},

The system automatically extracts events from the raw text, formalized as a sequence of temporally ordered predicate-arguments.

The results of the machine-learner and the extracted events are then used to generate fine-grained advice for the students.},

abstract = {Computer games are a rich subject for computer science instruction. Unlike many traditional topics in computer science, gaming is inherently interdisciplinary. Developing games requires integration of concepts from computer graphics, artificial intelligence, operating systems, physical simulation, and, for multi-player games, networking and distributed systems. Consequently, a course in computer games offers an opportunity to survey a broad number of subjects in Computer Science while still maintaining a coherent focus on a single subject. In addition to this unique perspective on Computer Science, computer game development is also a topic of great interest to students. In the following I describe a curriculum for a course which surveys Computer Science through the perspective of computer games. This course has been successfully used for two different courses at different institutions. Over the course of this curriculum, students construct a fully functional game. As topics in computer science are covered, functionality related to those topics is implemented in the game. This incremental development provides students with an integrated view of what are traditionally disparate topics in Computer Science.},

abstract = {Motivation -- With collaborative interaction design, formal models have to be used by expert stakeholders in order to work effectively and efficiently. But these formal models should not be discussed with non-expert stakeholders. Therefore, we use non-formal methods which are based on our formal models when we talk to non-expert stakeholders.Research approach --Expert stakeholders have to get a common ground for their discussions. To achieve that common ground, expert stakeholders have to use models, which formalize an interaction they want to design. We develop non-formal methods based on a conceptual model that are easy to apply by non-experts. This way, non-expert stakeholders can allow free play to their thoughts and do not have to adopt formal entities and models. Therefore, the expert can easily interpret the information received from non-expert stakeholders by using the underlying conceptual model.Findings/Design -- Early collaboration with non-expert stakeholders in order to design interaction in a user centered way is important and performed best with a formal model for expert stakeholders and non-formal methods based on these formal models for discussions between expert and non-expert stakeholders.Actually, formal modelling is crucial from our point of view, but we experienced that insisting on it when collaborating with non-experts, leads to insufficient results.Take away message -- Without having formal models in mind, non-formal methods cannot be applied effectively for a collaborative design of interactions. Non-formal methods like an open requirements elicitation in form of workshops or interviews may fail gaining all necessary information if there is no formal model which builds the basis for the non-formal methods. Only with formal models, we are able to plan, lead, and analyze non-formal methods in a way to get optimal results.},

The current design provides extra affordances via folding, flipping, and elastic pulling actions on a multi-display smartwatch. To motivate the design of WristOrigami, we developed a taxonomy that could be useful for analyzing and characterizing the origami-inspired multi-display smartwatch interaction. Through a participatory-design study with a set of prototypes with different levels of fidelity, we investigated users' perception of WristOrigami in a wide range of applications with the presented features, and summarized a list of common shape configurations. We summarized our findings into seven design recommendations, to inform the future design of foldable smartwatch interactions. We further developed a set of application demonstrations as proofs-of-concept.},

We present a longitudinal study that investigates how adolescents with ASD participate as co-designers in an iterative software design process. In this work, we conducted seven co-design workshops with six adolescents with ASD over eight months. The team exchanged ideas and communicated through group discussion and drawings. Our findings suggest that: (1) parents, community group and fellow participants play a pivotal role in supporting a longitudinal ASD co-design study and (2) adolescents with ASD are also able to make better design decision over an iterative software design process. These findings should to be considered when engaging adolescents with ASD as co-designers in a software design process.},

In this paper we describe a traceability framework which consists of a TRAceability Metamodel (TRAM) and a TRAceability Process (TRAP). TRAM provides a language for describing the elements of a traceability process. The TRAceability Process (TRAP) is a process authoring tool for publishing product lifecycle process configurations as a web site for practitioners to access. A key component of the traceability process is the introduction of traceability patterns which provide a standardized mechanism for the visualization and communication of reusable traceability practices.A tool environment supporting the traceability framework is described. The TRAceability Pattern Environment (TRAPEd) is an environment for the structured and collaborative design of a traceability metamodel, process and patterns. Finally we represent the traceability metamodel, process and patterns using Topic Maps (ISO 13250)},

IUI is a user interface that uses intelligent technology to reach the communication between humans and machines. The construction of IUI is not easy and requires the knowledge of different methods, techniques and technologies from many domains (such as, HCI, artificial intelligence, ergonomics, software engineering, etc.). In this way, the existence of a process is an important tool for IUI developers. The literature presents design processes and frameworks for user interface, but most of them do not offer any knowledge regarding the methods, techniques, and technologies that can be used to support the activities involved. Thus, this work proposes a development process for IUIs which offers recommendations about methods, techniques, and technologies. We hope that this process will help analysts and designers who work in IUI area.},

However, the ability to actively participate in creative activities involving music performance has so far been difficult for users with complex disabilities.This paper discusses placing a technology probe, using gesture based musical controls, in an existing music technology project for users with complex disabilities (conditions which affect both cognitive and motor abilities of an individual). The focus is on understanding the needs of this user group in a participatory design approach for creative music technologies that allow for tailored accessibility.Outcomes from this research show that many multi-level social interactions surrounding the technology, users, audience, and any third party facilitators exist in the context of 'facilitated performance'. Results suggest that including facilitators in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) could allow for improved accessibility for users with complex disabilities.},

To complement our system, we plan to give the students' community the possibility to contribute to the whole system, not only with ideas (e.g., participatory design and user-driven innovation) and data (e.g., crowdsourcing and crowdsensing) but also with sensors to plug-in into the infrastructure and visualization add-ons to represent the gathered data.},

They are especially popular for computer programming tutorials since videos convey expert narration alongside the dynamic effects of editing and running code. However, these screencast videos simply consist of raw pixels, so there is no way to interact with the code embedded inside of them. To expand the design space of learner interactions with programming videos, we developed Codemotion, a computer vision algorithm that automatically extracts source code and dynamic edits from existing videos. Codemotion segments a video into regions that likely contain code, performs OCR on those segments, recognizes source code, and merges together related code edits into contiguous intervals. We used Codemotion to build a novel video player and then elicited interaction design ideas from potential users by running an elicitation study with 10 students followed by four participatory design workshops with 12 additional students. Participants collectively generated ideas for 28 kinds of interactions such as inline code editing, code-based skimming, pop-up video search, and in-video coding exercises.},

The diagnosis relies on the observation of behavioural symptoms and parent reporting of the developmental history of the child. It requires years of experience and training for identifying these symptoms which could be often misjudged as other mental conditions with similar symptomology. In this work, we propose a robot-assisted diagnostic protocol for the early detection of autism leveraging the onboard sensors of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) and the vast potential of machine learning techniques. The robot assistant's role will be two-fold: (a) supporting the expert in administering the diagnostic procedure and (b) evaluating the behavioural symptoms and reaching a reliable diagnosis. Even though similar studies have been done in the Global North, the challenges posed by the social and cultural diversity of the Indian population is varied and needs to be explored further.},

Whereas Wikipedia currently uses only manual flagging to detect possible bias, our scheme provides a foundation for the automating of bias flagging by improving upon the methodology of annotation schemes in classic sentiment analysis. We also address challenges unique to the task of identifying biased writing within the specific context of Wikipedia's neutrality policy. We perform a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement, which shows that although the agreement scores for intra-sentential tags were relatively low, the agreement scores on the sentence and entry levels were encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively). Based on an analysis of our first implementation of our scheme, we suggest possible improvements to our guidelines, in hope that further rounds of annotation after incorporating them could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of bias within Wikipedia.},

In earlier work, agents need to follow an order of the depth-first traversal of the hypertree to update their belief. Hence, agents need some synchronization with each other and belief updating can only be done in a limited parallel. Especially, belief updating will fail if any communication channels have problems. In this paper, we present an iterative method where multiple agents asynchronously perform belief updating in a complete parallel.

abstract = {This article argues that our intimate entanglement with digital technologies is challenging the foundations of current HCI research and practice. Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

Standardization research on 3D (three-dimensional) model of power transmission and transformation project was carried out, which is conducive to promoting the sharing of massive engineering information and fully exploiting the value of engineering data. In order to achieve reduction of the model volume, advanced modeling methods need to be studied. Therefore, the 3D spatial modeling method was studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of different 3D modeling methods were compared and analyzed. The CSG modeling technology was used based on the actual situation. The power transmission and transformation engineering design model based on CSG modeling technology were build. Combined with the characteristics of substation model, a 3D modeling method for substation was given.},

We investigated how VUIs could support inclusive education, particularly for pupils with visual impairments (VIs). We organised focused discussions with educators at a school, with support staff from local authorities and, through bodystorming, with a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools, and opened a space for educators, sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios, a design space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this space.},

To realize this potential, this paper explores how randomized experiments can support mutually beneficial instructor-researcher collaborations. We developed the Collaborative Dynamic Experimentation (CDE) framework to address two key tensions. To enable researchers to embed experiments in online lessons while maintaining instructors' editorial control, Collaborative experiment authoring is needed. To enable instructors to use data for rapid improvement while maintaining statistically valid data for researchers, we apply an interpretable machine learning algorithm for Dynamic experimentation. We worked with an on-campus instructor to implement a proof-of-concept CDE system to experiment within their online calculus quizzes. The qualitative results from this deployment provided insight into how the CDE framework can facilitate alignment of research and practice.},

We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.},

abstract = {Distributed Virtual Environments (DVEs), such as online games, military simulations, collaborative design, etc., are very popular nowadays. To support large-scale DVEs, a multi-server architecture is usually employed, and the virtual world is partitioned into multiple zones for load distribution. The client assignment problem arises when assigning the participating clients to the servers. Current approaches usually assign clients to servers according to the locations of clients in the virtual world, i.e., clients interacting in the same zone of the virtual world will be assigned to the same server. This approach may degrade the interactivity of DVEs if the network delay from a client to its assigned server is large. In this paper, we formulate the client assignment problem, and propose two algorithms to assign clients to servers in a more efficient way. The proposed algorithms are based on the heuristics developed for the well-known Terminal Assignment problem. Simulation results with the BRITE Internet Topology Generator show that our algorithms are effective in enhancing the interactivity of DVEs.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant source of suffering, disability and societal cost in the US. However, while the ability to detect a person's risk for developing persistent pain is desirable for timely assessment, management, treatment, and reduced health care costs---no objective measure to detect clinical pain intensity exist. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have deployed clinical decision- making and assessment tools to enhance pain risk detection across core social and clinical domains. Yet, risk assessment models are only as "good" as the data they are based on. Thus, ensuring fairness is also a critical component of equitable care in both the short and long term. This paper takes an intersectional and public health approach to AI fairness in the context of pain and invisible disability, suggesting that computational ethnography is a multimodal and participatory real-world data (RWD) methodology that can be used to enhance the curation of intersectional knowledge bases, thereby expanding existing boundaries of AI fairness in terms of inclusiveness and transparency for pain and invisible disability use cases.},

abstract = {Drawing curves in mid-air with fingers is a fundamental task with applications to 3D sketching, geometric modeling, handwriting recognition, and authentication. Mid-air curve input is most commonly accomplished through explicit user input; akin to click-and-drag, the user may use a hand posture (e.g. pinch) or a button-press on an instrumented controller to express the intention to start and stop sketching. In this paper, we present a novel approach to recognize the user's intention to draw or not to draw in a mid-air sketching task without the use of postures or controllers. For every new point recorded in the user's finger trajectory, the idea is to simply classify this point as either hover or stroke. Our work is motivated by a behavioral study that demonstrates the need for such an approach due to the lack of robustness and intuitiveness while using hand postures and instrumented devices. We captured sketch data from users using a haptics device and trained multiple binary classifiers using feature vectors based on the local geometric and motion profile of the trajectory. We present a systematic comparison of these classifiers and discuss the advantages of our approach to spatial curve input applications.},

abstract = {Despite a lack of consensus on the nature of Computing Research Methods (CRM), a growing number of programs are exploring models and content for CRM courses. This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

The uniqueness of each individual with autism and the context of their lives provide interesting design challenges for the successful creation and adoption of technologies for this domain. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to bring together those who study the use of technology by and for individuals with autism, those who design and de-velop new technologies, and those who are curious about getting involved. Areas that this SIG will consider include assistive technologies; tools for data collection and analysis; educational software; virtual reality rehabilitation environments; identifying users; need finding; user-centered collaborative design processes that include individuals who cannot speak or write; and product assessment. This SIG will provide opportunities for participants to join together and share their own pro-jects, design challenges, and lessons learned while fo-cusing on directions for future development. Those with experience and newcomers to the field are both equally encouraged to attend.},

abstract = {Everyday life is increasingly mediated by technology. Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity, especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology, an important, emerging concern is how the self-the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency-plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question, we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of "care of the self," which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design.},

abstract = {Consider a movie studio aiming to produce a set of new movies for summer release: What types of movies it should produce? Who would the movies appeal to? How many movies should it make? Similar issues are encountered by a variety of organizations, e.g., mobile-phone manufacturers and online magazines, who have to create new (non-existent) items to satisfy groups of users with different preferences. In this paper, we present a joint problem formalization of these interrelated issues, and propose generative methods that address these questions simultaneously. Specifically, we leverage on the latent space obtained by training a deep generative model---the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)---via a loss function that incorporates both rating performance and item reconstruction terms. We use a greedy search algorithm that utilize this learned latent space to jointly obtain K plausible new items, and user groups that would find the items appealing. An evaluation of our methods on a synthetic dataset indicates that our approach is able to generate novel items similar to highly-desirable unobserved items. As case studies on real-world data, we applied our method on the MART abstract art and Movielens Tag Genome datasets, which resulted in promising results: small and diverse sets of novel items.},

The main achievement of this trend of research was the development of new programming models that address both the basic features of agenthood (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and social abilities) as well as more advanced, human-like features usually collectively coined in the agent literature as "mental attitudes" (beliefs, desires, intentions, commitments). Agent oriented technologies, engineering of agent systems, agent languages, development tools, and methodologies are an active and emergent research area. The recent challenge is to include agents in real software environments and widely use the agent paradigm in mainstream programming. In this paper we are going to give an overview of the rapidly developing area of software agents including: overview of the agent programming languages, tools and platforms; possible applications of intelligent and mobile software agents; agents in "Smart Environments".},

The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.},

abstract = {A method of organizing the crowd to generate ideas is described. It integrates crowds using evolutionary algorithms. The method increases the creativity of ideas across generations, and it works better than greenfield idea generation. Specifically, a design space of internet-scale idea generation systems is defined, and one instance is tested: a crowd idea generation system that uses combination to improve previous designs. The key process of the system is the following: A crowd generates designs, then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs were compared to the initial designs and to the designs produced by a greenfield idea generation system. The results show that the sequential combination system produced more creative ideas in the last generation and outperformed the greenfield idea generation system. The design space of crowdsourced idea generation developed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied to a wide range of design problems. The work has both pragmatic and theoretical implications: New forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to test existing and emerging theories of coordination and participatory design. Moreover, it may be possible for human designers, organized as a crowd, to codesign with each other and with automated algorithms.},

Special care was brought to make the simulations playable by humans and to favor the apparition of coalitions. Being controlled by humans, the agents of the initial model became completely pro-active and were able to exchange coffee and money and to form coalitions to fulfill the buyer's offers. Coalitions appeared as expected.Besides, during these experiments, we observed the emergence of specialized roles which were not included in the initial model. We implemented a regular multi-agent system based on the initial model to test the distributed system solving improvements brought by the roles that emerged.},

Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

abstract = {A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs. This user centered approach has proved fruitful, but there exists relatively little work examining the intent and values of the roboticists themselves. Furthermore, we know little of how the values of roboticists influence their own designs. Such knowledge could help designers better reflect on whether their designs effectively convey particular ethics to their users. In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids). Roboticists also see robots as testbeds for learning about humans themselves. We advocate a VSD approach for humanoids that goes beyond engineering disciplines and forces values to the forefront of discussion.},

The aim for the work presented in this article is to develop automated methods to tailor the behavior of the assistive technology for the purpose to provide just-in-time, adaptive interventions targeting multiple domains. This requires methods for representing and updating the user model, including goals, preferences, abilities, activity and its situation. We focus the assessment and intervention tasks typically performed by therapists and provide knowledge-based technology for supporting the process. A formative evaluation study was conducted as a part of a participatory action research process, involving two rehabilitation experts, two young individuals and one senior individual as end-user participants, in addition to knowledge engineers. The main contribution of this work is a theory-based method for assessing the individual's goals, preferences, abilities and motives, which is used for building a holistic user model. The user model is continuously updated and functions as the base for tailoring the system's assistive behavior during intervention and follow-up.},

abstract = {Research to date aimed at the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems has largely focused on topics such as identifying failures of current systems and on technical interventions intended to reduce bias in computational processes. Researchers have given less attention to methods that account for the social and political contexts of specific, situated technical systems at their points of use. Co-developing algorithmic accountability interventions in communities supports outcomes that are more likely to address problems in their situated context and re-center power with those most disparately affected by the harms of algorithmic systems. In this paper we report on our experiences using participatory and co-design methods for algorithmic accountability in a project called the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit. The main insights we gleaned from our experiences were: (i) many meaningful interventions toward equitable algorithmic systems are non-technical; (ii) community organizations derive the most value from localized materials as opposed to what is "scalable" beyond a particular policy context; (iii) framing harms around algorithmic bias suggests that more accurate data is the solution, at the risk of missing deeper questions about whether some technologies should be used at all. More broadly, we found that community-based methods are important inroads to addressing algorithmic harms in their situated contexts.},

This process is embodied in the sense that users design directly by moving and interacting using an interactive machine learning method. Two people improvise an interaction based only on their movements, one plays the part of the virtual character the other plays a real person. Their movements are recorded and they label it with metadata that identifies certain actions and responses. This labeled data is then used to train a Gaussian Mixture Model that is able to recognize new actions and generate suitable responses from the virtual character. A small study showed that users do indeed design in a very embodied way using movement directly as a means of thinking through and designing interactions.},

abstract = {The expansion of charging infrastructure and the optimal utilization of existing infrastructure are key influencing factors for the future growth of electric mobility. The main objective of this paper is to present a novel methodology which identifies the necessary stakeholders, processes their contextual information and meets their optimality criteria using a constraint satisfaction strategy. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used for optimally distributing the electric vehicle charging resources in a smart-mobility ecosystem. The algorithm performs context-aware, constrained-optimization such that the on-demand requests of each stakeholder, e.g., vehicle owner as end-user, grid-operator, fleet-operator, charging-station service operator, is fulfilled. In the proposed methodology, the system learns from the surrounding environment until the optimal charging resource allocation strategy within the limitations of the system constraints is reached. We look at the concept of optimality from the perspective of multiple stakeholders who participate in the smart-mobility ecosystem. A simple use case is presented in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential to develop this concept further to enable more complex digital interactions between the actors of a smart-mobility eco-system.},

abstract = {Human movement has historically been approached as a functional component of interaction within human computer interaction. Yet movement is not only functional, it is also highly expressive. In our research, we explore how movement expertise as articulated in Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) can contribute to the design of computational models of movement's expressive qualities as defined in the framework of Laban Efforts. We include experts in LMA in our design process, in order to select a set of suitable multimodal sensors as well as to compute features that closely correlate to the definitions of Efforts in LMA. Evaluation of our model shows that multimodal data combining positional, dynamic and physiological information allows for a better characterization of Laban Efforts. We conclude with implications for design that illustrate how our methodology and our approach to multimodal capture and recognition of Effort qualities can be integrated to design interactive applications.},

abstract = {Digital products and services are commonplace in our personal lives where software and its algorithms provide assistance and amenities. However, interactive systems within industrial settings have yet to catch up with consumer products, especially with regard to the quality of interaction and user experience. With the rise of automation and data exchange on massive scales, the role of human work is challenged and the importance of cooperation emphasized. New concepts of smart factories in which machines and software are doing parts of the work tasks emerge, drastically altering the nature of work in industrial settings from manual labor to increasingly complex tasks. HCI and especially CSCW offer concepts, technical tools and methods to cope with this disruptive shift towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Networked assistive systems, for instance, are capable of individually addressing and satisfying the diverse needs of a heterogeneous workforce. We propose this workshop to discuss new perspectives on HCI and CSCW in industrial contexts with regard to the emerging IIoT. The goal of the workshop is to explore the design space of IIoT applications, its implications on cooperative work and to formulate new research opportunities to current challenges.},

abstract = {Recent developments in robotics demonstrated that bioinspiration and embodiement are powerful tools to achieve robust behavior in presence of little control. In this context morphological design is usually performed by humans, following a set of heuristic principles: in general this can be limiting, both from an engineering and an artificial life perspectives. In this work we thus suggest a different approach, leveraging evolutionary techniques. The case study is the one of improving the locomotion capabilities of an existing bioinspired robot. First, we explore the behavior space of the robot to discover a number of qualitatively different morphology-enabled behaviors, from whose analysis design indications are gained. The suitability of novelty search -- a recent open-ended evolutionary algorithm -- for this intended purpose is demonstrated. Second, we show how it is possible to condense such behaviors into a reconfigurable robot capable of online morphological adaptation (morphosis, morphing). Examples of successful morphing are demonstrated, in which changing just one morphological parameter entails a dramatic change in the behavior: this is promising for a future robot design. The approach here adopted represents a novel computed-aided, bioinspired, design paradigm, merging human and artificial creativity. This may result in interesting implications also for artificial life, having the potential to contribute in exploring underwater locomotion "as-it-could-be".},

abstract = {Agent-based participatory simulations are laboratory experiments designed like agent-based simulations and where humans access the simulation as software agents.This paper describes the outcomes of six experiments lasting up to two hours each, where human players took part in an iterated game derived from the El Farol bar problem. Agents decide synchronously to go to the bar or to stay home and the benefit depends on the bar attendance, with a threshold effect: it is better to stay home if more than 60% of the agents go. Contrasting with the original version of this problem, we allowed agents, and therefore humans, to communicate before they took their decision.The first two experiments allowed us to train participants and to introduce the notion of teams. Teams represented coalitions within the game and positively affected scoring, but they were not part of an obvious solution to the problem and they did not enforce cooperative behavior in the game.Drawing from these experiments, we designed autonomous agents reproducing strategies of the participants. These agents took part in the last four participatory experiments and we observed the formation of coalitions between agents, between humans and between agents and humans.},

abstract = {As spaces for learning about Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) research and practice (e.g., university classes, academic and industry labs, conferences) become more diverse, there is a pressing need to revise the universal collaborative and pedagogical structures supporting them. Specifically, it has become urgent to explore how to 'de-center' dominant assumptions about who learns in these environments. The goal of this workshop is to explore collectively how to craft learning spaces that resist universality by recognizing and valuing other perspectives and realities. We build on the scholarship of decolonial thinkers, which provides useful theoretical scaffolding on how to start working towards inclusivity and 'pluriversality'. That is, learning spaces where all views can co-exist as equally valid, albeit contradicting. Our workshop will be led by researchers and designers who have both guided and participated in academic and industry-based CSCW learning spaces across domains like Social Computing, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD), Critical Data Studies, and Participatory Design (PD). We invite a broad range of participants from research and practice interested in learning about or deepening their understanding of how to make of CSCW a more 'pluriversal' site for learning and practicing.},

Such projects inherently face the challenge of establishing a sustainable software engineering culture. A major challenge thereby is that project consortia need to establish a distributed developer community that effectively and resource-efficiently aligns development efforts with the goals and needs of complex societal constellations beyond project lifetime. In this paper we extract empirical evidence from longitudinal studies in two large-scale research projects to outline typical challenges in such problem contexts and to develop an open source software engineering methodology for research projects, including supportive infrastructure and social instruments of community building and awareness. We thus contribute a comprehensive strategy preparing collaborative research projects for sustainable societal software engineering.},

abstract = {Guided by a human-centered design focus on users' needs, Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) research and practice have increasingly explored how to address the multiple inequities affecting historically marginalized groups. A growing body of CSCW and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, building upon education and community development literature, argues that centering on needs dismisses marginalized users' capacity for driving change. Needs-based views often lead to designs for the "here and now,'' further marginalizing populations and perpetuating stereotypes. In contrast, an assets-based approach that puts users' knowledge, strengths, and capacities---textitassets ---at the core of design can better promote sustained impact. Translating assets into meaningful designs that interact with intersecting systems of oppression, however, raises critical questions:What are assets? Whose assets are privileged? What ethical considerations surface when facilitating assets-based reflections? How can an assets-based design tackle systems-level problems? In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and industry actors to explore the implications of assets-based perspectives across domains, including Education, Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD), and Participatory Design (PD). Specifically, we will work to develop guidelines and methodologies for CSCW researchers and designers to identify when and how to pursue an assets-based approach, navigating issues of power to translate assets into design effectively.},

abstract = {Learning the dependency relations among entities and the hierarchy formed by these relations by mapping entities into some order embedding space can effectively enable several important applications, including knowledge base completion and prerequisite relations prediction. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to learn a good order embedding due to the existence of partial ordering and missing relations in the observed data. Moreover, most application scenarios do not provide non-trivial negative dependency relation instances. We therefore propose a framework that performs dependency relation prediction by exploring both rich semantic and hierarchical structure information in the data. In particular, we propose several negative sampling strategies based on graph-specific centrality properties, which supplement the positive dependency relations with appropriate negative samples to effectively learn order embeddings. This research not only addresses the needs of automatically recovering missing dependency relations, but also unravels dependencies among entities using several real-world datasets, such as course dependency hierarchy involving course prerequisite relations, job hierarchy in organizations, and paper citation hierarchy. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the prediction accuracy as well as to gain insights using the learned order embedding.},

Traversing populous commercial and residential centers, these shuttles are already operating in several cities. In the absence of a human driver and embedded means of communicating the autonomous shuttle's intent, the task of seamlessly navigating crosswalks and pedestrian-friendly zones becomes a challenging pursuit for pedestrians.We contribute to the emerging notion of AV-Pedestrian Interaction by examining the context of autonomous passenger shuttles (APS) in real-world settings, and by comparing four different classes of visual signals -- namely instructional, symbolic, metaphorical, and anthropomorphic -- designed to communicate the shuttle's intentions. Following a participatory methodology involving local residents and public transport service provider, and working within the framework of inflexible road traffic regulations concerning the operation and testing of autonomous vehicles, we conducted a participatory design workshop, a qualitative, and a survey study. The findings revealed differences across these four classes of signals in terms of pedestrians' subjective perceptions. Anthropomorphic signals were identified as the preferred and effective modality in terms of pedestrians' interpretation of the communicated intent and their perceived sense of attention, confidence, and calmness. Additionally, pedestrians' experiences while judging the intention of transitionary vehicular states (starting/slowing) were reported as perplexing and evoked stress. These findings were translated into design and policy implications in collaboration with other stakeholders, and exemplify a viable way for assimilating human factors research in urban mobility.},

abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},

abstract = {Research in robotics and human-robot interaction is becoming more and more mature. Additionally, more affordable social robots are being released commercially. Thus, industry is currently demanding ideas for viable commercial applications to situate social robots in public spaces and enhance customers experience. However, present literature in human-robot interaction does not provide a clear set of guidelines and a methodology to (i) identify commercial applications for robotic platforms able to position the users» needs at the centre of the discussion and (ii) ensure the creation of a positive user experience. With this paper we propose to fill this gap by providing a methodology for the design of robotic applications including these desired features, suitable for integration by researchers, industry, business and government organisations. As we will show in this paper, we successfully employed this methodology for an exploratory field study involving the trial implementation of a commercially available, social humanoid robot at an airport.},

abstract = {Human--building interaction (HBI) is converging the fields of architecture and interaction design, leading to new and interesting tensions in perspectives and methodological approaches. One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term.},

The Ambient Kitchen is a lab-based replication of a real kitchen where careful design has hidden the additional technology, and allows both the evaluation of pervasive computing prototypes and the simultaneous capture of the multiple synchronized streams of sensor data. Previous work exploring the requirements for situated support for people with cognitive impairments motivated the design of the physical and technical infrastructure and we describe both our motivations and previous work on interaction design in kitchen environments. Finally, we describe how our lab-based prototype has been put to use as: a design tool for designers; a design tool for users; an observatory to collect sensor data for activity recognition algorithm development, and an evaluation test bed. The limitations and advantages of lab-based, as opposed to in situ home-based testing, are discussed},

Collaboration support tools aim to reduce the adverse effects of this restricted access to the fluid intermixing of speech, gesturing, writing and sketching by providing mechanisms to enhance the awareness of distributed participants of each others' actions.In this work we explore novel ways to leverage the capabilities of multimodal context-aware systems to bridge co-located and distributed collaboration contexts. We describe a system that allows participants at remote sites to collaborate in building a project schedule via sketching on multiple distributed whiteboards, and show how participants can be made aware of naturally occurring pointing gestures that reference diagram constituents as they are performed by remote participants.The system explores the multimodal fusion of pen, speech and 3D gestures, coupled to the dynamic construction of a semantic representation of the interaction, anchored on the sketched diagram, to provide feedback that overcomes some of the intrinsic ambiguities of pointing gestures.},

abstract = {We propose HeadGesture, a hands-free input approach to interact with Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices. Using HeadGesture, users do not need to raise their arms to perform gestures or operate remote controllers in the air. Instead, they perform simple gestures with head movement to interact with the devices. In this way, users' hands are free to perform other tasks, e.g., taking notes or manipulating tools. This approach also reduces the hand occlusion of the field of view [11] and alleviates arm fatigue [7]. However, one main challenge for HeadGesture is to distinguish the defined gestures from unintentional movements. To generate intuitive gestures and address the issue of gesture recognition, we proceed through a process of Exploration - Design - Implementation - Evaluation. We first design the gesture set through experiments on gesture space exploration and gesture elicitation with users. Then, we implement algorithms to recognize the gestures, including gesture segmentation, data reformation and unification, feature extraction, and machine learning based classification. Finally, we evaluate user performance of HeadGesture in the target selection experiment and application tests. The results demonstrate that the performance of HeadGesture is comparable to mid-air hand gestures, measured by completion time. Additionally, users feel significantly less fatigue than when using hand gestures and can learn and remember the gestures easily. Based on these findings, we expect HeadGesture to be an efficient supplementary input approach for HMD devices.},

abstract = {Most commonly used approaches to developing automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems are Big Data-driven and machine learning-based. However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders' tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders' needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project "Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia" to illustrate our method. We intend this paper to contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning the use of algorithms in supporting critical decision-making in society.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of the iconic Aware Home project [39] in 1999, the notion of “living laboratory” has been taken up and developed in HCI research. Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed—inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as “Visited Places,” “Instrumented Places,” “Instrumented People,” “Lived-in Places,” and “Innovation Spaces.” In the first part of this article, we describe in detail the method and outcome of our analysis that draws out the five strands. Building on the results of the first part, in the second part of this article, each of the five types of living lab is discussed using some of the prototypical examples of that kind presented in the literature. Finally, we discuss the raison d’\^{e}tre and future position of the living lab as a method within HCI research and design and in relation to advances in sensing technologies and the emerging world of intelligent built environments (e.g., smart city and smart home).},

The traceability between releases and commits would facilitate a systematic choice of history in units of the project evolution scale (i.e., commits that constitute a software release). For example, the major release 25.0 in Chrome is mapped to the earliest revision 157687 and latest revision 165096 in the trunk. Using this traceability, an empirical study is reported on the frequency distribution of file changes for different release windows. In Chrome, the majority (50%) of the committed files change only once between a pair of consecutive releases. This trend is reversed after expanding the window size to at least 10. That is, the majority (50%) of the files change multiple times when commits constituting 10 or greater releases are considered. These results suggest that a training set of at least 10 releases is needed to provide a prediction coverage for majority of the files.},

Inference in MSBNs can be performed effectively using their compiled representations. The compilation involves cooperative moralization and triangulation of the set of local graphical structures that collectively defines the dependencies among domain variables. Privacy of agents prevents us from compiling MSBNs by first assembling graphical subnets at a central location and then compiling their union. In earlier work, agents perform compilation in a limited parallel via a depth-first traversal of the local structures organized in a tree structure (called hypertree). Agents need some synchronization with each other. In this paper, we present an iterative method, by which multiple agents compile MSBNs asynchronously. Compared to the traversal method, the iterative one is self-adaptive and robust.},

abstract = {Evidence exist that e-Governance can facilitate the delivery of information and services needed by stakeholders, citizens, and decision makers in a cost-effective, efficient, and streamlined way; representing a possible solution for some developing countries, such as Afghanistan. As so emerges the need for deliver services and provide access to information in a seamless way. Being the first step to interconnect e-service applications and make them interoperate in all governmental institutions. Or go beyond methodologies for deployment of interoperability frameworks, and extend governance best practices to include various stages and activities for provision of e-services. This article aims to discuss the readiness of Afghan government for deploying e-government services and solutions. It uses Ministry of Education as a particular case study.},

abstract = {Illiteracy is a global problem that impacts societal and economic growth and development, and is directly correlated with the financial success, health and overall well-being of individuals. Studies indicate that picture-book reading within a facilitated story-time setting is an important tool for language acquisition in children. The proposed research hypothesizes that in an increasingly digital society, literacy can be cultivated in a robot-embedded environment that is, at once, physical, digital and evocative of the picture-book being read. Inspired by concepts of embodied interaction, the research team proposes the design, implementation and evaluation of an intelligent, fine-tunable suite of architectural-robotic artifacts -- the LIT ROOM - distributed at room-scale in a public library setting. Through a reconfigurable, co-adaptive learning environment, the LIT ROOM aims to augment the dialogical reading of picture-books within an engaging and exploratory space for the advancement of literacy and learning.},

abstract = {Software requirements express the requirements and constraints on a software product that contributes to the satisfaction of some 'need' in the real world. Ambiguity is a major problem in requirements specification. At its most basic, a requirement is a property that a system must exhibit in order for it to meet the system's motivating need. We ignore intentional ambiguity or the ambiguity that exists in early stages of requirements elicitation and focus on ambiguity that remains in a so-called final natural language requirements document. Ambiguity is a problem because the different readers of the requirements specification may understand different things.An essential property of all requirements is that they should be verifiable. In a typical project there will be a large number of requirements derived from different sources and expressed at different levels of detail. The existing Requirement Engineering Techniques and Methodologies are supporting to a specific set of activity like Elicitation or validation. Requirement Engineering develops a mutual understanding between customers and project teams about the product or system requirements. An agreed-upon and approved product requirement becomes the initial baseline for product design. Knowledge of ambiguous, inconsistent requirements to requirement engineer increases the capability to view the requirements from different perspectives.This paper discusses the requirement generation process and allied activities in it. It also focuses on methodologies, models and techniques for requirement engineering. As a part of applying complete requirement engineering, we claim that the crucial issues like architecture and design in system development can be effectively addressed.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume of the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches for processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of information about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capability in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-time multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various modalities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapters discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on tools and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expanding field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep learning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.}

abstract = {Telepresence robotics is a sophisticated form of robotic remote control in which a human operator has a sense of being on location -- that is, of being telepresent. I propose a demonstration of two telepresence robots, one floor model (VGo) and one tabletop model (KUBI). In this proposal, I describe the technology and briefly summarize the research that led to the purchase of the robots. The research focused on the telepresence needs of a mobility-impaired academic and included a user study as well as a review of the affordances of commercially-available telepresence robotic devices. The implications extend beyond uses of telepresence robots in cases of mobility impairment to academic contexts in general.},

abstract = {We compare two approaches for exploring large, hierarchical data spaces on mobile devices using facets. While the first approach arranges the facets in a 3x3 grid, the second approach makes use of a scrollable list of facets for exploring the data. As concrete scenario, we use category hierarchies that are dynamically obtained from different, distributed social media sources. We have conducted a between-group experiment of the two approaches with 64 subjects (41 male, 23 female) executing the same set of tasks of typical mobile users' information needs. The results show that subjects using the grid-based approach require significantly more time and more clicks for completing the tasks. However, regarding the subjects' satisfaction there is no significant difference between the two approaches. Thus, if efficiency is not the primary objective, the grid-based approach might be of interest as it provides a navigation element that allows the users to see the exact position in the data space. This might be a very useful feature in scenarios where knowing the exact position is quite crucial such as browsing classification schemas in digital libraries or other formal taxonomies.},

abstract = {Modeling has a strong focus in current science learning frameworks as a critical skill for students to learn. However, understanding students' scientific models and their modeling practices at scale is a difficult task that has not been taken up by the research literature. The complex variables involved in classroom learning, such as teacher differences, increase the difficulty of understanding this problem. This work begins with an exploration of the methods used to explore students' scientific modeling in the learning sciences space and the frameworks developed to characterize student modeling practices. Learning analytics can be used to leverage these frameworks of scientific modeling practices to explore questions around students' scientific models and their modeling practices. These analyses are focused around the use of EcoSurvey, a collaborative, digital tool used in high-school biology classrooms to model the local ecosystem. This tool was deployed in ten biology classrooms and used with varying degrees of success. There are significant teacher-level differences found in the activity sequences of students using the EcoSurvey tool. The theoretical metrics around scientific modeling practices and automatically extracted feature sequences were also used in a classification task to automatically determine a particular student's teacher. These results underline the power of learning analytics methods to give insight into how modeling practices are realized in the classroom. This work also informs changes to modeling tools, associated curricula, and supporting professional development around scientific modeling.},

I respectfully welcome everyone who is interested to engage in meaningful dialogue about activist gaming and pedagogy [7]. In this session, I report findings of youth being@play with digital media and technology at 101 Technology Fun, two intensive one-week gaming and robotic research camps held in a technology-rich lab at the University of British Columbia. Child-technology interrelations are characterized according to a six-fold typology that draws from social, ethical and cognitive domains: recognition, feeling, attention, engagement, contact and attachment. My goal is to educe a sensitive attunement and thoughtful attentiveness towards understanding how youth act-in and perceive their being-in this milieu technique. I invite you to critically consider and to reflect deeply upon how today's youth are be-thinged [bedingt]: simultaneously dependent upon, inhabited by, immersed in, and indifferent to the digital media and technology in their lives [9]. If we take a step back and depart from our pre-determined views and the normative assumptions that legitimatize the already-known, might it be possible to think differently and to question the as-yet unimagined possibilities for technology to shape our children's worlds, particularly in ways that escape our scrutiny of thought?},

abstract = {Workplace collaborators make use of diverse types of documents and other resources. Traditionally, each type of document has been stored in its own repository, and people have had to manage multiple documents in multiple storage services. Workplace collaborators often have complex, ad hoc working relations that are partially executed through their shared documents. Traditionally, dependencies among documents and other objects have gone unrecorded, or have been stored in a piecemeal manner inside the documents, or have been objectified and rigidified in workflow engines. Workplace collaborators often need to coordinate with one another, both asynchronously and in real-time, and often in the context of their shared documents. Traditionally, people had no idea of the status of their collaborators, or they have had to consult other, unrelated services for awareness or presence information about their colleagues.We aim to change that. I will describe our research, findings, and possible futures of systems and services that are intended to unify the ways that people collaborate with and through shared documents. In our ActivityExplorer project, users innovated new ways of using our software, showing that a service with collections of shared documents, fine-grained access control, persistent communications, and real-time status information could serve diverse needs of a workplace of individuals, teams, and communities. Our Unified Activity Management project explored the harvesting of collective enactments, and their crystallization into work practices templates and rich placeholders for future collaborations. These ideas have led to successful technology transfer, and are making their way into products.In the course of this work, we sometimes found that simple ideas were much more popular than expected, paradoxically creating new challenges for users. I will describe two of those challenges, and our attempts to meet them. This new research has led us into domains of interruption management, machine learning, and very much into social computing, including technology transfer into another generation of collaboration products.People work together through direct communication and through shared documents. At every turn, people surprise us with their ingenuity and their ability to create new human and technological solutions with the systems that we offer them. I will close with a discussion of the concept of reinvention (innovation through usage), and how technology developers and users can learn from one another through cycles of development and usage, with innovative contributions from all parties at each turn of the cycle.},

On the basis of a pilot implementation of a system for coordinating the transport of patients by hospital porters, we investigate pilot implementation as a method for participatory design. We find that to foster participation and learning about user needs a pilot implementation must create a space for reflecting on use, in addition to the space for using the pilot system. The space for reflection must also exist during the activities preparing the use of the pilot system because the porters and nurses learned about their needs throughout the pilot implementation, not just during use. Finally, we discuss how the scope and duration of a pilot implementation influence the conditions for participation.},

Futuristic autobiographies are the creative work of the researchers and participants. Grounded in empirical and background work, researchers pose several stories involving the participant as a character about a future state with robots. Participants are then asked to weave fictional autobiographies to explain what led to this future state. Via a case study in which futuristic autobiographies were used with 23 roboticists, we detail the process involved in developing and implementing this method. When futuristic autobiographies are employed and carefully crafted from background research, they allow informants to speak for themselves on how their practices and values are intertwined now and in the future. We highlight both the benefits and challenges of futuristic autobiographies as a way to elicit rich stories about values. We argue that futuristic autobiographies are a promising addition to the current qualitative methods toolkit used in HRI.},

abstract = {Digital humanities methods and techniques have been applied to a wide spectrum of disciplines with results there were not attainable otherwise. However, uncertainty is present in any DH endeavour, in various types and degrees, due to the very nature of both humanist research and the intervention of computers to enable such kind of research methodologies. On the one hand, information sources need to be converted into digital form and, on the other hand, the resulting digital objects are processed to obtain summaries, geographic and temporal distributions, networks, patterns, etc., that are presented to and interpreted by the researchers or users of the DH projects. From the digitalization to the interpretation, both the computational and cognitive steps involved are subject to uncertainty. The track "Uncertainty in Digital Humanities" of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2018), tries to bring together researchers in Digital Humanities and reflect on the opportunities and challenges related to the way in which uncertainty can be better understood and pave the way towards appropriate methods and tools of dealing with uncertainty that improve the support to humanists when generating new knowledge.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of inferring the design intentions of a human by an intelligent virtual agent that collaborates with the human. First, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network model that relates design intentions, objectives, and solutions during a human's exploration of a problem space. We then train the model on design behaviors generated by a search agent and use the model parameters to infer the design intentions in a test set of real human behaviors. We find that our model is able to infer the exact intentions across three objectives associated with a sequence of design outcomes 31.3% of the time. Inference accuracy is 50.9% for the top two predictions and 67.2% for the top three predictions. For any singular intention over an objective, the model's mean F1-score is 0.719. This provides a reasonable foundation for an intelligent virtual agent to infer design intentions purely from design outcomes toward establishing joint intentions with a human designer. These results also shed light on the potential benefits and pitfalls in using simulated data to train a model for human design intentions.},

This paper presents a concept of our mobile Social Agent EmmA in the role of a vocational reintegration assistant for burn-out outpatient treatment. We follow a typical par- ticipatory design approach including experts and patients in order to address requirements from both sides. Since the success of such treatments is related to a patients emotion regulation capabilities, we employ a real-time social signal interpretation together with a computational simulation of emotion regulation that influences the agent's social behavior as well as the situational selection of verbal treatment strategies. Overall, our interdisciplinary approach sketches a novel integrative concept for Social Agents as assistants for burn-out patients.},

In our approach we consider whether this is a case of posing robots as solutions to wicked problems or if robots can be considered wicked design problems in themselves. At the same time we make an argument for adopting a research through design approach. Our stance suggests that by viewing robots as composed of design materials we can sensitively address and in the long run perhaps even avoid wicked problems related to robotics.},

abstract = {Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers (n = 50), which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9781538685556},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Many new technologies are being built to support people with dementia. However, they largely focus on the people with dementia; consequently, informal caregivers, one of the most important stakeholders in dementia care, remain invisible within the technology design space. In this paper, we present a six-month long, community-based design research process where we collaborated with dementia caregiver support groups to design robots for dementia caregiving. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we broaden the context of dementia robot design to give a more prominent role to informal family caregivers in the co-design process. Second, we provide new design guidelines that contextualize robots within the family caregiving paradigm, which suggest new roles and behaviors of robots. These include lessening emotional labor by communicating information caregivees do not want to hear (e.g., regarding diet or medication) or providing redirection during emotionally difficult times, as well as facilitating positive shared moments. Third, our work found connections between certain robot attributes and their relationship to the stage of dementia a caregivee is experiencing. For example, caregivers wanted their robots to facilitate interaction with their caregivees in early stages of dementia, yet be in the background. However, for later stages of dementia, they wanted robots to replace caregiver-caregivee interaction to lessen their emotional burden, and be foregrounded. These connections provide important insights in to how we think about adaptability and long-term interaction in HRI. We hope our work provides new avenues for HRI researchers to studying robots for dementia caregivers by engaging in community-based design.},

Previous work has also argued that mid-air gestural input can cause discomfort and arm fatigue over time, which can be addressed in a desktop setting by allowing users to gesture in alternative restful arm positions (e.g., elbow rests on desk). However, it is unclear if and how gesture preferences and gesture designs would be different for alternative arm positions. In order to inquire these research question we report on a user and choice based gesture elicitation study in which 10 participants designed gestures for different arm positions. We provide an in-depth qualitative analysis and detailed categorization of gestures, discussing commonalities and differences in the gesture sets based on a "think aloud" protocol, video recordings, and self-reports on user preferences.},

With the large scale adoption of sensor use, studies on co-located collaboration (CC) has gained momentum. CC takes place in physical spaces where the group members share each other’s social and epistemic space. This involves subtle multimodal interactions such as gaze, gestures, speech, discourse which are complex in nature. The aim of this PhD is to detect these interactions and then use these insights to build an automated real-time feedback system to facilitate co-located collaboration.},

The particular focus here is on learning about ideas in Balance Control through observing one's own body motions and programming physical robots to perform balancing acts, such as balancing an inverted pendulum. The study involved two groups of learners, ages 13 to 15, over twelve months. The physical robots have a dual-mode ability that allowed learners to record and observe motions while controlling the robots manually by hand as well as under program control. A custom-made Logo programming environment together with new 2D graphical elements was created. The results not only show examples of Balance Control concepts that emerged, but highlight the learning process that was made accessible only through the computational technology.},

abstract = {Open card sorting is used by information architects to gather insights from users to incorporate feedback into an information architecture. In theory, it is one of the more inexpensive, user-centered design methods available to practitioners, but hidden costs make it less likely to be conducted properly and affect the quality of results produced. The following proposes a new card sorting method called the Modified-Delphi card sort to replace the Open card sort. The Modified-Delphi card sort is based on a well-known forecasting technique called the Delphi method. Instead of producing individual models that are then analyzed as a whole, participants work with a single model that is proposed and modified throughout the study. The Modified-Delphi card sorting method produces more useful results to aid in the design of an information architecture than the Open card sorting method.A series of studies were conducted to directly compare the Modified-Delphi and Open cart sorting methods. First, two parallel studies using both methods were conducted with the same dataset and number of participants. Then, two studies were conducted on the results of the parallel studies: a heuristic review and ranking with information design experts and an Inverse card sort with additional users of the proposed architecture. The Modified-Delphi card sorting method produced results that were found to be at least as good as the Open card sorting method results and in some cases, better.},

To rapidly turn data from experiments into practical improvements, the system uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to analyze students' ratings of which conditions are helpful, and present conditions to future students in proportion to the evidence they are higher rated. We evaluated the system by collaboratively deploying experiments in the courses of three mathematics instructors. They reported benefits in reflecting on their pedagogy, and having a new method for improving online problems for future students.},

abstract = {Elderly people and persons with a disability may face significant limitations when using the standard "sitting" type water toilet as mostly used in the Western World. In this paper a new type of a stationary robotic toilet is outlined and the concept of the smart interaction between user and envisaged robotic toilet is described. Main functionality are height and tilt adjustment, support of sitting down and standing up, speech interaction, automatic recognition of the user and corresponding preferred settings of the toilet and automatic inference of potential emergency situations. The interaction is challenging due to the very different needs of the target group, the physical contact to the robotic system (actually the user is sitting on the robot) and the taboo area of toileting. First prototypes are currently being built and are planned to enter the evaluation stage early 2017.},

abstract = {In this study, we present stakeholder analyses of firm-related web forums. Prior analyses of firm-related forums have considered all participants in the aggregate, failing to recognize the potential for diversity within the populations. However, distinctive groups of forum participants may represent various interests and stakes in a firm worthy of consideration. To perform the stakeholder analyses, the Stakeholder Analyzer system for firm-related web forums is developed following the design science paradigm of information systems research. The design of the system and its approach to stakeholder analysis is guided by two kernel theories, the stakeholder theory of the firm and the systemic functional linguistic theory. A stakeholder analysis identifies distinctive groups of forum participants with shared characteristics expressed in discussion and evaluates their specific opinions and interests in the firm. Stakeholder analyses are performed in six major firm-related forums hosted on Yahoo Finance over a 3-month period. The relationships between measures extracted from the forums and subsequent daily firm stock returns are examined using multiple linear regression models, revealing statistically significant indicators of firm stock returns in the discussions of the stakeholder groups of each firm with stakeholder-model-adjusted R2 values reaching 0.83. Daily stock return prediction is also performed for 31 trading days, and stakeholder models correctly predicted the direction of return on 67% of trading days and generated an impressive 17% return in simulated trading of the six firm stocks. These evaluations demonstrate that the stakeholder analyses provided more refined assessments of the firm-related forums, yielding measures at the stakeholder group level that better explain and predict daily firm stock returns than aggregate forum-level information.},

The first study applied two methods of Value Sensitive Design, namely stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these two cases, this paper responds to a need of practical means to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics systems. These two cases demonstrate that Value Sensitive Design could be a viable approach for balancing a wide range of human values, which tend to encompass and surpass ethical issues, in learning analytics design.},

abstract = {Conversational agent technology is an emerging paradigm for creating a social environment in online groups that is conducive to effective teamwork. Prior work has demonstrated advantages in terms of learning gains and satisfaction scores when groups learning together online have been supported by conversational agents that employ Balesian social strategies. This prior work raises two important questions that are addressed in this article. The first question is one of generality. Specifically, are the positive effects of the designed support specific to learning contexts? Or are they in evidence in other collaborative task domains as well? We present a study conducted within a collaborative decision-making task where we see that the positive effects of the Balesian social strategies extend to this new context. The second question is whether it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the Balesian social strategies by increasing the context sensitivity with which the social strategies are triggered. To this end, we present technical work that increases the sensitivity of the triggering. Next, we present a user study that demonstrates an improvement in performance of the support agent with the new, more sensitive triggering policy over the baseline approach from prior work.The technical contribution of this article is that we extend prior work where such support agents were modeled using a composition of conversational behaviors integrated within an event-driven framework. Within the present approach, conversation is orchestrated through context-sensitive triggering of the composed behaviors. The core effort involved in applying this approach involves building a set of triggering policies that achieve this orchestration in a time-sensitive and coherent manner. In line with recent developments in data-driven approaches for building dialog systems, we present a novel technique for learning behavior-specific triggering policies, deploying it as part of our efforts to improve a socially capable conversational tutor agent that supports collaborative learning.},

abstract = {Design in many settings is an inherently collective and creative undertaking, with phenomena of emergence at the heart of the activity. Cognitive accounts of emergence in the context of design have not taken its collective nature into account. At the same time accounts of collective emergence do not recognize certain salient attributes of design, including the importance of visual thinking and various media for external representation. With reference to two distinct theories of emergence, Oxman's account of design emergence in terms of visual cognition, and Sawyer's account of collaborative emergence in conversation and performance, this paper reports results from a study of a high-performing, technologically mediated concurrent design practice. Participant observation, interviews, and video interaction analysis were used to render the creative process of engineering design in fine-grained detail. The resulting insights support aspects of both theories in that creative activity appears to proceed substantially through modalities of visual cognition, while collaborative products are arrived at through an essentially collective process involving multiple participants and unpredictable developments. The combined view presents a richer picture than either theory alone.},

This new stage is characterised by the focus on data-driven and evidence-based decision and policy making, where disruptive technologies are deployed. Along this, the engagement of citizens and other stakeholders both in data provision and co-creation continues to be crucial. One way to increase citizen participation is through the introduction of gamification elements into the digital government services. In this paper, the authors review literature and projects on gamification as a tool for improving citizen participation rates in Government 3.0. Based on this, avenues for further research are outlined in the area, taking into consideration a) the knowledge collected from recent EU-funded projects involving gamification and b) the opinions of experts in the domain, which were collected along interactive workshops. Finally, five research needs are identified and outlined for gamification in digital government.},

abstract = {Pervasive computing is a vision that has been an inspiring long-term target for many years now. Interaction techniques that allow one user to efficiently control many screens, or that allow several users to collaborate on one distant screen, are still hot topics, and are often considered as two different questions. Standard approaches require a strong coupling between the physical location of input device, and users. We propose to consider these two questions through the same basic concept, that uncouples physical location and user input, using a mid-air approach. We present the concept of mimetic interaction spaces (MIS), a dynamic user-definition of an imaginary input space thanks to an iconic gesture, that can be used to define mid-air interaction techniques. We describe a participative design user-study, that shows this technique has interesting acceptability and elicit some definition and deletion gestures. We finally describe a design space for MIS-based interaction, and show how such concept may be used for multi-screen control, as well as screen sharing in pervasive environments.},

However, as we attempt to design for more complex operations, the expectation of spatial manipulation becomes infeasible.We introduce Multi-tap Sliders for operation in what we call abstract parametric spaces that do not have an obvious literal spatial representation, such as exposure, brightness, contrast and saturation for image editing. This new widget design promotes multi-touch interaction for prolonged use in scenarios that require adjustment of multiple parameters as part of an operation. The multi-tap sliders encourage the user to keep her visual focus on the target, instead of the requiring to look back at the interface.Our research emphasizes ergonomics, clear visual design, and fluid transition between the selection of parameters and their subsequent adjustment for a given operation. We demonstrate a new technique for quickly selecting and adjusting multiple numerical parameters. A preliminary user study points out improvements over the traditional sliders.},

abstract = {Learning activities use an increasing number of software tools. These mediate the interactions among participants and of these with resources like documents and tools. These tools constitute a valuable source of information about the actual learning processes. However, this use faces multiple problems. Lecturers need to gain expertise on the data each tool provides and how to analyse them, each tool only offers a partial view of the process, students have different profiles and use different tools, and time to make analyses is limited. To address this situation, this work proposes the use of Assistants for Learning Activities (ALAs), i.e. semi-automated tools that use social knowledge to integrate different sources of information and interpret their data. This knowledge is extracted from literature on learning, and specified as social properties. These properties describe patterns that appear in information and their interpretation in terms of the learning-related activities. Their specification relies on a specific modelling language oriented to social activities and their context. It is designed to facilitate communication with the target learning communities. Wrappers for software tools get the raw data, transform them into facts for this language, and assert them in an information base. Then, a pattern matching algorithm finds instances of the social properties among these facts, giving an interpretation of the original data. A case study on teamwork in a project-based learning context of a university using several software tools illustrates the approach. It shows the feasibility of adapting the analysis through the modification of the considered properties, and how these can explain the observed data.},

Emphasis was put on topics that are infrequent in mainstream HCI such as machine movement, autonomy, anthropomorphism, physical interaction, environmental issues and issues concerned more generally with cultural notions of robots.},

abstract = {Assistive robots are becoming an increasingly important application platform for research in robotics, AI, and HRI, as there is a pressing need to develop systems that support the elderly and people with disabilities, with a clear path to market. Yet, what remains unclear is whether current autonomous systems are already up to the task or whether additional HRI work is needed to make these systems acceptable and useful.In this article, we report our efforts of developing and evaluating an architecture for a fully autonomous robot designed to assist older adults with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in sorting their medications. The main goal for the robot is to aid users in a manner that maintains the autonomy of the user by providing cognitive and social support with varying levels of assistance. We first evaluated the robot with subjects drawn from a pool of university students, which is common practice in experimental work in psychology and HRI. As the results were very positive, we followed up with an evaluation using people with Parkinson’s disease, who surprisingly had mostly negative outcomes. We thus report our analysis of the differences in the evaluations and discuss the challenges for HRI posed by the sources of the negative evaluations: (1) designing a robot to adapt to the many routines the participants use at home, (2) unique needs of participants with PD not present in student participants, and (3) the role of familiar technologies in designing and evaluating a new technology. While it is unlikely, given the current state of technology, that fully autonomous assistive robots for older adults will be available in the near term, we believe that our work exposes a critical need in HRI to involve the target population as early as possible in the design process.},

abstract = {We propose an approach for improving the digitization of shape and color of 3D artworks in a cluttered environment using 3D laser scanning and flash photography. To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.},

In this paper, we present relevant insights from a well-established gaming community, the larp (Live Action Role Play) community. This community has a longstanding tradition of making use of costumes, physical environments, and objects to shape player experience. We conducted a survey completed by 39 larpers concerning how they use digital technology in larp, and the way technology is designed and appropriated to augment the larp experience. Here, we present early results in the form of a preliminary taxonomy of technologies in larps, as well as key trends for design, use, and appropriation of technology to impact in-game social and emotional experience.},

We motivated the approach with a real-world PVC poncho trade problem and explained it in architecture of collaborative process design and automatic service provision. We reported the implementation specification within a hybrid human-agent framework, where four layers of system modules are specified. The approach is evaluated based on a new semantic impact chain method particularly for evaluating concept consistency in meaning representation between heterogeneous contexts of business processes.},

abstract = {We are pleased to share with you the Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Creativity and Cognition. The Proceedings contains research from an amazingly diverse array of disciplines, perspectives, and methodological approaches. The conference topic of 'everyday creativity' reminds us of the varied ways in which individuals and groups can be innovative, inventive, ingenious, and resourceful not only in the arts, science, engineering, and design, but also in addressing situations that arise in everyday life.Out of 137 submitted full papers we could publish only 34, for a full-paper acceptance rate of 25%. The Proceedings also includes a set of eleven short papers from the Graduate Student Symposium, showcasing the emerging perspectives of new voices in this community. The 14 demos and 36 posters presented at the conference are represented here by short papers, as are the thirteen art pieces and seven live performances. The Proceedings also includes brief outlines of invited keynote talks, conference workshops, and tutorials. This year's papers fall into six broad themes of Young Creators; Inclusion and Identity; Culture and Context; Theories, Methods, Metrics, and Tools; Art and Craft; and Design.A group of three papers on Young Creators looks at children in science, music, and storytelling. One paper studies two online communities that mediate children working with scientists; another reports on teenagers doing computer music; and the third on technology-augmented environments for children's storytelling.Two Inclusion and Identity papers look at social aspects. One discusses a project that engaged older men in participatory design, in an effort to tackle digital exclusion. The other paper in this category confronts questions of prejudice, stigma, and the creation of social identities in online environments.The four Culture and Context papers go beyond individuals and view creativity as a phenomenon in the broader community. Two papers on childhood and education examine, respectively, the American and Australian contexts; a third describes six creativity support tools developed in a community-based robotics project. The fourth paper reports on the use of cultural probes for design in a village in Rwanda.Seven papers on Theories, Metrics, Methods, and Tools view creativity as a process that can be explicitly modeled, measured, and supported. One establishes the 'Creativity Support Index', a survey metric to help researchers and designers evaluate the level of creativity support that various systems provide. Another reports on a study using 'Computational Metaphor Identification,' a textual analysis technique, to foster metaphorical creativity in science education. A third paper investigates how practitioners make sense of their own creative work using the 'Repertory Grid Technique'. A fourth discusses a computational framework that addresses the worth of ideas ascribed by agents embedded in a social world. A fifth, empirical, paper reports on three perspectives on creative interaction: productive, structural, and longitudinal. A sixth considers serendipity in people's interactions with computers, revealing a space for computer-based systems to support serendipitous creativity, innovation and discovery. And a seventh paper studies the relationship of consuming alcohol with perceived and actual creativity.Five papers look at creativity in art--film scoring, theatre, literature, and interactive art--and two more look at craft-- one at digitally printed paper collage; the other at knitting. The paper on film scoring presents a design study, including prototypes, for supporting synchronous and asynchronous collaboration among stakeholders. The theatre paper asks: What are actors thinking as they engage in improvisational theatre? The literature paper describes the RiTa computational toolkit for writing, and its use in a computational literature class. A case study of the design of an interactive art piece and the audience's experience reflects on the relationship of play and complexity. And a reflective paper looks at algorithmic art from its early days to postulate about relationships between art, artists, creativity, and society.Finally, the largest group of papers is about design. Three focus on creative processes in design, for example papers on 'microsketching,' prototyping, and generative walk-throughs. The fourth investigates how designers can learn from stroke patients' designs for assistive devices. A case study in biologically inspired (biomimetic) design is the topic of a fifth paper in this group. A sixth paper looks at social creation and cultural cognition through the lens of visual and verbal protocols of an architectural design process. Using 'Business Process Excellence', a seventh design paper reports on a case study of how an engineering firm balances risk and creativity. An empirical study employing social network analysis finds that teams scoring higher on perspective taking and team cohesion produce more innovative final designs. The ninth paper in this group reports a fine-grained study of a concurrent engineering design practice using participant observation, interviews, and video interaction analysis. And the tenth describes design-based case studies to derive guidelines for embodied metaphorbased interactional models.},

abstract = {Citizen science is a form of collaboration that engages non-professionals as contributors to scientific research, typically through the processes of gathering, transforming or analyzing data. To date, research has documented examples of hugely successful citizen science projects, such as Zooniverse and eBird, but citizen science also includes hundreds of smaller citizen science and functionally similar digital humanities projects, operating from small-scale web platforms and in-person collaborative teams. Yet, it is unclear what the "science" of citizen science entails: What are the core research questions and methodologies for answering them? What theories and concepts have been associated with citizen science research to date? What are the technology needs for supporting successful research collaboration among diverse stakeholders and across distinctive types of citizen science projects? In this workshop, our goal is to (i) bring together researchers studying citizen science to form a coherent map summarizing the theories, methodologies and platforms that currently defines citizen science research, with a special focus on CHI and CSCW relevant topics (ii) brainstorm a list of fundamental open questions and ways to tackle them, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.},

abstract = {In this paper we report on our experience on the design and evaluation of multimodal user interfaces in various contexts. We introduce a novel combination of existing design and evaluation methods in the form of a 5-step iterative process and show the feasibility of this method and some of the lessons learned through the design of a messaging application for two contexts (in car, walking). The iterative design process we employed included the following five basic steps: 1) identification of the limitations affecting the usage of different modalities in various contexts (contextual observations and context analysis) 2) identifying and selecting suitable interaction concepts and creating a general design for the multimodal application (storyboarding, use cases, interaction concepts, task breakdown, application UI and interaction design), 3) creating modality-specific UI designs, 4) rapid prototyping and 5) evaluating the prototype in naturalistic situations to find key issues to be taken into account in the next iteration. We have not only found clear indications that context affects users' preferences in the usage of modalities and interaction strategies but also identified some of these. For instance, while speech interaction was preferred in the car environment users did not consider it useful when they were walking. 2D (finger strokes) and especially 3D (tilt) gestures were preferred by walking users.},

abstract = {The design of user interfaces (UIs), such as World Wide Web pages, usually consists in a human designer mapping one particular problem (e.g., the demands of a customer) to one particular solution (i.e., the UI). In this article, a technology based on Genetic Programming is proposed to automate critical parts of the design process. In this approach, designers are supposed to define basic content elements and ways to combine them, which are then automatically composed and tested with real users by a genetic algorithm in order to find optimized compositions. Such a strategy enables the exploration of large design state-spaces in a systematic manner, hence going beyond traditional A/B testing approaches. In relation to similar techniques also based on genetic algorithms, this system has the advantage of being more general, providing the basis of an overall programmatic UI design workflow, and of calculating the fitness of solutions incrementally. To illustrate and evaluate the approach, an experiment based on the optimization of landing pages is provided. The empirical result obtained, though preliminary, is statistically significant and corroborates the hypothesis that the technique works.},

abstract = {Recent public discussions about technologies and social values have called for greater consideration of ethics during technology development and deployment, leading many organizations to create and promote compliance- or checklist-oriented toolkits and frameworks to address values and ethical issues. However, surfacing discussion and consideration of ethics in broader, more open-ended ways during the design process may help surface unique needs, social corner cases, or new or different understandings of values and ethics. This one-day workshop will convene CSCW researchers and practitioners to propose and consider new interventions and approaches to ethics in design that go beyond formal checklist- and compliance-oriented approaches. CSCW's rich set of methods when investigating values and ethics provides a starting point for developing new approaches and interventions. These may potentially include design activities, games and roleplaying, critical making, changes to work practice and organizational structure, or conducting empirical research. Our goal is to explore multiple and alternative forms of values and ethics interventions, rather than coming to a particular 'best' approach. This workshop aims to map out a space of interventions for values and ethics, propose new approaches and interventions, and craft an agenda for experimenting with and evaluating new interventions.},

abstract = {A deeper understanding of the interactions between people and artefacts that characterise creative activities could be valuable in designing the next generation of creativity support. This paper presents three perspectives on creative interaction that have emerged from four years of empirical and design research. We argue that creative interaction can be usefully viewed in terms of Productive Interaction - focused engagement on the development of a creative outcome, Structural Interaction - the development of the structures in which production occurs, and Longitudinal Interaction - the long-term development of resources and relationships that increase creative potential. An analysis of each perspective is described, along with the development of an exemplary prototype. The use of the perspectives as a basis for design is considered, including the influence of contextual factors on instances of creative activities.},

Our results add to growing evidence that socially assistive robots (SARs) could play a role in addressing patients' low engagement with self-directed exercise programmes. Specifically, we propose how SARs might augment or offer more pro-active assistance over existing technologies such as smartphone applications, computer software and fitness trackers also designed to tackle this issue. In addition, we present a series of design implications for such SARs based on therapists' expert knowledge and best practices extracted from our results. This includes an initial set of SAR requirements and key considerations concerning personalised and adaptive interaction strategies.},

Evidence show that through dramatic games and role-playing activities young children (aging from 5--7 years old) learn to master new knowledge, to fit in a new school setting and to socially relate with their peers. So taking this evidence into account, it is possible to devise an innovative collaborative learning scenario that teaches early mathematical concepts by telling and creating stories. More than doing it in the traditional formats (oral or theatrical form), we are investigating the possibility to take this scenario to an innovative computerised platform -- Microsoft Surface™.},

A 3rd-space, portable and modular design is described and demonstrated for use in administering and supporting learning in 3D. 3rd-space environments can be designed for enabling multi-purpose, multifunctional devices and tools for learner-centered design and collaborative social learning. The framework offered in this paper supports multiple delivery options involving offline and online access to an OpenSim platform for learning in 3D and the use of Drupal modules for administering and supporting collaborative peer-based social learning. The architecture is demonstrated in two learning in 3D prototypes: a 4-H regional youth leadership robotics project involving a collaborative model-based reasoning simulation game on geothermal energy and a lesson on the early history of the U.

Yet as any tools, they shape the gaze, attitudes, and behaviors of designers. Moreover their generic nature tends to obscure the specific situations in which they were created. In reaction, grounding our work in adversarial design, we propose four tricky probes: believable design tools, which appear to be innocuous, but progressively engage designers in crossing boundaries of what should be acceptable. This is done by slowly derailing design research activities, leading to trigger reflection on the part of designers on their beliefs, practice, and the tools they use. Our probes raise issues at the intersection of design research and gender in urban service design, such as the use of pre-made algorithms to understand gendered patterns in urban movements.},

These included exploring people's ideal embodiment preferences and requirements for a domestic care service robot, and also what embodiments and functional aspects will not be acceptable. We analysed our findings using relevant constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and Technology Acceptance models. In addition to some already well-established findings, we discovered some surprising aspects concerning interaction, behaviour and appearance and the ability for the robot to fit the relevant context, both physically and conceptually.},

In some cases, algorithmic systems may be more or less favorable to certain groups or individuals, sparking substantial discussion of algorithmic fairness in public policy circles, academia, and the press. We broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. We conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the United States. While the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussions about racial injustice and economic inequality. In addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product.},

From this perspective, less attention has yet been paid to imprisoned persons. Many penitentiary systems are formally characterized by the basic requirement of resocialization. Accordingly, life in prison should be largely adapted to conditions outside and to fundamental social changes, which must be considered in designing the framework for prison systems. Still, the digital opening of the prison is debated controversially, not least due to anticipated security issues. Hence, to raise awareness about challenges for digital participation of prisoners, we conducted a knowledge-sociological analysis (SKAD) of the public discourse on the use of ICT by prison inmates in Germany. We thereby seek to advance knowledge and insights from social and organizational practice arising from the use of ICT in context of total institutions and create the basis for action from a socio-informatics perspective.},

Recommendations are based on findings from a media study focusing on how people currently use their IPTV systems and associated devices in their homes. The media study applied an ethnographic oriented method called playful probing. From the user's perspective the ideal smart phone application provides them on a general level with a simplified set of (touch-enabled) buttons to control and navigate. The application should support them in their most frequent tasks (e.g. watching TV, listening to music) and overall shall enhance the experience by providing additional information to the TV channel currently selected, by supporting their need for privacy and by allowing them to achieve a certain level of security. In terms of interaction techniques, users prefer flexible touch interaction and (a limited set of) speech commands over gesture, with the exception of being able to directly point at a device to identify it for direct control.},

abstract = {The content of this handbook would be most appropriate for graduate students, and of primary interest to students studying computer science and information technology, human-computer interfaces, mobile and ubiquitous interfaces, and related multidisciplinary majors. When teaching graduate classes with this book, whether in quarter or semester classes, we recommend initially requiring that students spend two weeks reading the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces (Morgan Claypool, Human-Centered Interfaces Synthesis Series, 2015). This textbook is suitable for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students. With this orientation, a graduate class providing an overview of multimodal-multisensor interfaces then could select chapters from the handbook distributed across topics in the different sections.As an example, in a 10-week quarter course the remaining 8 weeks might be allocated to reading select chapters on: (1) theory, user modeling, common modality combinations (2 weeks); (2) prototyping and software tools, signal processing and architectures (2 weeks); (3) language and dialogue processing (1 week); (4) detection of emotional and cognitive state (2 weeks); and (5) commercialization, future trends, and societal issues (1 week). In a more extended 16-week semester class, we would recommend spending an additional week reading and discussing chapters on each of these five topic areas, as well as an additional week on the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces. As an alternative, in a semester course in which students will be conducting a project in one target area (e.g., designing multimodal dialogue systems for in-vehicle use), some or all of the additional time in the semester course could be spent: (1) reading a more in-depth collection of handbook chapters on language and dialogue processing (e.g., 2 weeks) and (2) conducting the hands-on project (e.g., 4 weeks).For more tailored versions of a course on multimodal-multisensor interfaces, another approach would be to have students read the handbook chapters in relevant sections, and then follow up with more targeted and in-depth technical papers. For example, a course intended for a cognitive science audience might start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters from the handbook sections on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations; (2) multimodal processing of social and emotional information; and (3) multimodal processing of cognition and mental health status. Afterward, the course could teach students different computational and statistical analysis techniques related to these chapters, ideally through demonstration. Students then might be asked to conduct a hands-on project in which they apply one or more analysis methods to multimodal data to build user models or predict mental states. As a second example, a course intended for a computer science audience might also start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters on: (1) prototyping and software tools; (2) multimodal signal processing and architectures; and (3) language and dialogue processing. Afterward, students might engage in a hands-on project in which they design, build, and evaluate the performance of a multimodal system.In all of these teaching scenarios, we anticipate that professors will find this handbook to be a particularly comprehensive and valuable current resource for teaching about multimodal-multisensor interfaces.},

abstract = {Health dialog collection is the primary bottleneck for the training and deployment of conversational agents into clinical practice. Current tools for the development of dialog systems are primarily focused on writing intent-slot schemas for natural language understanding and finite-state models of dialog management. However, this is a time-consuming process that can be opaque for clinical teams and the limitations of both approaches are well understood. The health domain presents additional barriers including access to patients and concerns about exposing personal health information. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, it describes an interface designed to augment the ability of clinicians to efficiently engage in high-quality and empathetic health counseling dialog with their patients. Second, it presents a WOZ protocol for collecting this dialog using standardized patient actors each playing a role from a pool of caregiver personas.},

abstract = {To become effective in the field of computing, gender research must explain its concepts to non-gender studies scholars and to convince them of their relevance. Our title "Making IT Work" claims that both can be done: interlinking gender research and computing, and by that improving IT systems.We present the "Gender-Extended Research and Development" (GERD) model, a process model which combines gender and diversity aspects with all phases of computing research and development. The model with seven phases is a generalization of common process models in computing. Gender/diversity expertise has been condensed into a number of aspects that characterize the social context of computing research. They can be related to and reflected during every phase. This reflection is somewhat operationalized by providing a list of questions for each combination of phase and aspect. Case studies as part of the model illustrate either in what way such reflections may help in research and development or what may happen if no such aspects have been included.},

abstract = {Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-to-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.},

These methods reflect experience and insights gained from previous INL experiments that have focused on landmine detection and marking; mapping and localization for robot positioning, mobile manipulation for explosive ordinance disposal (EOD), radiation characterization, and urban search and rescue operations. An overarching goal of this work has been to enhance our understanding of how the robot, the control and display interface, the task context, and the human contribute to or hinder mission success. Our approach to performance measurement was developed in concert with the iterative design cycle of our intelligent robotic control system, the robot intelligence kernel (RIK). In extending and refining the RIK for various applications, three factors key to holistic human-robot performance assessment were identified: comprehensive planning; the inclusion of end users in the design and performance evaluation phases of the study; and combining automated data collection with subjective measures. The paper discusses lessons learned in developing and applying performance metrics and provides a brief overview of measures that we are currently using to support the assessment of autonomy. In particular, the paper emphasizes the application of these metrics to behaviors for complex and potentially dangerous missions.},

We believe that the tensions we encountered in our projects, and that we discuss in this paper, might be experienced similarly by other early career researchers. By sharing our tensions, raising our questions, and proposing some preliminary answers to those questions based on our experiences and reflections, we hope to provoke a discussion amongst our dg.o peers that will lead to improved future collaborations, a supportive community environment and, ultimately, smoother Smart City research projects.},

The conclusion from studies illustrate that the complex nature of professional practice in the high risk settings has significant influences upon the fitness for purpose.

abstract = {Industry demand for software developers with knowledge of accessibility has increased substantially in recent years. However, there is little knowledge about the prevalence of higher education teaching about accessibility or faculty's perceived barriers to teaching accessibility. To address this gap, we surveyed 14,176 computing and information science faculty in the United States. We received a representative sample of at least one response from 318 of the 352 institutions we surveyed, totaling 1,857 responses. We found that 175 institutions (50%) had at least one instructor teaching accessibility and that no fewer than 2.5% of faculty overall teach accessibility. Faculty that teach accessibility are twice as likely to be female, to have expertise in HCI and software engineering, and to know people with disabilities. The most critical barriers to teaching accessibility that faculty reported were the absence of clear and discipline-specific accessibility learning objectives and the lack of faculty knowledge about accessibility. Faculty desired resources that were specific to the areas of computing in which they teach rather than general accessibility resources and guidelines.},

They have been described using an instrument specifically created for collecting information about each element of the framework. The proposed framework is composed by the most influential factors/aspects of public service delivery. It has been used for analyzing and comparing the three countries public service delivery. Based on that, some findings and translation to policy recommendations have been done. The paper ends up with a set of policy recommendations on how public services can be improved in different country contexts.},

We identify several processes that can be useful to specifically manage digital platforms for information sharing among users. While this may not be a significant insight, we draw attention for researchers to understand the deployment management of technology, beyond its design, as an important area of research in technology and ethics.},

For this purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not attract much of the users' attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities.},

It departs from other approaches to building context-aware systems where the context is pre-defined by modelling experts not directly involved in the process. The paper focuses on techniques and tools for capturing people-centered context and using it for adapting processes to the needs of human workers. This framework forms the basis for a set of mockups, prototypes and conceptual models developed within SO-PC-Pro, an ongoing EU FP7 "Factories of the Future" research project.},

Recently, multiple and often minimally connected sub-communities of child-robot interaction have started to emerge, variously focusing on the design issues, engineering, and applications of robotic platforms and toolkits. Despite increasing public interest in robots, including robots for children, child-robot interaction research remains highly fragmented and lacks regular cross-disciplinary venues for discussion and dissemination. This workshop will bring together researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds. It will serve as a venue in which to reflect on the current circumstances in which child-robot research is conducted, articulate emerging and "near future" challenges, and discuss actions and tools with which to meet those challenges and consolidate the field.},

abstract = {For years the development of software artifacts was the sole domain of developers and project managers. However, experience has taught us that the users play a very important role in software development and construction. The inclusion of the Domain Experts directly in the development cycle is a very important characteristic of Domain-Specific Languages, as they have often an important role in making and constraining the domain of the language.DSLs are credited with increased productivity and ease of use, but this fact is hardly ever proven. Moreover, Usability tests are frequently only performed at the final stages of the project when changes have a significant impact on the budget. To help prevent this, in this paper we present a pattern language for evaluating the usability of DSLs. These patterns can help show how to use an iterative usability validation development strategy to produce DSLs that can achieve a high degree of Usability.},

We use the Story Completion Method(SCM) to explore commonplace assumptions around futures with sex robots and discuss those from a critical design perspective. Thirty five participants completed a story stem of a human encountering a sex robot or vice-versa. Through thematic analysis, we show narratives of consumerist relation-ships between humans and sex robots, stories that describe sex robots as highly-efficient sex workers that (out)perform humans in routinal sex activities, and narratives that explore sex robots as empathetic and sentient beings. Our participant-created stories both reinforce and challenge established norms of sex robots and raise questions that concern responsible design and ethics in HCI. Finally, we show opportunities and limitations of using multiple-perspective story stems in SCM},

The question is, why? To answer this, we consider three questions and then turn to the nature of answer which might lead towards greater adoption. The first is the vexed question of how good is good enough? The second concerns how best modeling should link through to decision-making; and the third concerns the culture needed to make the most of modeling and simulation (and whether it is worth the effort to make the transformation). From these, we draw an agenda for further enquiry in terms of stakeholders, their culture, data, and expectations, and the case in terms of value.},

However, generating 3D room layouts is a very time-consuming task because it needs complicated manual operations and much technical knowledge. Therefore, we need any tools that help us to easily generate 3D room layouts. The authors have been developing a 3D room layout system that has the following features:1. Analysis of user preference (Conjoint analysis).2. Optimization of 3D room layouts based on Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC).Although IEC is useful for applying the user preferences to the solution, there is a problem about the tiredness of user evaluation operations of IEC process because of the large search space of solutions. To cope with this problem, the authors adopted a prediction method for shrinking the search space and employed a multiscreen interface for reducing the tiredness of each user. In this paper, the authors also justify the usefulness of the system from the experimental results.},

An important aspect of this problem is the collection of data-sets that provide a rich and realistic representation of how people actually socialize with each other in real life. These subtle coordination patterns are influenced by individual beliefs, goals, and, desires related to what an individual stands to lose or gain in the activities they perform in their every day life. These conditions cannot be easily replicated in a lab setting and require a radical re-thinking of both how and what to collect. This tutorial provides a guide on how to create such multi-modal multi-sensor data sets when holistically considering the entire experimental design and data collection process.},

abstract = {Background: Requirement engineering is often considered a critical activity in system development projects. The increasing complexity of software as well as number and heterogeneity of stakeholders motivate the development of methods and tools for improving large-scale requirement engineering. Aims: The empirical study presented in this paper aim to identify and understand the characteristics and challenges of a platform, as desired by experts, to support requirement engineering for individual stakeholders, based on the current pain-points of their organizations when dealing with a large number requirements. Method: We conducted a multiple case study with three companies in different domains. We collected data through ten semi-structured interviews with experts from these companies. Results: The main pain-point for stakeholders is handling the vast amount of data from different sources. The foreseen platform should leverage such data to manage changes in requirements according to customers' and users' preferences. It should also offer stakeholders an estimation of how long a requirements engineering task will take to complete, along with an easier requirements dependency identification and requirements reuse strategy. Conclusions: The findings provide empirical evidence about how practitioners wish to improve their requirement engineering processes and tools. The insights are a starting point for in-depth investigations into the problems and solutions presented. Practitioners can use the results to improve existing or design new practices and tools.},

abstract = {We deployed an autonomous social robotic learning com- panion in three preschool classrooms at an American public school for two months. Before and after this deployment, we asked the teachers and teaching assistants who worked in the classrooms about their views on the use of social robots in preschool education. We found that teachers' expectations about the experience of having a robot in their classrooms often did not match up with their actual experience. These teachers generally expected the robot to be disruptive, but found that it was not, and furthermore, had numerous positive ideas about the robot's potential as a new educational tool for their classrooms. Based on these interviews, we provide a summary of lessons we learned about running child-robot interaction studies in preschools. We share some advice for future researchers who may wish to engage teachers and schools in the course of their own human-robot interaction work. Understanding the teachers, the classroom environment, and the constraints involved is especially important for microgenetic and longitudinal studies, which require more of the school's time-as well as more of the researchers' time-and is a greater opportunity investment for everyone involved.},

In the newest paradigms, cities constitute an environment for implementing innovative actions and promoting the contribution of many stakeholders. Several studies have analysed and assessed the "smart city" as an ecosystem with focus on challenges, performance indicators, and barriers; or have proposed taxonomies for its evaluation and frameworks for its definition. But not much has been done for classifying possible smart cities implementations. The aim of this study is to review and categorise the smart cities developments in the municipality operational areas, to map the implemented initiatives and to propose a living taxonomy of smart cities possible actions. The suggested taxonomy consists of ten primary areas and 85 developments. This study is a first attempt to introduce a comprehensive taxonomy in order to support decision-makers planning the future of their cities as well as to serve as a reference model for the communication among the actors of the quadruple helix towards next developments prioritization.},

We describe a three-dimensional characterization space for software components along with its implementation in a component-based platform for rapidly developing multimodal interfaces. By graphically assembling components, the designer/developer describes the transformation chain from physical devices to tasks and vice-versa. In this context, the key point is to identify generic components that can be reused for different multimodal applications. Nevertheless for flexibility purposes, a mixed approach that enables the designer to use both generic components and tailored components is required. As a consequence, our characterization space includes one axis dedicated to the reusability aspect of a component. The two other axes of our characterization space, respectively depict the role of the component in the data-flow from devices to tasks and the level of specification of the component. We illustrate our three dimensional characterization space as well as the implemented tool based on it using a multimodal map navigator.},

abstract = {There is an increasing demand toward an innovative knowledge-intensive service industry in global business. In particular, the soaring research area of service science, management, and engineering (SSME) emphasizes how people and technology can be effectively aligned to achieve value co-creation between service providers and customers through systematic service innovation. In order to address the problem of the systematic service innovation, this study proposes a machine-metaphor and adaption-metaphor approach to constructing collaborative service system (CSS) which can automate value co-creation experiences using facilitating (or assisting, mediating) the service operation management and improve service productivity and satisfaction. This machine-metaphor approach comprises two parts: simple service machine (SSM) and intelligent service machine (ISM), in which the notion of machines aims at significantly effectuates the productivity in the emergent service/experience economy. In this study, we develop a CSS application: iInteriorDesign that illustrates how a CSS application of innovative knowledge-intensive interior design service can be developed using SSM and ISM. Due to the requirements with massive communications to assure the customers' needs in the interior design service, iInteriorDesign use adaption-metaphor (co-evolutionary technology) to provide the effective decision support on the extraction of the significant interior-design attributes (e.g., romantic, luxurious, etc.) and the optimization of the interior-design concept style selection (e.g., victorian style, minimal &amp; luxury etc.) with a concept style ontology (of the concept style properties like Region, Era, Category, Climate, and Culture) within the interior design services. iInteriorDesign provides a platform that the service participants joint efforts to determine the ideal concept styles of interior design to meet the customer's needs over Internet.Further, the study adopts the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) to evidence if the symbiotic interdependence relationship building can expedite the value co-creation. This study also proposes 'Symbiotic Service Model' based on the RDT to contribute the service innovation research.},

The ten knowledge areas from PMBOK®'s (2013) project management theory were applied to a simulation project, and a management plan was summarized for each area. Using a management plan to conduct the simulation has shown to be effective. Through organization and preparation, we have reduced risk, increased communication, developed two add-on packages for web information systems to manage the communication, effectively utilized resources, and most importantly, established clear project goals and deliverables. The simulation project is still in progress, therefore more comprehensive results are expected at project completion.},

In other cases, it enables new types of collaboration that previously were not possible (e.g. distributed VR). Other systems support tasks that can be performed either individually as well as collaboratively. While these tasks may allow to be performed collaboratively, little has been said on what the benefit is in doing so. We present a user study of a collaborative construction task in a shared physical workspace virtual reality environment under various degrees of interaction in collaboration. Our results show that, for this type of task, a pair of subjects concurrently interacting can be significantly more effective, even though individual user performance decreases. Our results further show that there is no significant benefit in giving only verbal and non-verbal assistance over a single user performing the task.},

abstract = {The changing needs of healthcare provision around the world are forcing service designers and decision makers to adopt new tools in design and evaluation of processes. Apart from the pressure to deliver better services from constrained resources, the increasing use of metrics to monitor and manage care delivery, also means that service providers require a clearer idea of how a service improvement will perform prior to implementation. In turn, this opens up an opportunity for a much greater use of simulation and modeling techniques, provided they can be set within an appropriate framework. This paper discusses and describes a research project aimed at conducting pilot work for developing a framework that facilitates joined up thinking and enables integrative modeling. An approach to achieving such an end is described and progress to date is reported. Since this is an ongoing project, some of the latest results are presented at the conference.},

In tailored, distributed and adaptive environments (spaces), monitoring to ensure this enforcement is especially difficult given the wide spectrum of activities performed and the evolving range of threats. Spaces must be monitored from a multitude of perspectives, each of which will generate a vast quantity of disparate information, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. However, existing security toolsets and offerings are not yet well equipped to analyze these kinds of data with the necessary speed and agility. Big Data technologies, such as Hadoop, enable the analysis of large and unstructured data sources. We propose security operations teams extend their existing security infrastructure with emerging Big Data analytics and Complex Event Processing platforms. To help them do so, we introduce a conceptual blueprint for the analytics solution. We also present an Orchestrated Analytical Security operational and organizational framework that helps organizations understand how analytical security not only provides monitoring but also creates actionable intelligence from data.},

It exposes to the end users modern Web-based tools relying on a sophisticated infrastructure to collect, enrich, annotate, and search through large document corpora. Supporting researchers in their daily work is a novel concern for infrastructures. We describe how we gathered requirements through multiple methods to understand historians’ needs and derive an abstract workflow to support them. We then outline the tools that we have built, tying their technical descriptions to the user requirements. The main tools are the note-taking environment and its faceted search capabilities; the data integration platform including the Data API, supporting semantic enrichment through entity recognition; and the environment supporting the software development processes throughout the project to keep both technical partners and researchers in the loop. The outcomes are technical together with new resources developed and gathered, and the research workflow that has been described and documented.},

abstract = {The timely identification of deficiencies in cognitive functions, such as attention problems, are of vital importance for children to acquire skills such as literacy. However, today, the application of psychometric tests for the identification of attention problems takes place when children already have symptoms, or problems associated with the development of their learning. So, an early detection in the preschool age is of vital importance for their optimal development. The use of serious games and interactive interfaces for the detection and therapy of problems related to learning has helped to obtain better results according to the studies analyzed in the related work. In this work we propose proposed to identify deficiencies in cognitive functions for preschool children, using a serious game and a control interface that provides a natural interaction. Following the first stages of the experimental research methodology, the methodology of soft systems, the incremental model of software development and the rapid contextual design technique, a prototype of interactive interface was obtained and the proposal of a serious game with the necessary characteristics for performing tests to detect deficiencies in cognitive functions.},

With the fictional job postings, we triggered discussions with stakeholders from a production site and with the public -- which both resulted in highly controversial debates. In this note, we present the evolution of an exemplary job posting and the reactions it evoked. We then discuss our learnings (e.g., that the degree of fiction is essential) and conclude by reflecting on how this instrument facilitates the exploration of prospective interactive practices at work.},

The experience evaluation study demonstrated how the novice versus expert profiles of interaction behaviours influenced the nature of the artwork experience.

However, recent studies have revealed that the use of AI speakers decreases over time, which shows that current agents do not fully support smart homes. Because of this problem, the possibility of unobtrusive, invisible intelligence without a physical device has been suggested. To explore CA design direction that enhances the user experience in smart homes, we aimed to understand each feature by comparing an invisible agent with visible ones embedded in stand-alone AI speakers. We conducted a drawing study to examine users' mental models formed through communicating with two different physical entities (i.e., visible and invisible CAs). From the drawings, interviews, and surveys, we identified how users' mental models and interactions differed depending on the presence of a physical entity. We found that a physical entity affected users' perceptions, expectations, and interactions toward the agent.},

They then walk through the scenario and brainstorm new design alternatives that reflect the design principle in question. This combination of structured walkthroughs with focused brainstorming helps designers, particularly those with little social science background, to generate concrete, actionable ideas that reflect key findings from the social science literature. We taught Generative Walkthroughs in ten courses with over 220 students and found that technically-trained students not only learned these socio-technical principles, but were able to apply them in innovative ways in a variety of design settings.},

SIRE-ML builds on the foundation of coordination theory, and incorporates important semantic information about the systems integration domain. The article develops constructs in SIRE-ML, and a merge algorithm that allows both functional managers and integration professionals to contribute to building a systems integration solution. Integration models built with SIRE-ML provide benefits such as ensuring coverage and minimizing ambiguity, and can be used to drive implementation with different platforms such as middleware, services, and distributed objects. We evaluate SIRE-ML for ontological expressiveness and report findings about applicability check with an expert panel. The article discusses implications for future research such as tool building and empirical evaluation, as well as implications for practice.},

To build high quality ontologies, developers are required to choose and follow a suitable methodology containing a series of steps, activities and guidelines organized in a systematic way. In this paper, we develop guidelines on how to select ontology merging or integration which has not been explored in any ontology research. As it is more cost effective to build an ontology reusing existing ontologies (integration and merging) than from scratch, we therefore propose an ontology development methodology, MIOD, which incorporates and performs ontology integration in its development process. A semi-automatic key term evaluation system is developed to find suitable source ontologies from a group of candidate ontologies. The proposed methodology and system are used to address the insufficiency of current ontology development and integration methodologies.},

In this paper, we take stock of 18 years of CCI research by conducting a systematic literature study exploring how and to what extent ethics has been dealt with in the community's leading venues: the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference and the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI). Searching all papers in the IDC conference proceedings and IJCCI, 157 papers were found that use the word stem 'ethic*'. Based on our analysis of these papers, our study demonstrates that while ethics is frequently mentioned, the literature remains underdeveloped in a number of areas including definition and theoretical basis, the reporting of formal ethical approval procedures, and the extent to which design and participation ethics is dealt with. Based on our study we provide five avenues of future research in the interests of developing a more explicit discourse on ethics in CCI.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use design fiction to explore the social implications for adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). We argue that existing speculations about BCIs are incomplete: they discuss fears about radical changes in types of control, at the expense of discussing more traditional types of power that emerge in everyday experience, particularly via labor. We present a design fiction in which a BCI technology creates a new type of menial labor, using workers' unconscious reactions to assist algorithms in performing a sorting task. We describe how such a scenario could unfold through multiple sites of interaction: the design of an API, a programmer's question on StackOverflow, an internal memo from a dating company, and a set of forum posts about laborers' experience using the designed system. Through these fictions, we deepen and expand conversations around what kinds of (everyday) futures BCIs could create.},

Despite increasing interest among researchers, there is still a lack of consistent community norms around ethical gray areas. One charge of the SIGCHI ethics committee is to help develop these norms by facilitating open conversations with different stakeholders. This panel will be an opportunity to develop a collective understanding of diverse perspectives on ethics, and to gather input from the GROUP research community around the ethical challenges we face as researchers who study social and collaborative computing systems and those who use these systems.},

Such a focus includes projects that involve users in the design of algorithms and "human-in-the-loop" systems, broader investigations into the ways in which "participation" is situated in data-driven activities, as well as conceptual concerns about participation's changing contours in contemporary social computing landscapes. This one- day workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers and sets out to achieve three goals: identify cases and ongoing projects on the topic of participation in algorithmic ecosystems; create a tactical toolkit of key challenges and strategies in this space; and set a forward-facing agenda to provoke further attention to the changing role of participation in contemporary sociotechnical systems.},

This panel brings together CSCW scholars active in theorizations and enactments of design for social justice to examine and debate social change oriented research.

The rise of large scale labor analytics raises questions about how and whether workers could use such data to advocate for their own goals. Here, we analyze the historical development of workplace technology design methods in CSCW to show how mid-20th century labor responses to scientific management can inform directions in contemporary digital labor advocacy. First, we demonstrate how specific methodological tendencies from industrial scientific management were adapted to work in CSCW, and then subsequently altered in crowd work and social computing research to more closely resemble industrial approaches. Next, we show how three tactics used by labor unions to strategically engage with industrial scientific management in the mid-20th century can inform data-driven worker advocacy in platform-mediated work. Finally, we discuss how this history shapes our understanding of worker participation and the implications of using worker data for contemporary advocacy goals.},

This research project pursues to what extent this process can be technically supported or improved. In the first step, user-centered and participative methods were used to identify the problems together with first-year students, and an onboarding concept was developed. In the second step, the concept was technically implemented and evaluated with quantitative and qualitative research methods. 102 freshmen participated in the following chatbot-based onboarding scavenger hunt, which had a strong focus on network building between the new students. The 12-day onboarding scavenger hunt was conducted at the beginning of the winter semester 2019 with computer science freshmen at the University of Vienna. The evaluation results revealed that the students felt more familiar with the faculty building and the university campus after the scavenger hunt, also met other students, made new friends, and, by participating, their sense of belonging to the student community became stronger.},

However, such collaborations often face challenges. In this paper, we aim to decipher this collaboration complexity through a semi-structured interview study with 22 interviewees from teams of bio-medical scientists collaborating with data scientists. In the analysis, we adopt the Olsons' four-dimensions framework proposed in Distance Matters to code interview transcripts. Our findings suggest that besides the glitches in the collaboration readiness, technology readiness, and coupling of work dimensions, the tensions that exist in the common ground building process influence the collaboration outcomes, and then persist in the actual collaboration process. In contrast to prior works' general account of building a high level of common ground, the breakdowns of content common ground together with the strengthen of process common ground in this process is more beneficial for scientific discovery. We discuss why that is and what the design suggestions are, and conclude the paper with future directions and limitations.},

Mokap aims to address two specific challenges: provide support for early development stage design and facilitate involvement of domain experts. More specifically, on the one hand, it aims to make serious game authoring possible for people with no technical background. On the other hand, Mokap provides explicit support for activities related to analysis and design, especially useful during the early stages of development. In this sense, Mokap aims to facilitate the transition from the designers' board to the programmers' environment and also to enhance communication between the different roles of the development team. Developed as an open source environment, Mokap is oriented to mobile devices (tablets and smartphones), a kind of technology most educational stakeholders are familiar with. We present the main design concepts behind Mokap, along with some technical insight into the platform and the description of the game Listen With Lemur as a case study.},

abstract = {Grand challenges are significant themes that can bring together researchers to bring significant change to a field. In 2012 a new initiative to restart the debate on major grand challenges for modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) began. Leading researchers have presented M&amp;S Grand Challenges in areas such as ubiquitous simulation, high performance computing, spatial simulation, big simulation, human behaviour, multi-domain design, systems engineering, cyber systems, network simulation and education. To contribute further to this initiative, this paper presents M&amp;S Grand Challenges from an Operational Research/Management Science (OR/MS) perspective and discusses themes including simulation in healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based simulation and simulation analytics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the preservation of original semantic similarity among objects when dimensional reduction is applied on the original data source and a further clustering process is performed on dimensionally reduced data. An experiment is designed to test Baire, or longest common prefix ultrametric, and K-Means when prior random projection is applied. A data matrix extracted from a cultural heritage database has been prepared for the experiment. Given that the random projection produces a vector with components ranging on the interval [0, 1], clusters are obtained at different precision levels. Next, the mean semantic similarity of clusters is calculated using a modified version of the Jaccard index. Our findings show that semantics is difficult to preserve by these methods. However, a Student's hypothesis test on mean similarity indicates that Baire clusters objects are semantically better than K-Means when we increase the digit precision, but paying an increasing cost for orphan clustered objects. Despite this cost, it is argued that the ultrametric technique provides an efficient process to detect semantic homogeneity on the original data space.},

Designers and engineers have also become increasingly aware of ways in which the artifacts they create can embody political, social, and ethical values. Despite such an awareness, there has been little work towards producing practical methodologies that systematically incorporate values into the design process. Many designers struggle to find a balance between their own values, those of users and other stakeholders, and those of the surrounding culture. In this paper, we present the RAPUNSEL project as a case study of game design in a values-rich context and describe our efforts toward navigating the complexities this entails. Additionally, we present initial steps toward the development of a systematic methodology for discovery, analysis, and integration of values in technology design in the hope that others may both benefit from and build upon this work.},

This paper presents an aviation domain ontology, the ICARUS ontology, which aims at facilitating the semantic description and integration of information resources that represent the various assets of the ICARUS platform and their use. To present the functionality and usability of the proposed ontology, we present the results of querying the ontology using SPARQL queries through three use case scenarios. As shown from the evaluation, the ICARUS ontology enables the integration and reasoning over multiple sources of heterogeneous aviation-related data, the semantic description of metadata produced by ICARUS, and their storage in a knowledge-base which is dynamically updated and provides access to its contents via SPARQL queries.},

These advances bring about opportunities to redefine building skins as interactive components with significant impact on the environmental and aesthetic dimensions of architecture. However, current modeling and analysis software systems largely consider building materials as static entities, making the design and assessment of programmable responsive surfaces (such as surfaces of variable optical transmittance) considerably difficult. Expanding on our previous innovative research on organic electrochromic smart windows as architectural components (Cardoso Llach et al. 2009), we report on a new simulation environment, Acacia, for the design and analysis of highly responsive building facades. Unique to Acacia is its capacity to enable the modeling and assessment of fa\c{c}ade behaviors in response to both environmental and human inputs.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the role of a telecentre project- the Union Digital Centres (UDC) in Bangladesh- in developing entrepreneurship among rural youths under Public-Private Partnership. Contrary to engaging qualified operators in terms of efficiency and investment the UDC has employed local youths who are small scale investors, home grown and amateur in skill. Many operators earn very low and some run off the project leading to closure of centres. In this context understanding the issue of entrepreneurship attains significance for the sustainability of the model. Entrepreneurship is defined in terms of operator's income, his/her satisfaction on income and the level of investment. The study hypothesizes that factors responsible for entrepreneurship development include ICT and internet, services, clients' turnout, stakeholders' involvement and experience of the operator. Based on an internet survey and interview of operators and a review of literature the study explores features of UDC facilitated entrepreneurship. It describes stakeholders' involvement in ensuring inputs and their roles in promoting entrepreneurship. An application of a structural equation model supports the hypotheses validating that operator's own initiative synergized with support from the government influence the development of entrepreneurship among operators. The results specify that the UDC bears potential to develop entrepreneurship among operators given they use a variety of equipment and better quality internet, provide a range of services to a greater volume of clients, receive stakeholder's support and demonstrate computer and managerial skills. The government's role in implementation, human resource management and monitoring of the project influences the process. The study also finds that the project experiences a range of challenges from inadequate involvement of partners. Since deficiency in any partner's role can affect the mission of entrepreneurship development, the author suggests that the government must take the lead role in engaging relevant partners to convert the UDC as an enterprise.},

Digital games are increasingly prevalent in today's classrooms, and game-based learning is emerging as a successful means of reaching students who often struggle to succeed through more traditional approaches. For example, students with autism face a unique set of challenges and goals in the context of classroom learning. Principles of well-designed games offer a powerful framework for designing new types of learning experiences for students with autism. Moreover, recent innovations in computing interfaces have also lead to new forms of socio-collaborative experiences with digital media. This article introduces our recent case study in applying game-based learning in Special Education. We will present the learning scenario goals and implementation, focusing on how this work successfully applied well-designed game principles to this context.

abstract = {Wicked problems are immensely complex problems that do not lend themselves to resolution through traditional problem-solving approaches. This capriciousness is particularly troublesome for organizations that encounter such problems due to their very nature being highly prone to fluctuation. Further, any attempts to resolve wicked problems tend to be irreversible --- for better or for worse. Decision support systems (DSSs) have long been hailed as a panacea of sorts for highly complex problems due to their ability to assist in storing, retrieving, and manipulating information to arrive at a decision. However, traditional DSSs, being originally aimed at semi-structured problems, are rendered almost ineffectual in the face of the high levels of complexity inherent in wicked problems. Consequently, this paper outlines the argument that posits procedural rationality as an alternative underlying mechanism for developing DSSs for wicked problems. An empirical literature review is utilized to locate the required characteristics of such a DSS, to evaluate cognizance thereof in the research, and to present an integrated model for the design, development, and utilisation of procedural DSSs specifically for resolution of wicked problems.},

abstract = {Software Design Patterns (SDPs) are core solutions to the recurring problems in software. However, adopting SDPs without taking into account their value implications may result in breach of social values and ultimately lead to user dissatisfaction, lack of adoption, and financial loss. An example is the airline system that overcharged people who were trying to escape from the Hurricane Irma. Although not intentional, overlsight of social values in the design of the airline system resulted in significant customer dissatisfaction and loss of trust. To mitigate such value breaches in software design we propose taking social values into account in SDPs explicitly. To achieve this, we outline a collaborative framework that allows for (i) specifying the value implications of SDPs, (ii) developing or extending SDPs for integrating social values, (iii) providing guidance on the value-conscious adoption of design patterns, (iv) collecting and analyzing insights from collaborators, (v) maintaining an up-to-date library of the valufied design patterns, and (vi) incorporating lessons learned from the real-world adoption of the valuefied design patterns into the proposed framework for its continuous improvement in integrating social values into software.},

abstract = {Architects substantially develop their ideas in space through a visual apprehension of spatial relations. Bodily experience fundamentally influences architects' way of thinking during the design process in terms of perception of the space, bodily interaction with the physical environment, the mental imagery constructed in ones' mind and recollection of spatial data. We argue that the exploration of gestural and kinesthetic interaction between the designers and their design models provides an enhanced understanding of how traditional design environments provide for facilities intuitive interaction between designers and their design models. As an attempt to understand how the bodily experience influences the development of spatial ideas, we aim to explore the impact of gestural and kinesthetic interactions on designers' spatial thinking during the architectural design process by a case study where we analyze students' presentation of architectural design ideas.},

abstract = {Smartphone-based applications are increasingly being used to combat unhealthy habits resulting in obesity or reduced physical mobility. In turn, gamification has been identified as a useful tool to motivate individuals towards behavioural change. However, both health professionals and game developers are currently working on island solutions addressing individual problems due to the lack of efficient frameworks enabling cooperation in this domain. This has resulted in a large number of mHealth apps, each using different motivational techniques, metrics and health data. In this paper we propose a unified user-centred framework which is capable of running third-party developer's apps within a sandbox. Using this approach, we can mitigate often voiced privacy and safety concerns and simultaneously tailor health-interventions using content from developers as well as user preferences and environment in order to facilitate internalisation of healthy lifestyles. Apart from this, we provide indications for operationalizing our conceptual framework in future work.},

To assist designers, three types of contextual dynamism are distinguished: physical, ontological and social. To inform understanding ontological dynamism and social dynamism, "social contraptions" - a form of socially interactive design experimentation is proposed. This paper focuses on cryanic social contraptions in which unseen users interact through a human surrogate that they guide via radio transmissions. Observations from initial trials are reported along with a discussion of themes arising for design and an appraisal of this approach's potential as a design tool.},

abstract = {Researchers in human-centered computing have surfaced a feminist ethic of care in interaction with technologies, in data collection, and in data work. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. We discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. We conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small.},

abstract = {Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the "Ostrom Workshop." A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a "constitutional layer" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.},

We extracted 139 papers on depression, anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.},

abstract = {Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into the workplace, impacting organizational structures and processes, and affecting products and services created by these organizations. While robots promise significant benefits to organizations, their introduction poses a variety of design challenges. In this paper, we use ethnographic data collected at a hospital using an autonomous delivery robot to examine how organizational factors affect the way its members respond to robots and the changes engendered by their use. Our analysis uncovered dramatic differences between the medical and post-partum units in how people integrated the robot into their workflow and their perceptions of and interactions with it. Different patient profiles in these units led to differences in workflow, goals, social dynamics, and the use of the physical environment. In medical units, low tolerance for interruptions, a discrepancy between the perceived cost and benefits of using the robot, and breakdowns due to high traffic and clutter in the robot's path caused the robot to have a negative impact on the workflow and staff resistance. On the contrary, post-partum units integrated the robot into their workflow and social context. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines for the development of robots for organizations.},

From airline cockpits to distributed groupware systems, scholars emphasize the importance of supporting a multitude of tasks and creating technologies that integrate into collaborative work settings. More recent scholarship highlights a growing need to consider the concerns of workers within and beyond established workplace settings or roles of employment, from steelworkers whose jobs have been eliminated with post-industrial shifts in the economy to contractors performing the content moderation that shapes our social media experiences. This one-day workshop seeks to bring together a growing community of HCI scholars concerned with the labor upon which the future of work we envision relies. We will discuss existing methods for studying work that we find both productive and problematic, with the aim of understanding how we might better bridge current gaps in research, policy, and practice. Such conversations will focus on the challenges associated with taking a worker-oriented approach and outline concrete methods and strategies for conducting research on labor in changing industrial, political, and environmental contexts.},

abstract = {Depictions of robots and AIs in popular science fiction movies and shows have the potential to showcase visions of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to the general public and computer science researchers alike. In contrast, studies on the referral, usage, and appropriation of these portrayals by computer scientists in their research publications is an academic void at present. However, such investigations are critical to better understand the potential utility and latent shortcomings of science fiction robots for future HRI research, innovation, and education. To address this research gap, this study investigates the overall presence, nature, and frequency of referrals of 18 popular science fiction robots in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library. These robots were either portrayed in various movies and subsequently inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame, created by Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, or were top-ranked in a user-curated Internet Movie Database (IMDB) list. To do so, we performed full-text search and retrieval queries of all 18 robots in the ACM Digital Library. In total, we identified 121 relevant mentions, across 102 individual publications, in a time span from 1973 to 2017. These 121 mentions were then qualitatively analysed to determine the nature of the robot mentions. Our results indicate that the robot attributes of voice or dialogue were emerging as a popularly mentioned element. In addition, we find that research papers of philosophical nature mention sci-fi robots more frequently than papers of technical or theoretical nature. We also observe that the dystopian element of science fiction is under-utilised, with the majority of robot mentions exhibiting neutral or utopian characteristics. In conclusion, we speculate on our results and present possible avenues of future HRI research on the topic.},

The goal of this workshop is, therefore, to advance CSCW research by raising awareness for the ongoing challenges and open questions around civic technology by bridging the gap between researchers and practitioners from different regions.The workshop will be organized around three central topics: (1) discuss how the local context and infrastructure affect the design, implementation, adoption, and maintenance of civic technology; (2) identify key elements of the configuration of trust among government, citizenry, and local organizations and how these elements change depending on the sociopolitical context where community engagement takes place; (3) discover what methods and strategies are best suited for conducting research on civic technologies in different contexts. These core topics will be covered across sessions that will initiate in-depth discussions and, thereby, stimulate collaboration between the CSCW research community and practitioners of civic technologies from both Global North and South.},

abstract = {We present a collaborative tool for choreographers and dancers, the Choreographer's Notebook, which allows multimodal annotation of rehearsal videos during the dance production process. The dance production process is a creative process in which exploration and expression are paramount and we describe issues we have observed over four different dance production cycles. The Choreographer's Notebook addresses the recurring problem of scarcity of rehearsal time and space, which is a limiting factor for exploration and expression. The tool is a web-based video application that enables choreographers to provide multimodal, context-sensitive instructions and feedback to the dancers outside of formal rehearsal time. The novelty of this tool is its ability to provide a multimodal collaborative video-based workflow. This article also presents a thorough ethnographic investigation of the dance production process and results from the use of the Choreographer's Notebook as an artifact within that process.},

abstract = {Recent disasters have highlighted the gap between existing urbancentric resilience models and the needs of rural communities, which are frequently marginalized. Large rural constituencies, encompassing vast and sparsely populated areas, lack broadband connectivity and rely predominantly on volunteer-based emergency workforce. The above are some of the key factors hampering rural first responders? ability to access, act upon and disseminate emergency-related information. This has an adverse effect on both residents and the agencies that serve them, as it limits residents? ability to prepare for emergencies and compromises the safety of first responders. Furthermore, the unique socio-economic structure of rural areas makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of incipient or unfolding disasters. Hence, rural communities often develop self-reliance capabilities by creating tightknit social structures and taking charge of their own technological progress through community-driven efforts.},

abstract = {This paper presents ACKTUS, a semantic web platform for modeling and managing knowledge integrated in support systems for health care, and for designing the interaction with the end user applications. A key purpose is to allow the domain experts to collaboratively model the knowledge content and tailor interaction to users. Therefore, the development has been done in a process of participatory action research where domain experts have contributed to the design and re-design of ACKTUS while they have been modeling the content and behavior of end-user applications. The ontology that serves as the knowledge structure in the system integrates the user model, modality values, clinical practice guidelines and preferences, in the form of schemes and scheme-nodes (arguments) in an argumentation framework, partly by integrating the argument interchange format. User studies have shown that ACKTUS can be used for the intended purpose by domain professionals not familiar with knowledge engineering tasks. Moreover, the platform functions as a research infrastructure for health researchers in their development and evaluation of new ICT-based interventions targeting improved health.},

abstract = {Engineering software-intensive systems is a complex process that typically involves making many critical decisions. A continuous challenge during system design, analysis and development is deciding on the reference architecture that could reduce risks and deliver the expected functionality and quality of a product or a service to its users. The lack of evidence in documenting strategies supporting decision-making in the selection of architectural assets in systems and software engineering creates an impediment in learning, improving and also reducing the risks involved. In order to fill this gap, ten experienced researchers in the field of decision support for the selection of architectural assets in engineering software-intensive systems conducted a workshop to reduce traceability of strategies and define a dedicated taxonomy. The result was the GRADE taxonomy, whose key elements can be used to support decision-making as exemplified through a real case instantiation for validation purposes. The overall aim is to support future work of researchers and practitioners in decision-making in the context of architectural assets in the development of software-intensive systems. The taxonomy may be used in three ways: (i) identify new opportunities in structuring decisions; (ii) support the review of alternatives and enable informed decisions; and (iii) evaluate decisions by describing in a retrospective fashion decisions, factors impacting the decision and the outcome.},

Although technology-mediated personalised learning is promising, several challenges remain such as how personalised learning should be conceptualized, which methods should be used to establish the effects and how this movement impacts education and especially children and teachers.

Conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.},

abstract = {Project schedule delay is a major problem in many projects. It has major consequences and effects on project cost, customer satisfaction level, market share and company reputation. Schedule delay factors can be expressed as direct or indirect causes of schedule delay. Developing an acquisition frame to study schedule delay is a need for any analytic process and there was no such generic model developed to analyze many projects at once regardless of their uniqueness. (Data Acquisition Model) DAM is the way which includes schedule delay factors selected from academic and practical field experience. DAM grouped schedule delay factors according to project life cycle level. EPC lifecycle is known as (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) phases of project life cycle. Some factors were not related to EPC, so adding a criteria using (general) was informative to group non-EPC factors. Shortlisting schedule delay factors in each group was achieved through another criteria (selection criteria). As a conclusion based on the literature review and our practical experience the model might be novel to address schedule delay problem in projects. Data mining techniques have been widely utilized in many industries to extract hidden descriptive or implicit knowledge. A framework was developed based on two main models (hybrid KDD Model) and (Fayyad Model) to discover knowledge in data. DAM might be starting point for (DM) techniques; to generate knowledge about schedule delay factors that will help many decision makers to take corrective action items and control schedule delays in projects.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a coordinated push for automation in Smart Factories and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The increasing complexity of frequently changing production environments challenges shop floor workers to perform well. The tasks they work on are getting less routine and ask for continuous knowledge and skills development. For example, the skills portfolio of workers likely requires improved higher-order thinking and decision-making skills. A wide range of research and development efforts already today sets focus on different areas of workplace learning, including performance appraisals, pedagogy and education, technology, and business economics. Bridging the skills gap, however, requires novel user-facing technologies -- such as Augmented Reality (AR) and wearables -- for human performance augmentation to improve efficiency and effectiveness of staff delivered through live guidance. AR branches out beyond mobile apps with 3D-object superimposition for marketing purposes to rather complex use cases delivered by a rapidly growing innovation ecosystem of hard- and software providers collaborating closely with R&amp;D organisations. This paper provides a first shared vision on how AR can tackle four different challenges related to handling complexity in a CPS environment: develop intelligent assistance systems for learning and performance assessment at the workplace, adapt job profiles accordingly, and last but not least to address also the issue of work-life balance. The paper concludes with an outline of a research roadmap.},

Based on an observational study grounded in the reality-based interaction framework, we identified power vs. reality tradeoffs that can be addressed to find a close fit to embodied practice. Using this knowledge, we designed and implemented a digital workspace for supporting affinity diagramming. Its hybrid interaction techniques combine digital pen &amp; paper with an interactive table and tangible tokens. An additional vertical display is used to support reflection-in-action and for enhancing discussion and coordination. A preliminary user study confirmed the applicability of our tradeoffs and the general acceptance of the tool design.},

However, their descriptions usually contain too many details related to personal characteristics and too little information relevant to the software that will be developed. This may limit their use and acceptance. In this context, the PATHY technique was proposed. It uses guiding questions to create personas more focused on the design of applications. In this paper, we present an experimental study where the technique was integrated with user stories. The study aims at evaluating the participants' perception regarding the structure of the technique and analyzing the requirements generated when using PATHY in a software development process. The results showed that, although the participants found some difficulties, they considered the technique useful for creating personas. Furthermore, it helped in the identification of requirements used as basis for the elaboration of user stories.},

abstract = {Given the focus of professional graduate ICT programs on technical and managerial skills, pedagogical engagement with external organizations tends to be transactional and artifact-centered. This inhibits the students' ability to understand social, technical and ethical issues in context, or to develop affective relationships with users and other stakeholders. To address this, we designed a service learning course that partnered students with non-profit organizations to help with their technology challenges. The service project was deliberately left open-ended to force students (and partners) to tackle important questions around project scoping and impact. By drawing parallels to soil care practices, we explore how "care time" emerged in this context, and how the incorporation of ambiguity galvanized students, community, and faculty to make time to navigate it. This led to non-tangible yet vital outcomes such as overcoming social limitations, building symbiotic relationships, and enacting acts of care necessary for more ethical orchestration of technology.},

This article extends Dourish's work to introduce the human-computer interaction community to ideas related to Merleau-Ponty's concept of the lived body. It also provides a detailed analysis of two related topics: (1) embodied perception: the active and embodied nature of perception, including the body's ability to extent its sensory apparatus through digital technology; and (2) kinaesthetic creativity: the body's ability to relate in a direct and creative fashion with the “feel” dimension of interactive products during the design process.},

To accomplish this, design in digital civics emphasizes the importance of relationships based on dialogue, empowerment, and participation; all of which are contingent upon the existence of trust. Currently, however, these relationships are most often characterized by entrenched distrust which problematizes opportunities for dialogue and participation. In this paper, we explore how design might support trust in the relational aims of digital civics. To do so, we led 13 public officials in a large US city through a design-based inquiry centered around the role of trust in their various efforts to engage communities. In our findings, we discuss four strategies for supporting trust in digital civics.},

To assist designers in the design process of on-body companion robots, we surveyed users' expectations towards on-body companion robots (n=215) by a questionnaire constituting of questions on factors that may affect robot acceptance, including robot functionality, robot appearance, and robot social ability. Based on the survey results, we stated design guidelines for the design of on-body companion robots supporting designers with insights into users. To demonstrate how to design on-body companion robots based on our findings, we organized a workshop with experienced designers to develop a conceptual on-body companion robot, and they proposed Bubo, an example prototype of on-body companion robot.},

abstract = {George Santayana's statement, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," is only half true. The past also includes successful histories. If you haven't been made aware of them, you're often condemned not to repeat their successes.In a rapidly expanding field such as software engineering, this happens a lot. Extensive studies of many software projects such as the Standish Reports offer convincing evidence that many projects fail to repeat past successes.This paper tries to identify at least some of the major past software experiences that were well worth repeating, and some that were not. It also tries to identify underlying phenomena influencing the evolution of software engineering practices that have at least helped the author appreciate how our field has gotten to where it has been and where it is.A counterpart Santayana-like statement about the past and future might say, "In an era of rapid change, those who repeat the past are condemned to a bleak future." (Think about the dinosaurs, and think carefully about software engineering maturity models that emphasize repeatability.)This paper also tries to identify some of the major sources of change that will affect software engineering practices in the next couple of decades, and identifies some strategies for assessing and adapting to these sources of change. It also makes some first steps towards distinguishing relatively timeless software engineering principles that are risky not to repeat, and conditions of change under which aging practices will become increasingly risky to repeat.},

abstract = {With data revolution, data is emerging as a new raw material. As the importance of data has increased, interest in the availability of public sector information (PSI) has also grown. PSI created in the public sector comprises public attributes and directly impacts national administration and citizen's lives.Korea has almost the highest level of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and considerable data through government-led policies. As a result of such policies, Korea has demonstrated excellent results in the United Nation's e-government survey, ITU's ICT development index, and OECD's public data openness index. Paradoxically, however, this history and experience is a stumbling block to a new era. PSI, which is a basic resource for realizing the value of openness, sharing, cooperation, and communication, should be actively managed and opened by government to provide support for reuse in the sense that the government is its main producer and manager. However, no matter how good the quality of PSI through data management is and how excellent policies and institutions are established, if the private sector cannot actively use it, it is useless. What is the role of government and law in the context of changing the way data is managed and blurring sectoral boundaries?This paper aims to propose core challenges by analyzing the case of Korea in order to derive a basis for discussions to coordinate public and private cooperation and legal relations in the process. To begin with, we analyze the changes in the management environment of data and PSI and identify the role of government and law in responding to changes in the legal rights. Then, we discuss how Korea responds to change, examines related policies by function and discussions on the data law, which seem to have the greatest effect on government's role, and suggests essential tasks to change its role accordingly.},

abstract = {Negotiation support systems (NSS) can enhance humans' performance in negotiations. Much research in this area focuses on finding optimal bids. However, there is little research on human factors in technological negotiation support. We believe an in-depth analysis of the task involving experts and users is needed to build a new generation of NSS focusing on man-machine collaboration. We describe a scenario-based approach to gathering requirements for such a system. We wrote five scenarios containing part of the envisioned functionality in the most important use situations, e.g. face-to-face negotiation, on the phone, collaborative or mobile preparation. We used claims analysis to clarify our design decisions. To evaluate our claims we organized focus groups including six general and six job negotiation experts. The filmed scenarios were used together with two claims each to guide the discussion. Based on the data analysis we constructed 12 design guidelines for NSS.},

It discusses some of the lessons learned from actual design, research and education, focussing on design as a exploratory process of mashing-up functions, services and presentations in the context learning by doing: doing research, doing design and doing learning from each other.Finally, having discussed the consequences of a Human Centred Creative Technology approach for design and for education, the main part of the paper discusses the content issues behind the developments in the area of HCI ad Media technology. This part discusses a number of attempts from the litterature to describe the developments, the need to identify a set of independent causal factors behind the developments, and the process and its results to arrive at a set of factors which help to understand, teach and anticipate the development from the desktop-oriented generation towards the ubiquitous, sensitive, smart, tangible, and networked ICT generation of the future.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering is one of the most critical phases in the context of software development. Unclear textual specifications of requirements, hidden dependencies between requirements, and suboptimal prioritizations and release plans represent the major reasons for project delays and even cancellation. In this paper, we show how group recommender user interfaces can help to improve the quality of requirements engineering processes. To that end, we developed a novel group recommendation approach that focuses on the aspect of improving requirements prioritization by making preference elicitation processes more flexible as well as by introducing innovative user interfaces that foster information exchange among stakeholders. We conducted a large user study (N=313 participants) to evaluate our approach. The evaluation results indicate that argumentation-based user interfaces in a group setting trigger more rating and communication activity among the group members which significantly improves the quality of the prioritization process. Our main contributions are twofold: (1) more flexibility of the requirements evaluation by supporting the delegation of votes to experts and (2) an increased engagement of the stakeholders responsible for the requirements.},

We define Fab Form as any design representation that lends itself to interactive customization by a novice user, while remaining valid and manufacturable. We propose a method to achieve these Fab Form requirements for general parametric designs tagged with a general set of automated validity tests and a small number of parameters exposed to the casual user. Our solution separates Fab Form evaluation into a precomputation stage and a runtime stage. Parts of the geometry and design validity (such as manufacturability) are evaluated and stored in the precomputation stage by adaptively sampling the design space. At runtime the remainder of the evaluation is performed. This allows interactive navigation in the valid regions of the design space using an automatically generated Web user interface (UI). We evaluate our approach by converting several parametric models into corresponding Fab Forms.},

As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.},

The paper provides background context on the development of IoT technologies and how these developments overlap with industry, enabling revolutionary changes such as Industry 4.0 and the advent of the Industrial Internet. The emergence of IoT technologies, IoT enabled industry and IoT influenced social change are discussed, highlighting the new requirements and production demands that are emerging for integrated communications, features and systems.The paper introduces a new end-to-end and framework for enterprise planning, adoption and deployment of a feature rich and integrated Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) system within a multinational enterprise. The new framework presents a multi-domain structure with four primary modular containers. This structured model introduces new concepts of a Core Governance Domain (CGD), Operational Management Domain (OMD), Unified Services Domain (USD) and Integrated Feature Domain (IFD). Combined these domains represent a coherent framework that supports initial deployment and planning, ongoing sustain and technical agile technical architecture.

Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.},

abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing system in which tasks are distributed to a population of thousands of anonymous workers for completion. This system is increasingly popular with researchers and developers. Here we extend previous studies of the demographics and usage behaviors of MTurk workers. We describe how the worker population has changed over time, shifting from a primarily moderate-income, U.S.-based workforce towards an increasingly international group with a significant population of young, well-educated Indian workers. This change in population points to how workers may treat Turking as a full-time job, which they rely on to make ends meet.},

abstract = {Social media platforms provide active communication channels during mass convergence and emergency events such as disasters caused by natural hazards. As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings. We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.},

abstract = {User-created guides, or the "do-it-yourself" (DIY) genre of online procedural discourse, offer their audience access to vital knowledge while allowing them to bypass traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. Some vulnerable communities must further subvert or "hack" institutions to gain access to information that they need to survive exclusive or oppressive policies. In this article, we present original data in an effort to legitimize the work these communities have done while also challenging the boundaries of what constitutes successful design. Edenfield shares his research of medical information-sharing practices of DIY hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for trans individuals. Ledbetter's study of YouTube's beauty community involved collecting and analyzing user-generated makeup tutorials on YouTube as well as interviewing women who self-identify as members of the community. Both studies prompt a reconsideration of what it means to create successful instructional guides. We suggest strategies for avoiding institutional appropriation of these communities' work and for identifying community spaces and the borders that can protect the wellbeing of marginalized individuals.},

abstract = {Physical computing is a complex activity that consists of different but tightly coupled tasks: programming and assembling hardware for circuits. Prior work clearly shows that this coupling is the main source of mistakes that unfruitfully take a large portion of novices' debugging time. While past work presented systems that simplify prototyping or introduce novel debugging functionalities, these tools either limit what users can accomplish or are too complex for beginners. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose prototyping tool based on conversation. HeyTeddy guides users during hardware assembly by providing additional information on requests or by interactively presenting the assembly steps to build a circuit. Furthermore, the user can program and execute code in real-time on their Arduino platform without having to write any code, but instead by using commands triggered by voice or text via chat. Finally, the system also presents a set of test capabilities for enhancing debugging with custom and proactive unit tests. We codesigned the system with 10 users over 6 months and tested it with realistic physical computing tasks. With the result of two user studies, we show that conversational programming is feasible and that voice is a suitable alternative for programming simple logic and encouraging exploration. We also demonstrate that conversational programming with unit tests is effective in reducing development time and overall debugging problems while increasing users' confidence. Finally, we highlight limitations and future avenues of research.},

abstract = {We present a novel display metaphor which extends traditional tabletop projections in collaborative environments by introducing freeform, environment-aware display representations and a matching set of interaction schemes. For that purpose, we map personalized widgets or ordinary computer applications that have been designed for a conventional, rectangular layout into space-efficient bubbles whose warping is performed with a potential-based physics approach. With a set of interaction operators based on laser pointer tracking, these freeform displays can be transformed and elastically deformed using focus and context visualization techniques. We also provide operations for intuitive instantiation of bubbles, cloning, cut &amp; pasting, deletion and grouping in an interactive way, and we allow for user-drawn annotations and text entry using a projected keyboard. Additionally, an optional environment-aware adaptivity of the displays is achieved by imperceptible, realtime scanning of the projection geometry. Subsequently, collision-responses of the bubbles with non-optimal surface parts are computed in a rigid body simulation. The extraction of the projection surface properties runs concurrently with the main application of the system. Our approach is entirely based on off the-shelf, low-cost hardware including DLP-projectors and FireWire cameras.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses interactive technologies in the service of seniors. Adults over 65 form one of the largest and most rapidly growing user groups in the industrialized society. Interactive technologies have been steadily improving in their ability to provide practical support for these users and their daily challenges. These applications range from supporting low-literacy adults with mobile touch and spoken language interfaces [Munteanu et al. 2014], to interactive robotic fitness coaches for seniors [G\"{o}rer et al. 2016]. The goal of this chapter is to present an in-depth analysis of the needs of seniors, as well as to investigate how multimodal and multisensor technologies are used to address these needs.In Section 8.2 of this chapter, we structure the needs of older adults according to a hierarchy of human needs that emphasizes self-actualization [Maslow 1954]. Maslow's theoretical prism helps us to identify a broad spectrum of potential opportunities for researchers and practitioners who design multimodal-multisensor applications. We present a number of example applications in Section 8.3. These examples are illustrative of how interactive technologies, especially ones that leverage multiple modalities (e.g., speech, gestures, touch) and sensor data (e.g., location and accelerometers available on consumer phones) can provide a basis for meeting the needs of older adults. Section 8.4 briefly surveys future directions of multimodal-multisensor research that has potential for developing valuable new 320 Chapter 8 Multimodal Technologies for Seniors: Challenges and Opportunities assistive living technologies.1 Section 8.5 is a discussion of both design and implementation challenges, followed with conclusions in Section 8.6, and a list of supplementary Focus Questions to aid in further understanding of essential content. We hope that this broad overview will encourage both new and established researchers to explore how current or future multimodal and multisensor interfaces can better support one of the largest but most under-represented demographic groups.},

In this phase, communication with the clinicians is key for an increased survival probability.The multidisciplinary INTERACCT aims at developing a child friendly communication tool based on gamification principles in order to foster this important communication. Additionally, INTERACCT should stimulate exercises and treatment compliance. Finally, through analyzing gaming scores, INTERACCT should also act as a sensor for detecting problematic phases children are going through. Since the design of INTERACCT is key to its success, we present results from our user-centric and participative design approach using methods from design thinking and explorative design with school children aged 8-14. The results are game characters and story lines, which will inspire the game design of the INTERACCT computer games.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many people; the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 59 children are currently identified with ASD in the United States. Although it is difficult to generalize about people with ASD due to their heterogeneity, many share an affinity for technologies; as such, numerous academic endeavors and commercial products have focused on the creation of interactive technologies for ASD. In this article, we present findings from 19 interviews and 230 surveys with parents, teachers, and therapists who had children with ASD in their care and had considered or used interactive technologies with those children. We aimed to understand how interactive technologies were used, perceived, desired, and discovered. Findings of use and perception included the following: participants had tried a wide range of commercially available technologies but had very few reported products in common, products were limited to commercial mobile-based apps, and apps were typically perceived positively. In regard to desires, participants hoped for future technologies on diverse platforms (e.g., robots, virtual reality) with more consideration given to personalization, customization, and incorporation of audio and video. Findings about discovery included the following: participants chose technologies in an information-poor environment, and although there are many academic projects aimed at participants’ desires, no participants reported any experience working with researchers. Implications of this study include the need for a recommendation and information sharing system to help people choose and discover appropriate and effective interactive technologies that are a good fit for their child. This work also pointed to a need for such a system to include findings from lab (experimental and usability) studies of commercially available interactive technologies to provide measures of efficacy and usability. Our envisioned system could also potentially help academic researchers with outreach to wider audiences.},

On top of that, the increasing interest in incorporating user feedback into product development keeps pushing the limit of resources that UX research teams can allocate. Is this seemingly unstoppable appetite for user insights sustainable? How can UX researchers properly support their product teams' growing needs? We argue that, to be successful at scaling up Lean UX research, product teams need to become active actors in the process, while researchers need to use their expertise to provide guidance and training as required. As an example of this approach, we describe our experience organizing "Developer Day", a yearly event aimed at scaling up the Lean UX research practices of Microsoft's Developer Division. Developer Day has also extended the reach of the division's UX Research team for impacting decisions about the company's software developer tools and services.},

abstract = {The potential for integration of digital games and learning becomes ever more significant recently. One of the goals in educational game design is to create engaging and immersive learning experiences for delivering specified learning goals, outcomes and experiences. However, there is limited number of research done on game usability or quality of game user interface. Failure to design usable game interfaces can interfere with the larger goal of creating a compelling experience for users and can have a negative effect on the overall quality and success of a game. In this paper, we review usability problems identified by previous researchers and propose a history educational game design which includes pedagogical and game design component. Some snapshots of our game module are also presented. Finally we present a usability evaluation method for history educational game design. From our critical literature reviews, we also proposed six constructs which are interface, mechanics, gameplay, playability, feedback and immersion for usability evaluation.},

Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.},

New domains such as domestic and public environments, new influences from the arts and humanities, and new techniques in HCI itself are converging to suggest that multiple, potentially competing interpretations can fruitfully co-exist. In this paper, we lay out the contours of the new space opened by a focus on multiple interpretations, which may more fully address the complexity, dynamics and interplay of user, system, and designer interpretation.

abstract = {Social learning analytics are concerned with the process of knowledge construction as learners build knowledge together in their social and cultural environments. One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants.},

For later composition and reflection, ImageCascade provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. A study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers' preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process. We discuss the challenges in creating effective human-computer partnerships for creative activities, and suggest directions for future research.},

abstract = {User Interface (UI) design has been a core topic of HCI research for several decades. Equipped with design skills and knowledge, the expert interface designer meticulously analyses a design brief, conceptualises design ideas, and constructs viable solutions. The intended outcome of this tedious process is a usable and aesthetically-pleasing UI. Classical approaches in HCI have relied upon providing designers with guidelines, heuristics, and best practices for realising good designs. In recent years, computational approaches have turned towards formalising and automating parts of the design process. In this provocation, I claim that the future expert will hand over the task of creating design solutions entirely to the machine, and instead take on the role of an interface curator who inspects a set of feasible designs and picks out the best possible solutions for a given problem. I discuss the current state of computational interface design, and suggest a path forward towards realising this vision.},

There are big opportunities in the domain Aerospace &amp; Aviation at the same time. As the core software of the aero engine control unit, FADEC software is a kind of safety critical software which the processes of its development must do the compliance of RTCA DO-178C [1], and cost-effective of its development is a grand challenge.Information technology provides a new method for impoving the efficiency of safety critical software[2].Through information technology, some tasks of software development were automatically run by machines, such as source code building, static analysis and unit test of source code and so on.Because of the particularly of FADEC software, all run tasks needs to meet strict process specifications in order to ensure high guality of software[3]. Meanwhile, the construction of information has invested huge costs to ensure the stability and reliability of the environment which was depended by autorun tasks.As an information-based builder of software engineering, we need to be able to master the effectiveness of information technology to software development.This paper introduces a method to measure information technology effect based on data classification, collection and visualization. Through the data Visualization, the software support team and the R&amp;D team will be able to cooperate more efficiently and improve efficiency of FADEC software project.},

Yet, cultural diversity -- the diversity of community members' cultural backgrounds -- offers both significant benefits and challenges in the design, usage and evaluation of technologies. In this one-day workshop, we explore the role of cultural diversity in potentially informing, supporting, challenging or impacting the design of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) within community contexts. To delve into this complex and multifaceted space, we welcome workshop submissions that 1) engage broadly with the role of culture within technology design and usage for, with and by communities, as well as 2) proposals for approaches, tools, conceptual and methodological frameworks, case studies and best practices in community-based design that exploit cultural diversity as an asset and seek to encourage intercultural interactions. Our goal is to bring together academics and practitioners from different domains such as computer science, urban design, interactive art, anthropology and social sciences who share a common interest in exploring the design space of ICTs, culture and communities.},

Above all, we highlight the relationship between agent technology and HCI areas; and present a summary of how it has been applied and where it can be applied in African contexts as well as the benefits of its application. The usefulness of this study is depicted in its ability to illuminate the relationship between HCI and ABM/MAS and to explicitly show what can be possibly achieved using the agent modeling approach. It is our hope that the application of ABM/MAS would stimulate rich theoretical (and intellectual) discussions that further HCI development in Africa.},

abstract = {As the average overall life expectancy for individuals in the U.S. continues to increase along with the aging baby boomers, so too does the need for accessible healthcare solutions. It is reported that aging is one of the greatest known risk factors for the onset of cognitive impairment (CI), such as Alzheimer's disease. For individuals with more severe forms of CI, the inability to effectively perform mental tasks required for independent daily living can severely limit one's functionality. Traditional solutions for early detection of cognitive decline and impairment can be inaccessible, expensive, and time consuming. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop a dynamic online computerized neuropsychological testing system capable of rapidly tracking an individual's cognitive performance throughout the user's daily or weekly schedule in a way that is the least intrusive. By utilizing embedded microsensors within tablet devices, the proposed system will capture ambient and behavioral data pertinent to the real-world contexts and times of testing. Such sensor data has the potential to compliment psychometric results by providing insight into the contextual factors relevant to the user's testing efficacy and performance. In addition, the investigation into the accessibility issues faced by older adults will lead to improved neuropsychological testing interfaces.},

abstract = {The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.},

abstract = {We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.},

abstract = {Children's play objects are increasingly shaped by technological innovations that can transform them into hybrid, internet-connected toys, a phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Toys. Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R&amp;D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},

While the political nature of any technologies is widely acknowledged in human-computer interaction, such considerations have been less studied when designing for political engagement in social media services. We used speculative design probes to gauge how political elites perceive alternative social media interfaces designed to increase media diversity and decrease political polarisation. We show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. Based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. Our underlying contribution is wider. We show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. Second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. Finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. Therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media.},

We depict how care, vulnerability, harm, and emotions shape ethnographic and qualitative data. We argue that, especially in reflexive cultures, research subjects are active agents with agendas, accountabilities, and political projects of their own.

abstract = {We introduce a novel user interface and system for exploring extremely detailed 3D models in a museum setting. Three-dimensional models and associated information are presented on a large projection surface controlled by a touch-enabled surface placed at a suitable distance in front of it. Our indirect user interface, dubbed IsoCam, combines an object-aware interactive camera controller with an interactive point-of-interest selector and is implemented within a scalable implementation based on multiresolution structures shared between the rendering and user interaction subsystems. The collision-free camera controller automatically supports the smooth transition from orbiting to proximal navigation, by exploiting a distance-field representation of the 3D object. The point-of-interest selector exploits a specialized view similarity computation to propose a few nearby easily reachable interesting 3D views from a large database, move the camera to the user-selected point of interest, and provide extra information through overlaid annotations of the target view. The capabilities of our approach have been demonstrated in a public event attended by thousands of people, which were offered the possibility to explore submillimetric reconstructions of 38 stone statues of the Mont’e Prama Nuragic complex, depicting larger-than-life human figures, and small models of prehistoric Nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers). A follow-up of this work, using 2.5m-high projection screens, is now included in permanent exhibitions at two Archeological Museums. Results of a thorough user evaluation, involving quantitative and subjective measurements, are discussed.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe our efforts to retrace and reimagine period tracking technology—or, mobile applications designed to support the documentation and quantification of menstrual cycle data. In their current form, these systems often encourage those who menstruate to extract intimate information about the body (e.g., consistency or color of menstrual flow, physical and emotional symptoms), while promising to predict fertility and offer insight into managing one's period. In doing so, these technologies subtly dictate the forms of knowledge and types of relationships menstruators are expected to establish with their bodies (i.e., transactional or instrumentalized). Through historical analysis and a series of participatory experiments, we offer a vision for menstrual sensemaking that expands on these forms of interaction and ways of knowing to emphasize multiplicity and dimensionality rather than models, predictability, or a user's relation to averages or norms.},

abstract = {We report on the outcomes of a hackathon organised around the themes of absurd musical interfaces, questionable sonic interactions and unworkable music designs. At the core of the project is the intention to explore absurd making as a way to support critical and disruptive design practices. We reflect on how surreal, nonsensical and fragile artefacts can be helpful to stretch and critique conventional ideas of what is useful and appropriate in technology research and development. After introducing both concepts and methods that shaped the event we present a selection of useless interfaces designed by the hackathon's attendees. These musical artefacts, and the considerations around them, are then discussed as a viable means for communicating both design concerns and future visions. We also consider two features identified as playing a crucial role within the event: the discovery of contradictions and the importance of context-based ingredients.},

abstract = {There has been an increased interest in HCI research regarding the possibilities of interactive technology applied to the field of dance performance, particularly contemporary dance. This has produced numerous strategies to capture data from the moving bodies of the dancers and to map that data into different types of display formats. In this paper, we look at the role of interactive technology in dance performance from a broader perspective, aiming at understanding the needs of dancers and their relation with the audience. To this end, we ran a focus group with ten dancers with expertise in technology. We analysed the focus group using thematic analysis. We discuss the implications for design of our results by framing the role of technology in dance performance, proposing design guidelines related to the communication to the audience, use of technology, and mapping. Moreover, we propose different levels of ambiguity and appropriation related to the creators of the performance and the audience.},

To address the challenges of self-management of mental illnesses, we have developed the MONARCA system - a personal monitoring system for bipolar patients. We conducted a 14 week field trial in which 12 patients used the system, and we report findings focusing on their experiences. The results were positive; compared to using paper-based forms, the adherence to self-assessment improved; the system was considered very easy to use; and the perceived usefulness of the system was high. Based on this study, the paper discusses three HCI questions related to the design of personal health technologies; how to design for disease awareness and self-treatment, how to ensure adherence to personal health technologies, and the roles of different types of technology platforms.},

abstract = {Engaging students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is critical to ensure the success of the next generation of scientists and engineers. Given that 97% of American teens play video games, there is a tremendous opportunity to facilitate interest in STEM topics through the design of engaging learning games. While a growing number of serious games have been developed for biological science and computer science learning, few address the communication and technical challenges that arise in cyberinfrastructure intensive projects, where multiple domain scientists and computer scientists collaborate. This paper describes empirical data collected during a year-long human centered game design process, in which design ideas generated by high school students were bridged with cyberinfrastructure and bioinformatics learning concepts. Our research shows that "fun" and engaging game elements are well suited for addressing the sociotechnical aspects of cyberinfrastructure projects. In this research we provide a human centered game design methodology for science educators and science game designers, as well as design implications for integrating game-based experiences into the use of large-scale shared computing resources and services.},

abstract = {Critically oriented researchers within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have fruitfully intersected design and critical analysis to engage users and designers in reflection on underlying values, assumptions and dominant practices in technology. To successfully integrate this work within the HCI community, critically oriented researchers have tactically engaged with dominant practices within HCI in the design and evaluation of their work. This paper draws attention to the ways that tactical engagement with aspects of HCI evaluation methodology shapes and bears consequences for critically oriented research. We reflect on three of our own experiences evaluating critically oriented designs and trace challenges that we faced to the ways that sensibilities about generalizable knowledge are manifested in HCI evaluation methodology. Drawing from our own experiences, as well as other influential critically oriented design projects in HCI, we articulate some of the trade-offs involved in consciously adopting or not adopting certain normative aspects of HCI evaluation. We argue that some forms of this engagement can hamstring researchers from pursuing their intended research goals and have consequences beyond specific research projects to affect the normative discourse in the field as a whole.},

Body states are body movements and positions that players must discover in order to complete a level and in turn represent a learned game skill. The paper provides an overview of background concepts and related research. We describe the prototype and game structure, provide a technical description of the prototype and discuss technical issues related to sensing, reasoning and display. The paper contributes by providing a method for constructing group parameters from individual parameters with real-time motion capture data; and a model for mapping the trajectory of participant's actions in order to determine an intensity level used to manage the experience flow of the game and its representation in audio and visual display. We conclude with a discussion of known and outstanding technical issues, and future research.},

However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists' and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices.},

Our evaluation reveals that occupational therapists were able to make use of the toolkit without the aid of a technical expert. The therapists hacked everyday objects such as cushions, socks, cuddly toys and repurposed them for therapy. They computationally augmented them and tailored them to clients' needs and desires. From our evaluation, we also derive five guidelines that can inform others when creating DIY-toolkits for assistive technology.},

Using RFID-based paper mechanisms, IoT Stickers integrates common sensors and web services with interactive stickers through a trigger-action architecture.

Then, we elaborate the augmentations provided by the MR system in the three primary phases of a construction kit's lifecycle: Creation, Tweaking, and Usage. Finally, we demonstrate Ani-Bot with four application examples and evaluate the system with a two-session user study. The results of our evaluation indicate that Ani-Bot does successfully embed MRI into the lifecycle (Creation, Tweaking, Usage) of DIY robotics and that it does show strong potential for delivering an enhanced user experience.},

Since the conception of CTP in the late 1990s it has attracted interest from various areas, and through research is helping to yield new ways forward for problem areas, design and products in HCI. However the application of CTP has always been up to individuals and their own interpretation. The proposed framework tries to add structure through a series of easy to follow steps that the CTP adopter can use to apply CTP to their problem area, design or product. The framework is motivated by the need to provide the adopter with a straight forward way to critically think about his/her HCI arena. Ways to enable this are provided and areas for future work are discussed. The use cases presented help to demonstrate how the framework can be applied to each of these different areas.},

Quality Management as a main concern within the software industry is broader than the concept of testing. The V-Model sets a broader view with the concepts of Verification and Validation. Quality Assurance (QA) is another broader term that includes quality of processes. Configuration audits add more scope. In parallel there are some less visible dimensions in quality not often addressed in traditional models such as business alignment of QA efforts. This paper compares the commonly accepted models related to software quality management and proposes a model that fills an empty space in this area. The paper provides some analysis of the concepts of maturity and capability levels and provides some proposed adaptations for quality management assessment.},

However, despite these benefits there are also challenges and risks associated with engaging in public scholarship, particularly for early career researchers and those who are marginalized. This workshop will bring together those who already engage or are interested in this practice to discuss how to integrate public scholarship in our work, identify best practices for this type of work in the context of CSCW, including the ethical implications of outreach, and develop strategies to effectively support those most affected by the potential risks.},

abstract = {The aim of this workshop is to engage in co-design of personas to explore the interplay of autonomous technologies with user experience and engagement. Automating a process that is embedded into people's everyday lives and activities will surely impact their experience. In a time where there is strong push towards more and more automation in our daily life, the workshop will explore the value of co-design in bringing to the fore the opportunities and issues of such trend on users’ experiences and engagements in multiple contexts such as work, health, entertainment and learning. Through the co-design of personas in future scenarios of automation the workshop will concretely identify valuable automation design goals for user experience and engagement drawing on participants’ knowledge from industry projects and academic research.Tree concrete outcomes from the workshop are the following:},

abstract = {The advent of virtual and dispersed organizations increases the demand for collaborative systems and encourages research in the area of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Conflicts are inherent to collaborative work and can motivate reflection and interaction among stakeholders. However, current approaches to conflict management does not provide mechanisms to stimulate these processes. Moreover, only few use the context in supporting the resolution of the conflict. The aim of this work is to present a Context Sensitive Metacognitive Conflict Management (GCSC) approach for collaborative planning systems that promote reflection and interaction among stakeholders in order to improve collaboration. The approach evaluation was performed by using a prototype implementation of an ontology and an experimental study.},

abstract = {There is currently uncertainty in the research community as to how ICT can and should be designed in such a way that it can be convincingly integrated into the everyday lives of prison inmates. In this paper, we discuss a design fiction that closes this research gap. The descriptions and results of the study are purely fictitious. Excluded is the State of the Art as well as the description of the legal situation of prisons in Germany. The analysis of the fictional study data designed here thus refers to the real world in order to derive ethical guidelines and draw practical conclusions. It is our intention to use these results as a possible basis for further research. The paper presents results of an explorative study dealing with the design, development and evaluation of an AI-based Smart Mirror System, Prison AI 2.0, in a German prison. Prison AI 2.0 was developed for daily use and voluntarily tested by eight prisoners over a period of 12 months to gain insight into their individual and social impact, with an emphasis on its ability to actively support rehabilitation. Based on qualitative data, our findings suggest that intelligent AI-based devices can actually help promote such an outcome. Our results also confirm the valuable impact of (Psychosocial) ICT on the psychological, social and individual aspects of prison life, and in particular how prisoners used the Smart Mirror system to improve and maintain their cognitive, mental and physical state and to restore social interactions with the outside world. With the presentation of these results we want to initiate discussions about the use of ICT by prisoners in closed prisons in order to identify opportunities and risks.},

Thus far, research has primarily focused on robotics for the functional and emotional support of older adults. Robotic pets have been developed primarily for the older adult who is perceived as lonely and isolated, and fears have consequently arisen that robots will replace human caregivers and deceive older adults into developing relationships with them. Missing is the perspective of older adults on the ethics of and potential uses for robotic companion pets. In this study, we conducted focus groups with 41 older adults. We discuss concepts raised by focus group participants such as giving into the fiction of the robotic pet, the social role of the robot, and the role of reciprocity in building a relationship with a robotic pet. We present resulting considerations for new directions for robotic pet design for older adults.},

We argue that there is a unique role for the HCI community in linking the design and application of blockchain technology towards lived experience and the articulation of human values. In particular, we note how the accounting of transactions, a trust in immutable code and algorithms, and the leveraging of distributed crowds and publics around vast interoperable databases all relate to longstanding issues of importance for the field. We conclude by highlighting core conceptual and methodological challenges for HCI researchers beginning to work with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.},

abstract = {Australia has a rich array of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, but they face decline along with many valued aspects of culture unless they are passed down to, and used by, younger generations. Prior work on designing technologies for language learning has often taken particular language skills, learning theories, and technologies as their starting point. Our empirical work with a remote Aboriginal community illustrates four ways in which this community's language practices intersect with family relations and are deeply enmeshed with family histories and stories, Indigenous Knowledges, and activities on and about country. Thus, we argue for a relational approach that instead takes family communication and social activities as the basis for designing technologies that foster everyday language use. We outline the guiding principles of this design orientation, and illustrate how they have been taken up in the co-design of a talking soft toy called the 'Crocodile Language Friend.' Finally, we identify opportunities and open issues in taking a relational approach to designing technologies for language communities with similar needs and aspirations.},

Hyperion is able to retrieve text content from users' current view and deliver the content to them in different ways according to their context. We design four work modalities for different situations that mobile users encounter in their daily activities. In addition, user interaction interfaces are provided to adapt to different application scenarios. Although Google Glass may be constrained by its poor computational capabilities and its limited battery capacity, we utilize code-level offloading to companion mobile devices to improve the runtime performance and the sustainability of WAR applications. System experiments show that Hyperion improves users ability to be aware of text information around them. Our prototype indicates promising potential of converging WAR technology and wearable devices such as Google Glass to improve people's daily activities.},

We examine the current roles of information security visualisations and place these roles in the wider information visualisation discourse. We present an analytic lens which divides visualisations into three categories: journalistic, scientific and critical visualisations. We then present a case study that uses these three categories of visualisations to further support information security practice.Two significant results emerge from this case study: (1) visualisations that promote critical thinking and reflection (a form of critical visualisation) support the multi-stakeholder nature of risk assessment and (2) a preparatory stage in risk assessment is sometimes needed by service designers in order to establish the service design before conducting a formal risk assessment.The reader is invited to explore the images in the digital version of this paper where they can zoom in to particular aspects of the images and view the images in colour.},

To help organize and investigate this literature, this paper present a review of research on systems designed to support reflection. Key findings include that most work in this area does not actually define the concept of reflection. We also find that most evaluations do not focus on reflection per se rather but on some other outcome arguably linked to reflection. Our review also describes the relationship between reflection and persuasion evidenced implicitly by both rhetorical motivations for and implementation details of system design. After discussing the significance of our findings, we conclude with a series of recommendations for improving research on and design for reflection.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially. This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area. Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors. These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}

Previous studies have shown potential for cueing to improve upper limb rehabilitation, although these have been conducted in clinical settings. In this paper we describe CueS, a wrist worn cueing device which prompts the wearer to move their upper limb more frequently in their day to day lives. We conducted two, week-long 'in the wild' deployments of CueS with seven participants to obtain reflections and experiences around using the device. All participants reported increased general activity levels from wearing CueS and objective data showed increased levels of activity following cue provision. We reflect upon the potential of wearable cueing devices for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke.},

To address this challenge, we created a mixed-initiative interface called Mixer to aid administrators with automating tedious information-retrieval tasks. Users initiate communication with the agent by constructing a form, creating a structure to hold the information they require and to show context in order to interpret this information. They then populate the form with the desired results, demonstrating to the agent the steps required to retrieve the information. This method of form creation explicitly defines the shared understanding between human and agent. An evaluation of the interface shows that administrators can effectively create forms to communicate with the agent, that they are likely to accept this technology in their work environment, and that the agent's help can significantly reduce the time they spend on repeated information-retrieval tasks.},

This paper presents a first attempt at formalizing the digital gap created by the generalization of search engines. This was achieved through the development of a mapping of cognitive abilities required by users to execute low-level tasks during a standard Web search task. The mapping demonstrates how critical these abilities are to successfully use search engines with an adequate level of independence. It will lead to a set of design guidelines for search engine interfaces that will allow for the engagement of users of all abilities, and also, more importantly, in search algorithms such as query suggestion and measure of relevance (i.e. ranking).},

We present a systematic review of 204 papers and discuss wearable tracking systems according to their purpose, technological context, and target audience, as well as design and evaluation processes with particular attention to the meaningful involvement of older adults. Our results show that most systems focus on supervising older adults in the context of disease and frailty management. Only few systems focus on supporting older adults by promoting rehabilitation and respecting agency of older adults via self-monitoring PA, or encouraging PA to maintain healthy levels of activity. Moreover, systems are often narrowly limited to walking, although older adults may enjoy a broader range of activities. Likewise, the involvement of older adults in design processes is scarce, and their experience with a given technology is rarely considered relevant for evaluation. In sum, we contribute an overview of wearable technology for tracking older adults’ PA, contextualize our findings within recommendations provided by Sports and Rehabilitation Science, and illustrate opportunities for future work.},

EAST is an intermediary interactive tablet based app that assists in the early-detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by screening preschoolers in Pakistan through play-based activities in a home, school or clinical setting. Medical professionals, parents of autistic children and teachers were surveyed through focus groups to understand the reasons that contribute to the increasing number of missed early detections, and late- or misdiagnoses. We also evaluate the acceptability, usability and validity of our tool. We tested EAST with both typically developed and autistic children on how they relate to people, imitation, motor skills, visual and intellectual response. They were scored via time taken, the number of wrong attempts, or incorrect answers and audiovisual feedback. This paper contributes towards a digital autism screening tool that delivers insights into the child's behaviour and enables collaboration among parents, teachers and medical professionals.},

Software engineering students learned better and became more engaged with the topic of accessibility when it was tied to programming and development- based activities. The final form of the course was evaluated using a survey, and the results showed that students found the course beneficial to their education and relevant to their career.

abstract = {We present the results of a study designed to better understand information-seeking activities in bioinformatics software development by computer scientists and biologists. We collected data through semi-structured interviews with eight participants from four different bioinformatics labs in North America. The research focus within these labs ranged from computational biology to applied molecular biology and biochemistry. The findings indicate that colleagues play a significant role in information seeking activities, but there is need for better methods of capturing and retaining information from them during development. Also, in terms of online information sources, there is need for more centralization, improved access and organization of resources, and more consistency among formats. More broadly, the findings illustrate a variety of information problems that end-user biologists and professional software developers face in developing bioinformatics software and how they are influenced by the level of domain knowledge and technical expertise.},

We describe the historical and methodological background to Suchman's framework and the impact of her analysis on the development of HCI and related fields. We provide two examples of its use to support prototype evaluation, design reflection and generative and iterative design. Suchman's recognition that computers act on the basis of resources within their situations, just as people act in accord with the resources of theirs, broadens our focus from the design of interfaces to the design of situations within which interaction between people and computers can occur. The tool, and the methodological and theoretical commitments embedded within it, contribute to the design of emerging technologies and to current discussions about approaches to design within shifting paradigms of HCI.},

We investigate the military identity these veterans share. We explore how this may add to their reluctance in care-seeking behaviors. We also explore the roles of human and non-human intermediaries in ecologies of care and the potential for enhancing patient empowerment in current clinical treatment contexts. We discuss how military culture can be utilized in clinical care, how multiple perspectives can be leveraged to create a more holistic view of the patient, and finally, how veterans can be empowered during treatment. We conclude with recommendations for the design of sociotechnical systems that prioritize the above in support of the mental well-being of veterans with PTSD.},

Companions are intelligent, persistent, personalised, multimodal, natural language interfaces to the Internet and resources such as photo or music collections. They have the potential of turning our current human-machine interactions into human-machine relationships. In particular, a Companion prototype for reminiscing about a photo collection, called PhotoPal, is being used in our experiments. Several Wizard of Oz experiments have been run to assess people's reactions and thoughts about using a Companion interface. The feedback from these experiments has informed both the design direction and choice of development technologies going forward. The Wizard of Oz system has also been put to use in a classroom of young pupils and to aid adults make more productive use of the Internet for learning. Further experiments to investigate the appropriateness of Companion dialogue are planned.},

abstract = {More and more cities aim to solve their urban challenges by implementing various smart city initiatives. Involving citizens in the design of these projects has proven to be an essential precondition for a successful outcome. Therefore, citizen participation in the context of smart cities has gained a considerable attention by researchers and practitioners. However, participation can be instrumental to solely gain a smart label and must thus be carefully evaluated. Several evaluation frameworks, largely based on the seminal work of Arnstein's Ladder in 1969, have been developed over the years but can be oversimplified, too strict or not fit for a smart city context.Following design science research, this paper develops a holistic framework to evaluate participation in smart cities by bundling several established evaluation scales from the scientific literature. By means of this framework, it is possible to evaluate to what extent smart city initiatives are citizen-oriented. Then, the framework is applied to the cities of Dublin and London. In order to collect more detailed information, we applied it to the case of Knokke-Heist (Belgium). Based on the evaluation of this city, some recommendations for improvement of its smart city strategy are proposed.},

abstract = {The 20th century was based on local linear engineering of complicated systems. We made cars, airplanes and chemical plants for example. The 21st century has opened a new basis for holistic non-linear design of complex systems, such as the Internet and air traffic management. Interconnectivity, communication and interaction are major attributes of our evolving society. But, more interestingly, we have started to understand that chaos theory may be more important than reductionism, to better understand and thrive on Earth. Systems need to be investigated and tested as wholes, which requires a cross-disciplinary approach and new conceptual principles and tools. Consequently, schools cannot continue to only teach isolated disciplines based on simple reductionism. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) should also be integrated together with the Arts to promote creativity together with rationalization, and move (back) to STEAM (with an "A" for Arts). This concept shift emphasizes the possibility of longer-term socio-technical futures instead of short-term financial predictions that currently lead to uncontrolled economies. Human-centred design (HCD) can contribute to not only improving education technologies, systems and practices, but also as a discipline offering an integrated approach to learning by doing, expressing and critiquing, exploring possible futures, and understanding complex systems: HCD supports learning thinking.},

How do content creators make sense of these algorithms and what does that teach us about the roles that algorithms play in the social world? We take the case of YouTube because of its widespread use and the spaces for collective sense-making and mutual aid that content creators (YouTubers) have built within the last decade. We engaged with YouTubers in one-on-one interviews, performed content analysis on YouTube videos that discuss the algorithm, and conducted a wiki survey on YouTuber online groups. This triangulation of methodologies afforded us a rich understanding of content creators' understandings, priorities, and wishes as they relate to the algorithm. We found that YouTubers assign human characteristics to the algorithm to explain its behavior; what we have termed algorithmic personas. We identify three main algorithmic personas on YouTube: Agent, Gatekeeper, and Drug Dealer. We propose algorithmic personas as a conceptual framework that describes the new roles that algorithmic systems take on in the social world. As we face new challenges around the ethics and politics of algorithmic platforms such as YouTube, algorithmic personas describe roles that are familiar and can help develop our understanding of algorithmic power relations and accountability mechanisms.},

This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions. By detailing how and where researchers might observe interactions between values and technology design and use, we hope to enable researchers to systematically identify and investigate values in social computing.},

By minimizing the role of arguably error-prone human drivers, self-driving vehicles are heralded for improving traffic safety. Primarily driven by the technology’s potential impact, there is a rapidly evolving body of literature focused on consumer preferences. Missing, we argue, are studies that explore the needs and design preferences of older adults (60+). This is a significant knowledge gap, given the disproportionate impact that self-driving vehicles may have concerning personal mobility for older adults who are unable or unwilling to drive. Within this paper, we explore the design and interaction preferences of older adults through a series of enactment-based design sessions. This work contributes insights into the needs of older adults, which may prove critical if equal access to emerging self-driving technologies are to be realized.},

abstract = {Industry expectations of graduates are higher than ever. Not only are they required to be skilled in several technologies, but also need to be equipped with non-technical skills - often called soft skills or professional skills. This puts pressure on computing programs, as educators try to integrate these requirements into already full curricula. Although incorporating such skills into programs is seemingly common practice, little is known about what skills are being taught and why, outside of isolated case studies. In this work we ask: What non-technical skills are expected of undergraduate students according to computing programs? To answer this we manually curated 278 non-technical syllabi from 110 universities in 30 European countries. The most frequently identified skills are teamwork, ethics, written/oral communication, and presentation skills, while the development of one's own values, motivating others, creativity, and empathy feature least frequently. By providing a detailed analysis and an interactive website visualizing this data, we hope to aid the community in reviewing which non-technical skills are taught with an aim to teaching the right skills to the right students. This work sheds new light on what is expected of undergraduate computing students in terms of non-technical skills and identifies areas where more coverage might be needed.},

abstract = {Much of the research into integrating performance analysis in the design process has focused on the use of building information models (BIM) as input for analysis engines. The main disadvantage of this approach is that BIM models are resource intensive and thus are usually developed in the later stages of design. BIM models are also not necessarily compatible with energy analysis engines and thus a conversion and export process is needed. This can lead to data loss, calculation errors, and failures.Starting with the premise that energy analysis is more compatible with earlier design stages where simpler schematic models are the norm, this paper presents a software system that integrates non-manifold spatial topology, a parametric design environment and an energy analysis engine for a more seamless generate-test cycle in the early design stages. The paper includes a description of the system architecture, initial results, and an outline of future work.},

Recently battery systems have enabled households to store excess self-generated electricity for subsequent use. However the associated user-interfaces and displays can be hard to understand, potentially preventing households from optimizing their solar usage. This paper introduces a known method being deployed in a new context. It reports on on-going research that investigates the effect of in-home ambient light displays linked to the home battery system. The paper covers the design stage and potential feedback solutions to raise awareness and influence consumer behaviour to promote energy conservation. An Ambient Light System is proposed to enable better user feedback. The study outlines the design recommendation for an ambient light display to be used in an energy consumption context. Using such a display, households can optimize use of low Carbon solar energy within the home, thus minimizing grid electricity usage.},

Therefore, managing individual preferences is not enough to provide these people with suitable recommendations. In order to address this issue, we propose a Top-N recommendation model that combines the user's idiosyncratic aversions with her/his preferences in a personalized way to suggest the most compatible and likable Points of Interest for her/him. We are interested in finding a user-specific balance of compatibility and interest within a recommendation model that integrates heterogeneous evaluation criteria to appropriately take these aspects into account. We tested our model on both ASD and "neurotypical" people. The evaluation results show that, on both groups, our model outperforms in accuracy and ranking capability the recommender systems based on item compatibility, on user preferences, or which integrate these two aspects by means of a uniform evaluation model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we question the role of information technology (IT) designers in IT regulation. Through our concept of user centric regulation (UCR) we unpack what a closer alignment of IT design and regulation could mean. We also situate how they can respond to their ethical and legal duties to end users. Our concept asserts that human computer interaction (HCI) designers are now regulators and as designers are not traditionally involved in the practice of regulation hence the nature of their role is ill-defined. We believe designers need support in understanding what their new role entails, particularly managing ethical dimensions that go beyond law and compliance. We use conceptual analysis to consolidate perspectives from across Human Computer Interaction and Information Technology Law and Regulation, Computer Ethics, Philosophy of Technology, and beyond. We focus in this paper on the importance of mediation and responsibility and illustrate our argument by drawing on the emerging technological setting of smart cities.},

abstract = {People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) suffer from declining mobility capabilities, which cause a prevalent risk of falling. Commonly, short periods of motor blocks occur during walking, known as freezing of gait (FoG). To slow the progressive decline of motor abilities, people with PD usually undertake stationary motor-training exercises in the clinics or supervised by physiotherapists. We present a wearable system for the support of people with PD and FoG. The system is designed for independent use. It enables motor training and gait assistance at home and other unsupervised environments. The system consists of three components. First, FoG episodes are detected in real time using wearable inertial sensors and a smartphone as the processing unit. Second, a feedback mechanism triggers a rhythmic auditory signal to the user to alleviate freeze episodes in an assistive mode. Third, the smartphone-based application features support for training exercises. Moreover, the system allows unobtrusive and long-term monitoring of the user’s clinical condition by transmitting sensing data and statistics to a telemedicine service.We investigate the at-home acceptance of the wearable system in a study with nine PD subjects. Participants deployed and used the system on their own, without any clinical support, at their homes during three protocol sessions in 1 week. Users’ feedback suggests an overall positive attitude toward adopting and using the system in their daily life, indicating that the system supports them in improving their gait. Further, in a data-driven analysis with sensing data from five participants, we study whether there is an observable effect on the gait during use of the system. In three out of five subjects, we observed a decrease in FoG duration distributions over the protocol days during gait-training exercises. Moreover, sensing data-driven analysis shows a decrease in FoG duration and FoG number in four out of five participants when they use the system as a gait-assistive tool during normal daily life activities at home.},

Current approaches (e.g. agreeing to Terms and Conditions) are rooted in the idea of individual control despite growing evidence that users do not (or cannot) exercise such control in informed ways. We consider an alternative approach whereby users can opt to delegate consent decisions to an ecosystem of third-parties including friends, experts, groups and AI entities. We present the results of a study that used a technology probe at a large festival to explore initial public responses to this reframing -- focusing on when and to whom users would delegate such decisions. The results reveal substantial public interest in delegating consent and identify differing preferences depending on the privacy context, highlighting the need for alternative decision mechanisms beyond the current focus on individual choice.},

year = {2012},
publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {Agent based simulations often model humans and increasingly it is necessary to do this at an appropriate level of complexity. It has been suggested that the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) paradigm is suitable for modeling the cognitive processes of agents representing (some of) the humans in an agent based modeling simulation. This approach models agents as having goals, and reacting to events, with high level plans, or plan types, that are gradually refined as situations unfold. This is an intuitive approach for modeling human cognitive processes. However, it is important that users can understand, verify and even contribute to the model being used. We describe a tool that can be used to explore, understand and modify, the BDI model of an agent's cognitive processes within a simulation. The tool is interactive and allows users to explore options available (and not available) at a particular agent decision point.},

Crowdsensing systems are a unique chance to increase the users' awareness of this problem and to provide more fine-grained data to policymakers so that they can adopt appropriate strategies. In this paper, we present a crowdsensing system to collect air pollution in urban and suburban environments through the use of bicycles. It consists of a Web application, enriched with gamification elements, that communicates with a portable low-cost sensor. The user interface of such a system, as well as the adopted gamification mechanisms, has been designed by involving a group of target users, with the aim of better meeting users' preferences and needs, and, then, better engaging them.},

People increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. Moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. The Ambient Birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. We trialled the Ambient Birdhouse with five families. Key findings are that the playful nature of the Birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. Children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the Birdhouse. Learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning.},

One way of "getting the design right" is to quickly sketch a multitude of designs to be modified, adjusted and elaborated on. To date, on-body rapid prototyping methods do not afford these "quick-and-dirty" design processes. We propose using piezo-resistive kinesiology tape as a low-cost and versatile resource for sketching functional on-skin interfaces. Our method uses pretreated kinesiology tape, which is made piezo-resistive through polymerization, and serves as touch, pressure and stretch sensor. We illustrate ketching techniques with both pretreated and untreated tape for iterative design of on-skin interfaces. In addition, we contribute a set of sensor primitives that facilitate various input modalities for creating interactive sketches.},

However, studies have yet to focus on the ways in which these technologies are used by individuals who are blind, along with whether barriers are encountered during the process of interaction. To address this gap, we interviewed fourteen legally-blind adults with experience of home and/or mobile-based VAPAs. While participants appreciated the access VAPAs provided to inaccessible applications and services, they faced challenges relating to the input, responses from VAPAs, and control of information presented. User behavior varied depending on the situation or context of the interaction. Implications for design are suggested to support inclusivity when interacting with VAPAs. These include accounting for privacy and situational factors in design, examining ways to support concerns over trust, and synchronizing presentation of visual and non-visual cues.},

Nine main themes emerged from analysis of the participant interviews, including the challenges faced when using a mobile device one-handed while using a cane to detect obstacles along the intended path, the impact of using a mobile device under inhospitable conditions, and concerns associated with using a mobile device in environments where privacy and safety may be compromised (e.g. when using public transport). These were found to reduce the quality of the subjective interaction experience, and in some cases limiting use of mobile technologies in public venues. Insights from our research can be used to guide the design of future mobile interfaces to better meet the needs of users whose needs are often excluded from the design process.},

abstract = {The article describes an ideographic study conducted with 10 to 11 years old students to investigate their perceptions, ideas and imaginaries about robots. Its objective is to use this understanding to expand the ways of thinking the pedagogy of educational robotics. The study employed an art-based research approach and focused on involving students in the process of producing a fictional audiovisual narrative about robots. We analyzed their creative process and the resulting video through a multimodal approach. This analysis allowed identifying the different imaginaries, discourses and ideas that the participants have around the concept of "robot". These axes are used as cornerstones to begin a reflexive process to problematize and enable new perspectives to the pedagogy of educational robotics.},

abstract = {Statistical topic models can help analysts discover patterns in large text corpora by identifying recurring sets of words and enabling exploration by topical concepts. However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations - interpretation and trust - for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of "word-borrowing" that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.},

abstract = {Authentication based on touchless mid-air gestures would benefit a multitude of ubiquitous computing applications, especially those that are used in clean environments (e.g., medical environments or clean rooms). In order to explore the potential of mid-air gestures for novel authentication approaches, we performed a series of studies and design experiments. First, we collected data from more then 200 users during a 3-day science event organized within a shopping mall. These data were used to investigate capabilities of the Leap Motion sensor, observe interaction in the wild, and to formulate an initial design problem. The design problem, as well as the design of mid-air gestures for authentication purposes, were iterated in subsequent design activities. In a final study with 13 participants, we evaluated two mid-air gestures for authentication purposes in different situations, including different body positions. Our results highlight a need for different mid-air gestures for differing situations and carefully chosen constraints for mid-air gestures. We conclude by proposing an exemplary system, which aims to provide tool-support for designers and engineers, allowing them to explore authentication gestures in the original context of use and thus support them with the design of contextual mid-air authentication gestures.},

Findings from a survey of 659 undergraduate and graduate students highlight the relationship between harassment, well-being, and engagement in strategies to manage one's online identity. We further identify differences in harassment experiences across three popular social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We conclude by discussing this study's contribution to feminist theory and describing five potential design interventions derived from our data that may minimize these negative experiences, mitigate the psychological harm they cause, and provide women with more proactive ways to regain agency when using communication technologies.},

Many attempts have been made to design co-creation platforms that allow end users to personalize their own shoes. Those co-creation platforms primarily concentrate on color selection. This research takes a different approach and designs a toolkit for maker-oriented users to co-manufacture their own shoes. The toolkit was designed in different levels and deployed to makers via crowdsharing worldwide. Backers were surveyed before deployment and interviewed after two years to understand personalization over a larger amount of time with the research product. We find that users who have greater bespoke tools and materials in their toolkits are more likely to personalize their shoes while co-manufacturing. The research provides guidelines for researchers and designers creating toolkits, designing personalization product service systems/configurators and engaging in tangible bespoke processes.},

This paper presents two complementary studies investigating the experience of households living with a conversational agent over an extended period of time. First, we gathered the history logs of 75 Alexa participants and quantitatively analyzed over 278,000 commands. Second, we performed seven in-home, contextual interviews of Alexa owners focusing on how their household interacts with Alexa. Our findings give the first glimpse of how households integrate Alexa into their lives. We found interesting behaviors around purchasing and acclimating to Alexa, in the number and physical placement of devices, and in daily use patterns. Participants also uniformly described interactions between children and Alexa. We conclude with suggestions for future improvement for intelligent conversational agents.},

We conducted two contextual observations of twelve people with cognitive impairments cooking in sheltered living facilities and supplemented this data through interviews with four employees and volunteers who supervise them. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes to inform design requirements for communal cooking activities: Work organization, community, supervision, and practicalities. Based on these, we present five design implications for assistive systems in kitchens for people with cognitive deficiencies.},

We propose a participatory approach to sonic interaction design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build richer sonic interactions.},

Such a vision relies on integration of multiple subfields of computer science, and a commitment to an understanding of the domain of application. It supports the hopes of a grid/cyberinfrastructure-enabled future that makes use of social software. However, in contrast to how emergency management is often understood, it aims to push beyond the idea of monitoring on-line activity, and instead focuses on an understudied but critical aspect of mass emergency response---the needs and roles of members of the public. By viewing the citizenry as a powerful, self-organizing, and collectively intelligent force, information and communication technology can play a transformational role in crisis. Critical topics for research and development include an understanding of the quantity and quality of information (and its continuous change) produced through computer-mediated communication during emergencies; mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness and security of information; mechanisms for aligning informal and formal sources of information; and new applications of information extraction techniques.},

abstract = {As a pandemic rages and ecosystems around the globe collapse, the LIMITS community---along with the rest of the world---is working to adapt. Some adaptations to adjust to emergencies are easy to imagine. For example, months before in-person conferences were canceled in response to COVID-19, the User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) 2019 conference took significant steps towards hosting a geographically distributed, virtual conference, in part adapting to the global climate emergency. This type of change is conceptually clear, if organizationally challenging. However, many needed changes are conceptually difficult, even in the midst of an existential crisis. It is long-recognized that we need to bridge the separation between scholarly venues and publications that focus on technical aspects of computing systems (i.e., "applied") and those that center social and political aspects of computing systems research and design, particularly when attempting to address complex life-wide problems. Yet, disciplinary crystals (e.g., siloes) remain resistant to change. The authors of this paper contribute to ongoing socio-technical efforts, identifying dominant practices and forces that reinforce the socio-technical divide, and holding up empirical projects that offer promising alternatives.We resist the dominant norm to claim that our contributions to scholarship are original, cutting-edge, or unique. Rather this paper revisits a research paradigm from the past because it remains useful and generative for the computing research communities of the future. Through our inquiry we identify a long-standing tendency to include a pivot---a distinct turn to privilege the design of new digital artifacts---even in papers advocating for more expansive conceptualizations of interactive systems. While acknowledging the importance of the initial design of material artifacts (and their associated infrastructures), we reject the assumption that the ultimate "good" of computing or interactive design research is creating new digital artifacts/tools for the marketplace. We offer four provocations to help us understand why material-based, industry-oriented narratives dominate applied venues of computing. Empirical examples from projects around the world, including work that extends the relational and temporal boundaries of computing design, offer alternative approaches.Fundamentally, we ask readers to consider the type of research that the LIMITS community values and in what ways is this scholarship of value to a world in crisis. How does LIMITs research matter?},

Since the time of our early ancestors, our brains have gotten no bigger; nevertheless, there has been a steady accretion of new tools for intellectual work (including advanced visual interfaces) and an increasing distribution of complex activities among many minds. Despite this transcendence of human cognition beyond what is "inside" a person's head, most studies and frameworks on cognition have disregarded the social, physical, and artifactual surroundings in which cognition and human activity take place.Distributed intelligence provides an effective theoretical framework for understanding what humans can achieve and how artifacts and tools can be designed and evaluated to empower human beings and to change tasks.This paper presents and discusses the conceptual frameworks and systems that we have developed over the last decade to create effective socio-technical environments supporting distributed intelligence.},

Progress in falls rehabilitation, which consists of improved performance in balance and muscle strength, is essential to assuring seniors of a reduced risk of falling. In this paper, we build on our previous research into exergames for falls, and we investigate how an exergame system can be used to communicate long-term progress to seniors. Using a multiphase user-centered requirements gathering process, we first investigated stakeholder perspectives regarding progress in self-managed rehabilitation. Following this we describe the home-based evaluation of our prototype exergame system, which highlights rehabilitation progress, with seniors, over a period of 2 months. Progress, in our system is communicated using charts of exercise performance and frequency, as well as medals awarded for achieving longer-term rehabilitation milestones. We report on seniors' opinions and preferences regarding the potential of our exergame system to communicate this rehabilitation progress in a meaningful way. Finally we discuss implications for design, based on our studies, to inform the development of more effective exergame systems for long-term unassisted rehabilitation in the home.},

In this paper, we explore how everyday postcolonial memories of Namibian youth engaged the wider public into a dialogue revisiting narrative of the past in order to explore alternative futures. Voices of the youth were amplified through an experimental participatory public exhibition leveraging interactive technologies. The exhibition resulted from collaborative memory making with marginalised voices, highlighting the role of youth as agents for change in postcolonial Namibia. Experiences from the exhibition showed how meaningful dialogues and interactions between museum audiences, interactive installations and the youth, created new perspectives on postcolonialism, and how exploring everyday memories and materials from the past may contribute to creating inclusive futures. We conclude that new forms of dialogic engagements are created through 'blurred boundaries' between people, their collective memories and technologies.},

We also discuss the city's efforts to support local behavioral health needs through the development of a community health record. Placing fieldwork findings in conversation with the goals of this ongoing civic design project, we propose the analytic sensibility of precarious intervention to unpack the significance of the infrastructural tensions and power relations at play when people seek solutions to complex sociotechnical problems. Precarious intervention calls for CSCW research that attends to 1) the collective labor necessary to create and maintain ecologies of care in the face of infrastructural brokenness; and 2) the high-stakes and varied costs of 'engagement' for different community stakeholders.},

abstract = {Elicitation studies, where users supply proposals meant to effect system commands, have become a popular method for system designers. But the method to date has assumed a within-subjects procedure and statistics. Despite the benefits of examining the relative agreement of independent groups (e.g., men versus women, children versus adults, novices versus experts, etc.), the lack of appropriate tools for between-subjects agreement rate analysis have prevented so far such comparative investigations. In this work, we expand the elicitation method to between-subjects designs. We introduce a new measure for evaluating coagreement between groups and a new statistical test for agreement rate analysis that reports the exact p-value to evaluate the significance of the difference between agreement rates calculated for independent groups. We show the usefulness of our tools by re-examining previously published gesture elicitation data, for which we discuss significant differences in agreement for technical and non-technical participants, men and women, and different acquisition technologies. Our new tools will enable practitioners to properly analyze their user-elicited data resulted from complex experimental designs with multiple independent groups and, consequently, will help them understand agreement data and verify hypotheses about agreement at more sophisticated levels of analysis.},

abstract = {The number of speech interfaces and services made available through them continue to grow. This has opened up interactions to people who rely on speech as a critical modality for interacting with systems. However, people with diverse speech patterns such as those who stammer are at risk of being negatively affected or excluded from speech interface interaction. In this paper, we consider what an inclusive speech interface future may look like for people who stammer. In doing so, we identify three key challenges: (1) developing effective speech recognition, (2) understanding the user experiences of people who stammer and (3) supporting speech interfaces designers through appropriate heuristics. We believe the interdisciplinary and cross-community strengths of venues like CUI are well positioned to address these challenges going forward.},

abstract = {To protect under-represented and marginalized workers from the upcoming automation boom, it is imperative to critically examine the past technological breakthroughs and their impacts on workers. In the last two decades of the twentieth century, computer-aided newspaper production technology gradually started becoming popular in Bangladesh, making the traditional hot metal typesetting technology obsolete. The typesetters, who relied on manual labor and a very basic level of literacy, experienced mass layoffs and had to adapt to new technology to survive in their profession. In this work, we interviewed 17 typesetters from that period to understand their technology adoption dynamics. Our findings reveal that despite a few success stories, most of the typesetters failed to adopt and gradually went into oblivion, mainly because of local infrastructural issues. We connect our findings to broader issues of culture, politics, and economics and provide concrete suggestions and policy recommendations to protect more than six million workers who are vulnerable to technology-induced job displacement in the next 20 years in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Learning to create well-designed and robust Java programs requires, besides a good understanding of the language, a significant amount of practice. In this paper we present the JavaFest, a collaborative learning technique for teaching Java to beginning programmers. A JavaFest is a group exercise that instructors can add to their repertoire of teaching techniques. It provides an opportunity for students to practice programming in a motivating but non-threatening environment, and to learn from the experience of their peers. Moreover, a JavaFest allows the instructor to gain insight into the current standing of the students in her class.We describe the concept of a JavaFest and present three case studies in the form of three concrete JavaFests we developed and evaluated in our own object-oriented programming course. The general idea of a JavaFest, and the three specific examples we describe and evaluate, can easily be adopted to enhance any Java programming course.},

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) founded in SB approaches are visually designed, simple to use, and are also complex in functionality. Because of the heterogeneity of individuals with autism, personalization and customization are key features for applications to be accessible to a wide variety of user-experiences and needs. By using natural autistic communication-orientation and design preferences, it is possible that learned skills will become more generalizable and that other outcome types will be encouraged. As a key feature of SB approaches, ICT development must incorporate and collaborate with the autistic community these technologies seek to support.},

Currently, assistive technologies that provide in-home cognitive support for those with degenerative brain diseases have not been widely adopted, and individuals often rely entirely on informal caregivers to aid them in planning and performing the daily activities that allow them to continue living independently. To help these individuals, we designed Robin, a conceptual context-aware assistive application that supports independent living for users with cognitive impairments by providing temporally and physically appropriate audio prompting for the routine tasks that are most important for health outcomes and life satisfaction.},

Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for such research within CHI and related fields such as gerontechnology. For this, we plan to create a space for discussing and sharing principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces (UI) for the ageing population. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of UIs for older adults. Building on the success of last two year's workshops, we aim to grow the community of CHI researchers across borders interested in this topic by fostering a space to exchange results, methods, approaches, and ideas from research on interactive applications in support of older adults that are reflective of international diversity that is representative of CHI.},

In the rTag view, conceivably incorrect sentences in an article are linked with different information; the sentences where other articles are linked are displayed struck through. A study of comparing the regular and rTag views was conducted. The results confirmed that the readers who read in the rTag view recognised facts significantly better than the control group. Though the rTag view alone does not verify the factuality of news, but they suggest readers which parts of the news need to be fact-checked while encourage them to be proactive in critical reading of the news.},

Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.},

abstract = {The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum, a realization of such a platform, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with realtime assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden- and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.},

Inspired by these findings, we explore the feasibility of friendsourced moderation as a technique for combating online harassment. We present Squadbox, a tool to help recipients of email harassment coordinate a "squad" of friend moderators to shield and support them during attacks. Friend moderators intercept email from strangers and can reject, organize, and redirect emails, as well as collaborate on filters. Squadbox is designed to let its users implement highly customized workflows, as we found in interviews that harassment and preferences for mitigating it vary widely. We evaluated Squadbox on five pairs of friends in a field study, finding that participants could comfortably navigate around privacy and personalization concerns.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a novel approach to procedural content generation, intent on supporting game design activities. The distinctive factor in this approach is that content generation is guided by a series of target experience indicators, which the designer can define freely according to his own agenda. We detail its underlying concepts and procedural logic, as well as its purported benefits, and outline early experiments in the design process of a prototype.},

abstract = {It is common to use computers to design shapes of physical objects such as furniture, but geometric modeling and the physical validity of shapes are conventionally considered independently. This makes creating aesthetically pleasing yet physically valid models challenging. In this paper, we propose an interactive design framework for the efficient and intuitive exploration of geometrically and physically valid shapes. During any geometric editing operation, the system continuously allows visualization of the valid range of the parameters being edited. When one or more constraints are violated following an operation, the system generates multiple suggestions involving both discrete and continuous changes to restore validity. Each suggestion is accompanied by an editing mode, which simultaneously adjusts multiple parameters in a coordinated manner to maintain validity. Thus, while the user focuses on the aesthetics of the design, our computational design framework helps to achieve physical realizability by providing active guidance to the user. We demonstrate our framework on plank-based furniture designs with nail-joints and frictional constraints. We use our system to design a range of examples, conduct a user study, and also fabricate a physical prototype to test its validity and usefulness.},

abstract = {Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although evidence-based psychotherapy is effective, engagement from such programs can be low. Mobile apps have the potential to help engage and support people in their therapy. We developed Pocket Skills, a mobile web app based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Pocket Skills teaches DBT via a conversational agent modeled on Marsha Linehan, who developed DBT. We examined the feasibility of Pocket Skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use. We present a model based on qualitative findings of how Pocket Skills supported DBT. Pocket Skills helped participants engage in their DBT and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their DBT skills and increase their self-efficacy. We discuss the design implications of these findings for future mobile mental health systems.},

It will be led by members of the ACM SIGCHI Research Ethics Committee. We will pose open questions and invite audience discussion of practices centered on recent "hot topic" issues. For this year's town hall, the primary focus will be on paths to balancing the often-competing regulatory frameworks under which we operate (some of which having recently undergone significant revisions) with our community's efforts to reveal ethical challenges posed by new interactive technologies and new contexts of use. We will engage the audience in discussions on whether there is a non-colonial role for ethics education within the broad HCI community, how that may capture the cultural and disciplinary differences that are woven into CHI's fabric, and how research ethical issues should be handled in SIGCHI paper submission and review process.},

abstract = {End-users are often perceived as the weakest link in information security. Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.},

One of the main barriers to assisting individuals with pointing problems is a lack of frequent and low-cost assessment of pointing ability. We are working to build technology to automatically assess pointing problems during every day (or real-world) computer use. To this end, we have gathered and studied real-world pointing use from individuals with motor impairments and older adults. We have used this data to develop novel techniques to analyze pointing performance. In this article, we present learned statistical models that distinguish between pointing actions from diverse populations using real-world pointing samples. We describe how our models could be used to support individuals with different abilities sharing a computer, or one individual who experiences temporary pointing problems. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of real-world pointing. We hope that these techniques will be used to develop systems that can automatically adapt to users’ current needs in real-world computing environments.},

abstract = {Over the past years, Virtual Archaeology has introduced more experiential elements in virtual reconstructions, therefore going beyond the traditional visualization of 3D architectural models. In the case of dissemination, these experiences equate to a trip in time, in which users witness what the past was like and learn about it. However, due to a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks and/or systematic evaluation focusing on such experiential elements, it is uncertain whether the intended goals are achieved and why. Based on a novel theoretical framework arising from the concept of Cultural Presence, this article will investigate if and how current virtual environments achieve the feeling of traveling to the past. To that end, six different virtual reconstructions of the Neolithic site of \c{C}atalh\"{o}y\"{u}k (Turkey) were built and evaluated in a between-subjects experiment. The results support the role of content meaningfulness, responsive characters, enhanced interaction, and multisensory realism in the achievement of successful Virtual Reality--mediated experiences.},

Previous reviews looked at deformation as a material property of shape-changing interfaces and concentrated on output. As such,deformable input was under-discussed. We distinguish deformable from shape-changing interfaces to concentrate on input. We survey 131 papers on deformable interfaces and review their key design elements (e.g., shape, material) based on how they support input. Our survey shows that deformable input was often used to augment or replace rigid input, particularly on elastic and flexible displays. However, when shapes and materials guide interactions, deformable input was used to explore new HCI paradigms, where gestures are potentially endless, and input become analogy to sculpting, metaphor to non-verbal communication, and expressive controls are enhanced. Our review provides designers and practitioners with a baseline for designing deformable interfaces and input methodically. We conclude by highlighting under-explored areas and identify research goals to tackle in future work with deformable interfaces.},

abstract = {The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.},

A successful design of the hybrid cloud architecture should facilitate the provisioning of scalable and secure services suited to a variety of communities such as residential homes and high-tech business incubators. In this paper, we present a novel "In-the-know" recommendation framework for provisioning of cloud resources in the form of 'on-demand contracts' to address the challenges in delivering the hybrid service variations for different community and individual needs. Our recommendation framework uses knowledge of the city's socio-economic goals/values as well as user preferences in terms of cost, performance and mobility. Using such knowledge, it recommends dynamic decisions by choosing from various provisioning alternatives in order to: (a) ensure optimal user Quality of Experience (QoE) in service delivery, and (b) effective utilization of hybrid cloud resources. We validate our recommendation framework using service composition experiments to satisfy an exemplar collaboration use case in an actual city-supported hybrid cloud test bed involving citizen consumers.},

Our work draws on research in HCI and the social sciences and findings from ethnographic studies in four sites -- two amateur "fixers" collectives' in Brooklyn and Seattle, USA and two mobile phone repair communities in Uganda and Bangladesh -- to advance two arguments. First, studies of repair account for new sites and processes of value that differ from those appearing at HCI's better-studied moments of design and use. Second, repair may embed modes of human interaction with technology and with each other in ways that surface values as contingent and ongoing accomplishments, suggesting ongoing processes of valuation that can never be fully fixed or commoditized. These insights help HCI account for human relationships to technology built into the world through repair.},

We analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. The results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. It is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development.},

abstract = {Recent decade has seen a dramatic change in the information systems landscape that alters the ways we design and interact with information technologies, including such developments as the rise of business analytics, user-generated content, and NoSQL databases, to name just a few. These changes challenge conceptual modeling research to offer innovative solutions tailored to these environments. Conceptual models typically represent classes (categories, kinds) of objects rather than concrete specific objects, making the class construct a critical medium for capturing domain semantics. While representation of classes may differ between grammars, a common design assumption is what we term different semantics same syntax (D3S). Under D3S, all classes are depicted using the same syntactic symbols. Following recent findings in psychology, we introduce a novel assumption semantics-contingent syntax (SCS) whereby syntactic representations of classes in conceptual models may differ based on their semantic meaning. We propose a core SCS design principle and five guidelines pertinent for conceptual modeling. We believe SCS carries profound implications for theory and practice of conceptual modeling as it seeks to better support modern information environments.},

Based on our qualitative data we also conduct a second qualitative study using a technology probe with15 low-income, low-literate women to explore the specific design of peer-support technologies for supportseeking and the sharing of sensitive and taboo narratives in a deeply patriarchal society. The design concernsraised by our participants regarding privacy, anonymity and safety provide CSCW researchers with valuableguidelines about designing for social connections and support for vulnerable populations within a particularcontext.},

Researchers have begun to problematize the asymmetric relationship between technical experts and users. In this paper, we focus on how roboticists-borrowing a term from Steve Woolgar-"configure" their robot users. Instead of focusing on what roboticists think of their robots or what users think of robots, we ask, "What do roboticists think of users'" Utilizing two exercises we call futuristic stories and value index cards, we conducted semi-structured interviews with roboticists to examine their discourse on robotics, robots, and users. We found that roboticists framed users as inevitably transforming from a na\"{\i}ve user to a sensible user equipped to handle their ideal, utilitarian robot. Our findings illustrate that roboticists and designers need to make transparent what forms of future users they desire and expect in their design processes.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

Teach Access is a consortium of 10 industry partners, 5 advocacy groups, and 20 university partners working to address this issue. In an attempt to bridge the gap between what is taught to students and the increasing demand from industry, the initiative described here was aimed at awarding instructor grants to support the development of accessibility modules in tech-related courses. In our study we surveyed student attitudes toward accessibility pre- and post-instruction of these modules, as well as, instructor strategy. We found that across all courses, student confidence in accessibility-related concepts increased. The largest increases were found in student confidence in defining the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Our work makes the following contributions: 1) A detailed description of how accessibility was integrated into 18 different university and college courses 2) Instructional delivery methods found to be effective by participating instructors 3) Insights for resource materials development.},

abstract = {Cities act as hubs designed to accommodate and support millions of inhabitants, nomads and tourists that rely on the city's infrastructure to move around, communicate and flourish as individuals and as a community. This shapes the culture, habits and pulse of a city creating an organic urban landscape often invisible to the naked eye, but traceable digitally. With the proliferation of sensing and pervasive technologies, we should be able to tell the levels of crowdedness of the city, its mood, or how clean it is by sensing and visualising these aspects. However, this poses interesting research and design questions; how would one design a device for tracking and visualising crowdedness on buses, for example. This workshop aims to explore the use of sensing technologies for visually resurfacing some of the hidden dynamics of the city by providing a collaborative and facilitated environment for applied research and creative exploration. This complements other workshops in the "urban" or "cities" theme, such as PURBA (Pervasive Urban Applications), that investigate urban environments from a theoretical perspective. After initial discussions on a joint workshop, the SenCity and PURBA organisers concluded that these workshops were complementary yet different enough to give participants the benefit of taking part in both; gaining the theory from PURBA and collaboratively applying practical research and creative flair at the SenCity workshop to sense, visualise and share the hidden pulse of Z\"{u}rich.},

abstract = {Motivation -- Modern collaborative environments often provide an overwhelming amount of visual information on multiple displays. The multitude of personal and shared interaction devices leads to lack of awareness of team members on ongoing activities, and awareness of who is in control of shared artefacts. This research addresses the situational awareness (SA) support of multidisciplinary teams in co-located collaborative environments. This work aims at getting insights into design and evaluation of large displays systems that afford SA and effective teamwork.Research approach -- An exploratory (Wassink et al., 2008) as well as experimental approach is applied. The results of our exploratory studies, which included contextual observations, interviews and task analysis, have been translated into requirements for support of multidisciplinary teamwork in life sciences (Kulyk and Wassink, 2006). Currently we perform practical case studies in omics experimentation domain (Kulyk et al., 2007). In a first controlled study we assess shared SA of team members, providing new SA concepts on a shared large display.Findings/Design -- We developed several concepts for SA support on large shared displays. Memory Board is an interface that automatically stores and visualizes the activity history on a shared large display. This allows team members to retrieve annotations made on previous slides or visualizations. It also provides awareness of who is currently in control of any display, and who is manipulating and annotating the visualizations. Highlighting on Demand interface enables a team member to highlight or fade out any part of a display using any personal interaction device.Take away message -- Designing systems that support situational awareness is of great importance to ensure that a collaborative environment enables efficient and effective team coordination and decision making.},

Drawing on a mix of archival materials, participant observation, and interviews within and beyond the city of Seattle, Washington, we look at the motivations of public restroom facilities managers as they introduce (or consider introducing) networked technology in the spaces they administer. Over the course of the research, we found internet of things technologies-or, connected devices imbued with computational capacity-became increasingly tied up with cost-reducing efficiencies and exploitative regulatory techniques. Drawing from this case study, we develop the concept of managerial visions: ways of seeing that structure labor, enforce compliance, and define access to resources. We argue that these ways of seeing prove increasingly critical to HCI research as it attends to computer-mediated collaboration beyond white-collar settings.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have been deployed with considerable success in many industries. However, the implementation of cyber-physical systems in hospitals has been limited. By nature, in clinical operations, patient safety and consideration for health outcomes are of the utmost importance, thus possibly slowing the implementation of innovative solutions with limited history. Revenues from operating room (OR) time and surgery account for about 50% of the income of major hospitals (Erdogan et al. 2011; Cuschieri 2006), but the efficiency of OR utilization is often reported to be relatively low. Therefore, improving OR management with a cyber-physical system should be a priority. In this article, we will report on our experience implementing a cyber-physical system at Houston Methodist Hospital and discuss some of the difficulties and potential drivers for success. Our pilot study was done in the context of the management of a large suite of ORs. It uses the agile codevelopment of a cyber-physical system through an intense collaboration of clinicians and computational scientists. While technology remains the foundation of a cyber-physical system, this experience reinforced that the human factor is an important driving force behind the design that promotes user acceptance.},

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge no existing SWfMSs directly support collaboration. Data is increasing in complexity, dimensionality, and volume, and the efficient analysis of data often goes beyond the realm of an individual and requires collaboration with multiple researchers from varying domains. In this paper, we propose a groupware system architecture for data analysis that in addition to supporting collaboration, also incorporates features from SWfMSs to support modern data analysis processes. As a proof of concept for the proposed architecture we developed SciWorCS - a groupware system for scientific data analysis. We present two real-world use-cases: collaborative software repository analysis and bioinformatics data analysis. The results of the experiments evaluating the proposed system are promising. Our bioinformatics user study demonstrates that SciWorCS can leverage real-world data analysis tasks by supporting real-time collaboration among users.},

abstract = {Increasingly the fields of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and art are intersecting. Interactive artworks are being evaluated by HCI methods and artworks are being created that employ and repurpose technology for interactive environments. In this paper we steer a path between empirical and critical-theoretical traditions, and discuss HCI research and art works that also span this divide. We address concerns about 'new' ethnography raised by Crabtree et al. (2009) in "Ethnography Considered Harmful", a critical essay that positions ethnographic and critical-theoretical views at odds with each other. We propose a mediated view for understanding interactions within open-ended interactive artworks that values both perspectives as we navigate boundaries between art practice and HCI.},

Addressing this untapped potential, we explore the concept of turning a flexible office chair into a ubiquitous input device. To facilitate daily desktop work, we propose the utilization of semaphoric chair gestures that can be assigned to specific application functionalities. The exploration of two usage scenarios in the context of focused and peripheral interaction demonstrates high potential of chair gestures as additional input modality for opportunistic, hands-free interaction.},

abstract = {Opioid use disorder (OUD) poses substantial risks to personal well-being and public health. In online communities, users support those seeking recovery, in part by promoting clinically grounded treatments. However, some communities also promote clinically unverified OUD treatments, such as unregulated and untested drugs. Little research exists on which alternative treatments people use, whether these treatments are effective for recovery, or if they cause negative side effects. We provide the first large-scale social media study of clinically unverified, alternative treatments in OUD recovery on Reddit, partnering with an addiction research scientist. We adopt transfer learning across 63 subreddits to precisely identify posts related to opioid recovery. Then, we quantitatively discover potential alternative treatments and contextualize their effectiveness. Our work benefits health research and practice by identifying undiscovered recovery strategies. We also discuss the impacts to online communities dealing with stigmatized behavior and research ethics.},

In this paper we aim to capture the software engineering practices of environmental scientists, highlight opportunities for software engineering and work towards developing a domain specific language for the configuration and deployment of environmental models. We hold a series of interviews with environmental scientists involved in developing and deploying computer based environmental models about the approach taken in engineering models, and describe a case study in deploying an environmental model (WRF: Weather Research Forecasting) on a cloud architecture. From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment. Together, we propose they will allow scientists to concentrate on fundamental science rather than specifics of the underlying computing.},

abstract = {Conventional smart city design processes tend to focus on instrumental planning for city systems or novel services for humans. Interacting with data produced by the new services and restructured systems entailed by these processes is commonly done via interfaces like civic dashboards, leading to a critique that data-driven urbanism is bound by the rules and constraints of dashboard design [1]. Informed citizens are expected to engage with new urban information flows through the logic of dashboard interfaces. What datastreams are left off the dashboard of engaged urban experience? What design opportunities arise when dashboard visualizations are moved into the domain of mixed reality? In this two-day workshop, participants will construct prototype mixed reality interfaces for engaging the informational layer of the built urban environment. Using the Unity game engine and the Microsoft HoloLens, participants will focus on generative design in the space of data-driven interfaces, addressing issues of data access, civic agency, and privacy in the context of smart cities. Specific attention will be paid to interfaces that facilitate harmonious co-existence between humans and non-human systems (AI, IoT, etc.).},

Such digitization enables the use of automated digital image analysis techniques, which could be beneficial for the diagnostic review and prognosis of a variety of conditions. As yet, human-computer interaction (HCI) issues in this field, which is mostly based on visual analysis, have not been systematically explored. Based on reflecting on the process of designing and deploying systems for digital pathology, we propose a new understanding to design automated tools for such environments. We used meeting minutes, design briefs, interviews, personal notes and other artifacts to conduct a thematic analysis. This enabled us to establish four design considerations for introducing digital image analysis to routine pathology that concern level of detail, verification, communication and transparency.},

Thus, tests and a validation process are crucial for implementing effective systems. However, testing and validating software systems for the AAL in real environments are onerous and safety-critical tasks. Problems often arise when the software is being installed in a real smart home: unpredicted scenarios can occur, thus forcing the designer to perform complex fixing when it is too late. This paper proposes the adoption of a 3D simulator to speed up the development and testing phases of software for AAL systems, by restricting possible issues occurring during the tests in real scenarios. The paper describes the architecture of the simulator and the implemented virtual environment. Moreover, it presents a use case, highlighting how the simulator allows decoupling the software to manage a smart home from the hardware components.},

In this article, we reflect on a comprehensive suite of tools that we've been building to empower everyone to perform data science more efficiently and effortlessly, including DataSpread, a scalable spreadsheet tool that combines the benefits of spreadsheets and databases, and ZenVisage, a visual exploration tool that accelerates the discovery of trends or patterns. Our tools have been developed in collaboration with experts in various disciplines, including neuroscience, battery science, genomics, astrophysics, and ad analytics. We will discuss some of the key technical challenges underlying the development of these tools, and how we addressed them, drawing from ideas in multiple disciplines. in the process, we will outline a research agenda for tool development to empower everyone to tap into the hidden potential in their datasets at scale.},

However, current research focuses primarily on the design and fabrication of general-purpose processors based on RISC-V, despite the fact that in the era of IoT (Internet of Things), the fusion of heterogeneous platforms should also take application-specific processors into account. Accordingly, this paper proposes a collaborative RISC-V multi-core system for Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a multi-core scheduling architecture for DNN acceleration is formulated and RISC-V is explored as the ISA of a multi-core system to bridge the gap between the memory and the DNN Processor in order to increase the entire system throughput. The experiment realizes a four-stage design of the RISC-V core, and further reveals that a multi-core design along with an appropriate scheduling algorithm can efficiently decrease the runtime and elevate the throughput. Moreover, the experiment also provides us with a constructive suggestion regarding the ideal proportion of the cores to Process Engines (PE), which provides us with significant assistance in building highly efficient AI System-on-Chips (SoCs) in resource-aware situations.},

Applications of AGR are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. However, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards AGR and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. To begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards AGR. We found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards AGR and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. They raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. We present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems.},

Emerging water sensing systems, however, can provide detailed usage data at the level of individual water fixtures (i.e., disaggregated usage data). In this paper, we perform formative evaluations of two sets of novel eco-feedback displays that take advantage of this disaggregated data. The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas).},

Our findings show that people seek to make abstract Smart Metering data accountable by connecting it to their everyday practices.

We systematically selected and analyzed 100 papers from recent years and while we found an increase of relevant UX studies, we also saw a remaining overlap with pure usability evaluations. Positive trends include an increasing percentage of field rather than lab studies and a tendency to combine several methods in UX studies. Triangulation was applied in more than two thirds of the studies, and the most common method combination was questionnaires and interviews. Based on our analysis, we derive common patterns for triangulation in UX evaluation efforts. A critical discussion about existing approaches should help to obtain stronger results, especially when evaluating new technologies.},

Inspired by $1's easy, cheap, and flexible design, we present the GestureWiz prototyping environment that provides designers with an integrated solution for gesture definition, conflict checking, and real-time recognition by employing human recognizers in a Wizard of Oz manner. We present a series of experiments with designers and crowds to show that GestureWiz can perform with reasonable accuracy and latency. We demonstrate advantages of GestureWiz when recreating gesture-based interfaces from the literature and conducting a study with 12 interaction designers that prototyped a multimodal interface with support for a wide range of novel gestures in about 45 minutes.},

abstract = {Funding bodies increasingly require researchers to address gender in their proposals ---often framed around binary notions. With power structures emboldening inequality highly prevalent and persuasive in Western societies, these seep into current practices of Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Hence, developing an increased awareness of our societal responsibility towards equity can be challenging without an appropriate starting point. We present a close reading of literature discussing gender sensitivity in HCI research to provide practical guidance in the form of recommendations for the design, proposal, conduct and presentation of research. Our analysis provides a starting point for HCI students and interested researchers to explore questions and issues around gender and to identify how gender relates to their research. This sensitisation may aid them in further reflecting on how they might better serve marginalised populations through their work.},

abstract = {Interaction design is playing an increasingly prominent role in computing research, while professional user experience roles expand. These forces drive the demand for more de- sign instruction in HCI classrooms. In this paper, we distill the popular approaches to teaching design to undergraduate and graduate students of HCI. Through a review of existing research on design pedagogy, an international survey of 61 HCI educators, and an analysis of popular textbooks, we ex- plore the prominent disciplinary perspectives that shape design education in the HCI classroom. We draw on our analyses to discuss the differences we see in forms of design taught, approaches to adapting design instruction in computing-based courses, and the tensions faced by instructors of these classes. We conclude by arguing for the importance of pedagogical research on design instruction as a vital and foundational area of inquiry in Interaction Design and HCI.},

abstract = {Despite the divisive nature of abortion within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, where access to safe, legal abortion is severely restricted, effecting legislative reform demands widespread public support. In light of a building pro-choice counter-voice, this work contributes to a growing body of HCI research that takes an activist approach to design. We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. Furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing 'stepping stones' to activism.},

abstract = {Informed by considerations from medicine and wellness research, experience design, investigations of new and emerging technologies, and sociopolitical critique, HCI researchers have demonstrated that women's health is a complex and rich topic. Turning these research outputs into productive interventions, however, is difficult. We argue that design is well positioned to address such a challenge thanks to its methodological traditions of problem setting and framing situated in synthetic (rather than analytic) knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on designing for experiences of menopause. Building on our prior empirical work on menopause and our commitment to pursue design informed by women's lived experience, we iteratively generated dozens of design frames and accompanying design crits. We document the unfolding of our design reasoning, showing how good-seeming insights nonetheless often lead to bad designs, while working progressively towards stronger insights and design constructs. The latter we offer as a contribution to researchers and practitioners who work at the intersections of women's health and design.},

Advocating for better, healthier implementations of these technologies will require us to communicate abstract values, such as trust, to an audience that ranges from the general public to technologists and even policymakers. In this paper, we show how a combination of film-making and product design can help to illustrate these abstract values. Working as part of a wider international advocacy campaign, Our Friends Electric focuses on the voice enabled internet, translating abstract notions of Internet Health into comprehensible digital futures for the relationship between our voice and the internet. We conclude with a call for designers of physical things to be more involved with the development of trust, privacy and security in this powerful emerging technological landscape.},

However, while traditional approaches usually draw on ethnography or psychology for the sociology component, the study reported on in this paper, inspired by the work being conducted within the emerging field of Critical Technical Practice, introduces cultural theory into the multi-disciplinary mix of a user centered design project.

abstract = {Route planning is a challenging problem for urban computing that usually involves the processing of a huge amount of data and collaborative user feedback. Traditionally, route planning services are street-based, that is, even paths for a pedestrian are suggested in terms of streets. However, such models are not suitable for users with certain disabilities. To address this problem, we have performed a requirement analysis with a group of wheelchair-users and their companions to understand their urban mobility experience. Given that perspective, we describe in this article a sidewalk-based model to accommodate the needs for a wheelchair route planning service. The model is mathematically defined as a graph, where the vertices are the city block corners and the edges are the sidewalks or crosswalks. The edge costs are derived from important accessibility features, such as distance, path inclination, and existence and maintenance conditions of curb ramps, crosswalks, and sidewalks. The model has been designed so that user feedback is considered to help updating the model when accessibility issues are detected, by wheelchair-users and companions, or solved, by the department of city planning. We also present a route planning algorithm that provides a set of alternative routes based on accessibility conditions, and a shortcut recommender algorithm to support accessibility-related decision making by the department of city planning. Experiments, by using PgRouting and PostGIS with open data, are reported for a Brazilian city neighborhood to validate the model and the route planning service.},

Through the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, it is possible to identify the evaluation approaches used, the instruments and the genres of these applications. From this, the state of the art was defined on the evaluation processes of TUI, contributing to the information base for proposing new evaluation methodologies that respect the particularities of the tangible interaction.},

However, validation of these measures is impossible without observable confirmation of behaviors. Participants have expressed discomfort during the use of ego-centric wearable cameras with first-person view. We argue that mounting the camera on different body locations with a different lens orientation, gives a device recording affordance that has the effect of reducing surveillance and social discomfort compared to ego-centric cameras. We call these types of cameras "activity-oriented" because they are designed to capture a particular activity, rather than the field of view of the wearer. We conducted an experiment of three camera designs with 24 participants, collecting qualitative data on participants' experience while wearing these devices in the wild. We provide a model explaining factors that lead to an increase in social presence and social stigma, which, therefore, create social and surveillance discomfort for the wearer. Wearers' attempts to reduce this discomfort by modifying their behavior or abandoning the device threatens the validity of observations of authentic behaviors. We discuss design implications and provide recommendations to help reduce social presence and stigma in order to improve the validity of observations with cameras in the wild.},

In addition, users desire agency and control in all aspects of the system. The participative approach we take is to iteratively co-develop prototypes with end users. Here we describe a case study of the co-development of one prototype, a digital stretch wristband that records interaction for later reflection called Snap. Snap has been designed to sit within a platform that allows the distributed and sustainable design, manufacture and data analysis of customizable digital health technologies. We contribute to HCI with (1) lessons learned from a DIY co-development process that follows the principles of modularity, participation and iteration and (2) the potential impact of technology in self-management of anxiety and the broader design implications of addressing unique anxiety experiences.},

Media professionals engage with researchers along the MPP to disseminate science news to the lay public. However, differing incentive structures and professional contexts frequently set researchers' values and needs at odds with those of media professionals, resulting in problematic or failed interactions. We ask the research question: what pain points in scientific media production afford opportunities for future HCI innovation? We then present a grounded theory analysis of 24 interviews with researchers and media professionals, yielding several key contributions. First, we describe two collaborative domains in scientific media production between research advocates and media outlets. Second, we characterize discrete technological gaps and pain points in both domains. Finally, we discuss implications for design and propose solutions from HCI areas like peer production, online communities, recommender systems, and online collaboration.},

Our work addresses this problem through three interrelated studies: (1) interviews with therapists to examine their current rehabilitation practices; (2) the design of the "ArmSleeve Sensor" to monitor a patient's upper limb movement; and (3) the design and evaluation of the "ArmSleeve Dashboard" to visualize this information for therapists. The findings show the importance of collecting objective data to assess exercise and activities outside therapy, but also a lack of contextual information to interpret this data. We discuss considerations for how to address this issue through patient engagement as well as considerations for designing wearable sensor technology that is usable in everyday life.},

abstract = {In late May, 2008, a group of database researchers, architects, users and pundits met at the Claremont Resort in Berkeley, California to discuss the state of the research field and its impacts on practice. This was the seventh meeting of this sort in twenty years, and was distinguished by a broad consensus that we are at a turning point in the history of the field, due both to an explosion of data and usage scenarios, and to major shifts in computing hardware and platforms. Given these forces, we are at a time of opportunity for research impact, with an unusually large potential for influential results across computing, the sciences and society. This report details that discussion, and highlights the group's consensus view of new focus areas, including new database engine architectures, declarative programming languages, the interplay of structured and unstructured data, cloud data services, and mobile and virtual worlds. We also report on discussions of the community's growth, including suggestions for changes in community processes to move the research agenda forward, and to enhance impact on a broader audience.},

However, a core challenge for patients is often to understand the connection between specific behaviors and health, i.e. to go beyond health awareness to disease insight. This paper presents MONARCA 2.0, which records subjective and objective data from patients suffering from bipolar disorder, processes this, and informs both the patient and clinicians on the importance of the different data items according to the patient's mood. The goal is to provide patients with a increased insight into the parameters influencing the nature of their disease.

These strategies help the tutor agent manage the attention of the students while delivering useful instructional content. Two technical challenges involving the use of social interaction strategies include determining the appropriate policy for triggering these strategies and regulating the amount of social behavior performed by the tutor. In this paper, a comparison of six different triggering policies is presented. We find that a triggering policy learnt from human behavior in combination with a filter that keeps the amount of social behavior comparable to that performed by human tutors offers the most effective solution to the these challenges.},

abstract = {As an answer to the disabled community’s odyssey to gain access to adaptable, modular, multilingual, cheap and sustainable Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) products, we propose the use of the ITHACA framework. It is a software environment for building component-based AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid---community and commercial---Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end users’ communication skills. Developers’ experience on working in ITHACA’s Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged.},

abstract = {Researchers and the media have become increasingly interested in protest users, or people who change (protest use) or stop (protest non-use) their use of a company's products because of the company's values and/or actions. Past work has extensively engaged with the phenomenon of technology non-use but has not focused on non-use (nor changed use) in the context of protest. With recent research highlighting the potential for protest users to exert leverage against technology companies, it is important for technology stakeholders to understand the prevalence of protest users, their motivations, and the specific tactics they currently use. In this paper, we report the results of two surveys (n = 463 and n = 398) of representative samples of American web users that examine if, how, and why people have engaged in protest use and protest non-use of the products of five major technology companies. We find that protest use and protest non-use are relatively common, with 30% of respondents in 2019 reporting they were protesting at least one major tech company. Furthermore, we identify that protest users' most common motivations were (1) concerns about business models that profit from user data and (2) privacy; and the most common tactics were (1) stopping use and (2) leveraging ad blockers. We also identify common challenges and roadblocks faced by active and potential protest users, which include (1) losing social connections and (2) the lack of alternative products. Our results highlight the growing importance of protest users in the technology ecosystem and the need for further social computing research into this phenomenon. We also provide concrete design implications for existing and future technologies to support or account for protest use and protest non-use.},

Through retrospective journals and field notes, we reveal the tensions and nuances in his travel, including the magnified difficulty of social conversations, issues with navigating unfamiliar environments and cultural contexts, and changes in the relationship to personal assistive technologies. By exploring the longitudinal travel experiences of a single individual, we uncover evocative and personal insights rarely available through participant-based research methods. Based on these lived experiences and post hoc reflections, we present two design explorations of personalized technology the autoethnographer created for aiding his travel. Finally, we offer reflections for customized travel technologies for deaf and hard of hearing users, and methodological guidelines for performing first-person research in the context of disability.},

For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

Because Formal Concept Analysis provides suitable knowledge structures to represent the variability of a given system family, we explore the relevance of Relational Concept Analysis, an FCA extension to take into account relationships between different families, to tackle this issue. We investigate a method to extract variability information from descriptions representing several inter-connected product families. It aims to be used to assist the design of inter-connected FMs, and to provide recommendations during product selection.},

abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: "should I calculate IRR?" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

Typical means of organizing community submissions, such as aggregating community or crowd votes, suffer from the cold-start problem, the rich-get-richer problem, and the sparsity problem. To circumvent those, our approach learns a ranking model that combines 1) community feedback, 2) idea uniqueness, and 3) text features?e.g., readability, coherence, semantics, etc. This model can then rank order submissions by expected quality, supporting community members in finding content that can inspire them and improve collaboration among members. As illustrative example, we demonstrate the model on OpenIDEO--a collaborative community where high-quality submissions are rewarded by winning design challenges. We find that the proposed ranking model finds winning ideas more effectively than existing ranking techniques (comment sorting), as measured using both Discounted Cumulative Gain and human perceptions of idea quality. We also identify the elements of winning ideas that were highly predictive of subsequent success: 1) engagement with community feedback, 2) submission length, and 3) a submission's uniqueness. Ultimately, our approach enables community members and managers to more effectively manage creative stimuli created by large collaborative communities.},

Yet, learning from-, and acting upon such data remain a challenge. The process of reflection has been identified as a key component of such learning. However, most tools do not explicitly design for reflection, carrying an implicit assumption that providing access to self-tracking data is sufficient. In this paper, we present Reflection Companion, a mobile conversational system that supports engaging reflection on personal sensed data, specifically physical activity data collected with fitness trackers. Reflection Companion delivers daily adaptive mini-dialogues and graphs to users' mobile phones to promote reflection. To generate our system's mini dialogues, we conducted a set of workshops with fitness trackers users, producing a diverse corpus of 275 reflection questions synthesized into a set of 25 reflection mini dialogues. In a 2-week field deployment with 33 active Fitbit users, we examined our system's ability to engage users in reflection through dialog. Results suggest that the mini-dialogues were successful in triggering reflection and that this reflection led to increased motivation, empowerment, and adoption of new behaviors. As a strong indicator of our system's value, 16 of the 33 participants elected to continue using the system for two additional weeks without compensation. We present our findings and describe implications for the design of technology-supported dialog systems for reflection on data.},

Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.},

abstract = {The notion of “movement qualities” is central in contemporary dance; it describes the manner in which a movement is executed. Movement qualities convey information revealing movement expressiveness; their use has strong potential for movement-based interaction with applications in arts, entertainment, education, or rehabilitation. The purpose of our research is to design and evaluate interactive reflexive visuals for movement qualities. The theoretical basis for this research is drawn from a collaboration with the members of the international dance company Emio Greco|PC to study their formalization of movement qualities. We designed a pedagogical interactive installation called Double Skin/Double Mind (DS/DM) for the analysis and visualization of movement qualities through physical model-based interactive renderings.In this article, we first evaluate dancers’ perception of the visuals as metaphors for movement qualities. This evaluation shows that, depending on the physical model parameterization, the visuals are capable of generating dynamic behaviors that the dancers associate with DS/DM movement qualities. Moreover, we evaluate dance students’ and professionals’ experience of the interactive visuals in the context of a dance pedagogical workshop and a professional dance training. The results of these evaluations show that the dancers consider the interactive visuals to be a reflexive system that encourages them to perform, improves their experience, and contributes to a better understanding of movement qualities. Our findings support research on interactive systems for real-time analysis and visualization of movement qualities, which open new perspectives in movement-based interaction design.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe four player roles in game-based learning and training, namely student player, student author, teacher player and teacher author. By this, we want to emphasise the creative and collaborative nature of gameplay, such as in-game feedback, scenario creation and "puckstering", that put students and teachers, not on opposite sides of a spectrum, but as members of a community of practice with varying degrees of expertise. Using these four player roles as a basis for analysis, we have observed training sessions for vocational education within military and rescue contexts. The result is multifaceted insights into both the strengths and draw-backs of incorporating these roles into a serious game.},

abstract = {Deaf individuals often experience communication difficulties in face-to-face interactions with hearing people. In order to support deaf individuals in such situations, an active stream of assistive technology (AT) research focuses on real-time translation of sign language. We investigate the impact of real-time translation-based ATs on communication quality between deaf and hearing individuals. We conducted a focus group and aWizard of Oz study in which deaf and hearing participants jointly interacted with different assistive technologies. We find that while ATs facilitate communication, communication quality is degraded by to breaks in the conversation. Using Co-Cultural Theory, we identify deaf people as a subordinate group inside a hearing society. Our results indicate that current ATs reinforce this subordination by emphasizing deficiency of mastering the dominant form of communication. Based on our findings, we propose a change in design perspective by enabling the hearing to sign rather than the deaf to "hear". We argue that ATs should not be seen as "just" a tool for the Deaf but rather as a collaborative technology.},

abstract = {As sensors and interactive devices become ubiquitous and transition outdoors and into the wild, we are met with the challenge of mass deployment and actuation. We present E-seed, a biomimetic platform that consumes little power to deploy, harvests energy from nature to install, and functions autonomously in the field. Each seed can individually self-drill into a substrate by harvesting moisture fluctuations in its ambient environment. As such, E-seed acts as a shape-changing interface to autonomously embed functional devices and interfaces into the soil, with the potential of aerial deployment in hard-to-reach locations. Our system is constructed primarily from wood veneer, making it lightweight, inexpensive, and biodegradable. In this paper, we detail our fabrication process and showcase demos that leverage the E-seed platform as a self-drilling interface. We envision that possible applications include soil sensors, sampling, and environmental monitoring for agriculture and reforestation.},

abstract = {Climate change is the defining challenge now facing our planet. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, as advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, requires rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in how governments, industries, and societies function by 2030. Computer Science plays an important role in these efforts, both in providing tools for greater understanding of climate science and in reducing the environmental costs of computing. It is vital for Computer Science students to understand how their chosen field can both exacerbate and mitigate the problem of climate change.We have reviewed the existing literature, interviewed leading experts, and held conversations at the ITiCSE 2019 conference, to identify how universities, departments, and CS educators can most effectively address climate change within Computer Science education. We find that the level of engagement with the issue is still low, and we discuss obstacles at the level of institutional, program and departmental support as well as faculty and student attitudes. We also report on successful efforts to date, and we identify responses, strategies, seed ideas, and resources to assist educators as they prepare their students for a world shaped by climate change.},

abstract = {For the most part, Information Architecture processes include sets of activities and techniques to be carried out by the development team to create interactive applications effectively, involving usability concerns at every development step. In fact, plenty of process models have already been proposed to bridge the gap between User-Centered Development and Information Architecture, empowering the development team to build usable applications successfully. However, the combination of User-Centered Development and Information Architecture paradigms sometimes results in cumbersome process models containing lots of phases and activities to be considered, which increases the cycle time to have partial and validated software increments readily. As less effort has been devoted to speed up the usable Information Architecture development, the aim of this paper is to address such problem. To do so, we present Scrum-UIA, an agile and usable development process driven by the Information Architecture. This process is intended to develop web applications by splitting up responsibilities and tasks, and decreasing the time to perform technical activities, in order to readily obtain usable software increments.},

abstract = {Assisted living technologies may help people live independently while also—potentially—reducing health and care costs. But they are notoriously difficult to implement at scale and many devices are abandoned following initial adoption. We report findings from a study of global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices intended to support the independent living of people with cognitive impairment. Our aims were threefold: to understand (through ethnography) such individuals’ lived experience of GPS tracking; to facilitate (through action research) the customization and adaptation of technologies and care services to provide effective, ongoing support; and to explore the possibilities for a co-production methodology that would enable people with cognitive impairment and their families to work with professionals and technical designers to shape these devices and services to meet their particular needs in a sustainable way. We found that the articulation work needed for maintaining the GPS technology in “working order” was extensive and ongoing. This articulation work does not merely supplement formal procedures, a lot of it is needed to get round them, but it is also often invisible and thus its importance goes largely unrecognized. If GPS technologies are to be implemented at scale and sustainably, methods must be found to capitalize on the skills and tacit knowledge held within the care network (professional and lay) to resolve problems, improve device design, devise new service solutions, and foster organizational learning.},

In this environment, it is not feasible to expect these developers to be expert in every security detail of the software they use, and we discuss how difficult it can be to build secure software. In this respect, the practical challenges of the emerging paradigm of developer-centered security are explored, where developers would be required to consider security from the perspective of those other developers who use their software. We question whether current user-centered security techniques are adequate for this task and suggest that new thinking will be required. Two directions---symmetry of ignorance and security archaeology-are offered as a new way to consider this challenge.},

abstract = {Collaborative crowd computing, e.g., human computation and crowdsourcing, involves a team of workers jointly solving tasks of varying difficulties. In such settings, the ability to manage the workflow based on workers' skills and task strains can improve output quality. However, many practical systems employ a simple additive scoring scheme to measure worker performance, and do not consider the task difficulty or worker interaction. Some prior works have looked at ways of measuring worker performance or task difficulty in collaborative settings, but usually assume sophisticated models. In our work, we address this question by taking a competitive perspective and leveraging the vast prior work on competitive games. We adapt TrueSkill's standard competitive model by treating the task as a fictitious worker that the team of humans jointly plays against. We explore two fast online approaches to estimate the worker and task ratings: (1) an ELO rating system, and (2) approximate inference with the Expectation Propagation algorithm. To assess the strengths and weaknesses of the various rating methods, we conduct a human study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk with a simulated ESP game. Our experimental design has the novel element of pairing a carefully designed bot with human workers; these encounters can be used, in turn, to generate a larger set of simulated encounters, yielding more data. Our analysis confirms that our ranking scheme performs consistently and robustly, and outperforms the traditional additive scheme in terms of predicted accuracy.},

However, studies addressing the industrial context are quite rare, and due to the diversity of machines, processes, tasks, personal motivations, teams and the specific organizational culture of companies, it is not sufficient to provide only consumption data. For an adequate consideration of these factors, detailed design guidelines and system concepts are currently missing. However, this study shows the potential that a common understanding of consumption data can emerge through suitable visualization to support everyday work and possibilities of data sharing. Therefore, we show exemplarily how a design can be derived from empirically collected requirements and how a system concept can look like that enrich current eco-feedback design research for the industrial context.},

Facing barriers of systemic oppression caused by government information control, transnational political tensions, and racial and ethnic discriminations, these civic technical communicators acted as forces of resistance to enact social justice-oriented technical communication. In this article, we propose a social justice-oriented, critically contextualized methodology to analyze such transcultural communications and perform a rhetorical genre analysis of example genres. We argue that these citizen communicators were transparent about their positionality and aware of their privileges when facilitating crisis communication and disaster relief in order to empower those marginalized in the dominant discourse and oppressed by official relief measures. We offer implications on critical practices for researchers, practitioners, and teachers of technical communication for engaging with social justice in transcultural crisis communication.},

abstract = {Cochlear implants have improved the lives of tens of thousands of the hearing impaired by providing sufficient auditory perception for speech, but these devices are far from satisfactory for music perception. Many cochlear implant recipients, especially pre-lingually deafened children, have difficulty recognizing and producing specific pitches. To improve musical auditory habilitation for children post cochlear implantation, we developed MOGAT: MObile Games with Auditory Training. The system includes three musical games built with off-the-shelf mobile devices to train their pitch perception and intonation skills respectively, and a cloud-based web service which allows music therapists to monitor and design individual training for children. The design of the games and web service was informed by a pilot survey (N=60 children). To ensure widespread use with low-cost mobile devices, we minimized the computation load while retaining highly accurate audio analysis. A 6-week user study (N=15 children) showed that the music habilitation with MOGAT was intuitive, enjoyable and motivating. It has improved most children's pitch discrimination and production, and several children's improvement was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).},

The millennial generation is known as the generation that has a high level of education, smart in using technology to solve everyday problems, an appropriate segment for a unicorn. However, what about their expectations for the start-up? Are these expectations are met or even violated? This study uses the paradigm of communication with expectancy violation theory to find out the expectancy and expectancy violation of the millennial generation as they use a start-up. Many studies that ignore the theoretical literature, especially in a mature company and the new company as a startup. Also, if associated with a business or economics, then the position of the consumer or target audience is crucial to obtain customer satisfaction.

abstract = {Use of chatbots in different spheres of life is continuously increasing since a couple of years. We attempt to understand the potential of chatbots for breastfeeding education by conducting an Wizard-of-Oz experiment with 22 participants. Our participants included breastfeeding mothers and community health workers from the slum areas of Delhi, India.We prototyped our chatbot as an interactive question-answering application and analyzed users' interaction patterns, perceptions, and contexts of use. The chatbot use cases emerged primarily as the first line of support. The participants, especially the mothers, were enthusiastic with the opportunity to ask questions and get reliable answers. We also observed the influencing role of female relative, e.g. mothers-in-law, in breastfeeding practices. Our analysis of user information-seeking suggests that a majority of questions (88%) are of nature that can be answered by a chatbot application. We further observe that the queries are embedded deeply into myths and existing belief systems. Therefore requiring the designers to focus on subtle aspects for providing information such as positive reinforcement and contextual sensitivity. Further, we discuss, different societal and ethical issues associated with Chatbot usage for a public health topic such as breastfeeding education.},

abstract = {This paper explores the phenomenon of young children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC; aged 5-8 years) detecting discrepancies (i.e. novel or rule-violating occurrences) in a virtual environment (VE), and their subsequent reactions. Analysis of existent video data of 8 children with ASC interacting with the ECHOES VE showed that they detected and reacted to a range of discrepancies. More importantly, these discrepancies motivated a range of positive, social initiations, such as sharing affect, commenting, and social referencing. These early results suggest that deliberately including discrepancies in VEs may motivate initiation for children in this group. However, little is known about the possible types of discrepancies that might exist in a VE, how this population understands them, and how they might practically be incorporated into future designs.},

SEO employs a multifaceted skillset, including an understanding of coding, skills in shaping and crafting effective user experience (UX), marketing skills, effective research strategies, and competence in accessibility. We argue that instruction in SEO in undergraduate and graduate programs in technical communication prepares graduates for the interdisciplinary and agile profession they seek to enter and enables them to be successful in positions from information architect to technical editor. Our article details how studying and enacting SEO helps students to develop proficiencies and knowledge central to technical communication pedagogies, including technological literacies, an understanding of the interconnections between human and non-human actors in digital spaces, and the ethical concerns central to work within those spaces. We then detail how SEO can be incorporated into technical communication curricula and share details of client-based projects that can facilitate that integration..},

abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

Our work using narrative methods has explored how university graduates make sense of their learning experiences and how these fit within their wider learning trajectories. In this paper, we discuss work we conducted with a group of a dozen students who, when first interviewed, were in the second half of their undergraduate education at Olin College of Engineering. All twelve participants were re-interviewed four years later, after they had graduated, using the same narrative protocol that asked them to describe their learning 'life' as if it was a book, and to identify and describe individual chapters of their experience. The pairs of interviews were analysed with respect to their form and their content. In regard to form, a classification of these repeated stories is derived. Thematic analysis of the content examines a) how students come to study and practice computing and b) the continuing, and changing influence of a university education over time, as students construct an individual sense of coherence.},

Firstly, it explores how not only digital and physical but also past and present as well as near and distant places might become entangled in such a hybrid city. Secondly, we speculate what it means if the digital traces of a person -- perhaps even his/her digitalized body -- continue "living" in a hybrid city after s/he has passed away. Thirdly, we raise questions regarding power: who owns the digital city, and who has the right to change it? Lastly, we ponder some sociocultural questions and design ideas opened up by the fiction.},

In this paper, what relevant information for PM and how that information can support the project management practices are presented, especially regarding risk management and people management. So, an exploratory study was performed applying Systematic Mapping of Literature technique. Contributions include the identification of 58 metrics, 4 sources of information, and 7 PM's activities supported by the measurement of developer work. In addition, aspects to be explored on the subject are presented, inspiring new studies in the field of Software Engineering.},

abstract = {Games have been designed to foster children's computational thinking (CT) skills, which is widely recognized as a key ability that should be mastered in this computing-driven era. Because learning coding skills is cognitively difficult and uninvolving for novices and it is recommended to learn CT concepts first, many educational games have been developed to teach CT in a non-coding environment. However, despite the breadth of such games and the demand for it, little is known about how to design such games or why such games are designed in a particular way. To address this gap, this paper presents a design framework that describes the building blocks for developing (non-coding) gameplay elements in games teaching CT. The framework focuses specifically on computational problem-solving because this is where games can specifically aid with. We illustrate the design framework through LittleWorld, a mobile game that teaches CT concepts through insects.},

abstract = {Clinical decision support tools (DSTs) are computational systems that aid healthcare decision-making. While effective in labs, almost all these systems failed when they moved into clinical practice. Healthcare researchers speculated it is most likely due to a lack of user-centered HCI considerations in the design of these systems. This paper describes a field study investigating how clinicians make a heart pump implant decision with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into their work process. Our findings reveal a lack of perceived need for and trust of machine intelligence, as well as many barriers to computer use at the point of clinical decision-making. These findings suggest an alternative perspective to the traditional use models, in which clinicians engage with DSTs at the point of making a decision. We identify situations across patients' healthcare trajectories when decision supports would help, and we discuss new forms it might take in these situations.},

To understand their efficacy for crisis response, we created the dpAid software system. Its design arose through a multi-year participation in medical crisis response training featuring realistic team simulations. A study comparing Dynamic Procedure Aids, paper, and no aid, found that participants with Dynamic Procedure Aids performed significantly better than with paper or no aid. This study introduces the narrative simulation paradigm for comparatively assessing expert procedural performance through a score-and-correct approach.},

We relied on the gained knowledge to design and develop novel visual interfaces that would communicate the overall status of the district heating system at-a-glance. We aimed at exploring potential directions and alternatives beyond conventional industrial interfaces. One particular aspect of our research was related to how the physicality of the underlying industrial processes can be expressed by purely visual means. The paper introduces three high-fidelity prototypes demonstrating the novel visualizations developed. The paper explains the design choices made, namely the relation between the selected visual encodings to the requirements of the industrial operators' tasks. Preliminary evaluation indicates industrial operators' interest in the designed solutions. Future work will incorporate an extensive qualitative evaluation on site.},

We designed an interactive sound installation that supports kinesthetic awareness of a participant's micro-movements. The installation's interaction design uses continuous auditory feedback and leverages an adaptive mapping strategy, refining its sensitivity to increase sonic resolution at lower levels of movement activity. The installation uses field recordings as rich source materials to generate a sound environment that attunes to a participant's micro-movements. Through a qualitative study using a second-person interview technique, we gained nuanced insights into the participants' subjective experiences of the installation. These reveal consistent temporal patterns, as participants build on a gradual process of integration to increase the complexity and capacity of their kinesthetic awareness during interaction.},

abstract = {Serious games have received much positive attention; correspondingly, many researchers have taken up the challenge of establishing how to best design them. However, the current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks. Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects: project organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives, to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open the conversation about them.},

Playtesting promises to help identify opportunities to improve player experience and assist developers in achieving their design intent. However, a lack of research on the added value of playtesting means that many studios are still uncertain about its commercial viability and impact on product success. This gap in understanding is further complicated by the vague definition of "success" afforded by sales figures and review scores. In this paper, we assess reported feature quality of three commercial titles by analyzing playtesting reports and game reviews. By comparing themes and design issues expressed in game reviews to the results of pre-release playtesting for each game, we aim to highlight the value of playtesting and propose a set of guidelines for selecting playtest methods based on the needs of a given game evaluation. Through the real-world case studies presented, this paper contributes to the growing domain of games user research and highlights the value of playtesting in game development.},

abstract = {Smart technologies have recently come under scrutiny for automating inequality. Given the current push towards developing and implementing smart cities policies that affect transportation systems in places like Kampala and Kigali, it is important to examine how the different modes of transportation meet the needs of diverse passengers and identify opportunities for technology to address any inequities. Prior studies have focused on the impact of informal public transportation on government policy and examined drivers' perspectives, but they largely overlooked the experiences of passengers and other industry stakeholders. In this study, we conducted interviews and surveys with public transportation riders with different disabilities as well as other stakeholders, including transport and financial technology creators. Our findings illuminate inequities in the transportation system surrounding discrimination and harassment, influence of ability on preferred transportation modes despite inaccessible interfaces, and influence of perceived social hierarchical structures on innovation. We present insights into how passengers appropriate technology to overcome challenges, and we uncover opportunities for technology to fill additional gaps. Lastly, we discuss how these findings support emergent frameworks such as aspiration-based design, and we present potential envisioned futures of technology for informal public transportation.},

abstract = {The proliferation of varied types of multi-user interactive surfaces (such as digital whiteboards, tabletops and tangible interfaces) is opening a new range of applications in face-to-face (f2f) contexts. They offer unique opportunities for Learning Analytics (LA) by facilitating multi-user sensemaking of automatically captured digital footprints of students' f2f interactions. This paper presents an analysis of current research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions: the orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity, challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar areas and LA applications.},

abstract = {Text-rich heterogeneous information networks (text-rich HINs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Hypernymy, also known as is-a relation or subclass-of relation, lays in the core of many knowledge graphs and benefits many downstream applications. Existing methods of hypernymy discovery either leverage textual patterns to extract explicitly mentioned hypernym-hyponym pairs, or learn a distributional representation for each term of interest based its context. These approaches rely on statistical signals from the textual corpus, and their effectiveness would therefore be hindered when the signals from the corpus are not sufficient for all terms of interest. In this work, we propose to discover hypernymy in text-rich HINs, which can introduce additional high-quality signals. We develop a new framework, named HyperMine, that exploits multi-granular contexts and combines signals from both text and network without human labeled data. HyperMine extends the definition of "context" to the scenario of text-rich HIN. For example, we can define typed nodes and communities as contexts. These contexts encode signals of different granularities and we feed them into a hypernymy inference model. HyperMine learns this model using weak supervision acquired based on high-precision textual patterns. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperMine and the utility of modeling context granularity. We further show a case study that a high-quality taxonomy can be generated solely based on the hypernymy discovered by HyperMine.},

This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. We conclude with design considerations for therapeutic VR systems.},

Our focus is on group play, particularly on the problems and opportunities that arise from mixed-visual-ability scenarios. These show that people with visual impairments are playing diverse games, but face limitations in playing with others who have different visual abilities. What stands out is the lack of intersection in gaming opportunities, and consequently, in habits and interests of people with different visual abilities.

abstract = {The last decades have seen a growing interest and demand for community-centered collaborative systems and platforms. These systems and platforms aim to provide an environment in which users can collaboratively create, share, and manage resources. While offering attractive opportunities for online collaboration and information sharing, they also open several security and privacy issues. This has attracted several research efforts toward the design and implementation of novel access control solutions that can handle the complexity introduced by collaboration. Despite these efforts, transition to practice has been hindered by the lack of maturity of the proposed solutions. The access control mechanisms typically adopted by commercial collaborative systems like online social network websites and collaborative editing platforms, are still rather rudimentary and do not provide users with a sufficient control over their resources. This survey examines the growing literature on access control for collaborative systems centered on communities, and identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to facilitate the adoption of collaborative access control solutions in real-life settings. Based on the literature study, we delineate a roadmap for future research in the area of access control for community-centered collaborative systems.},

abstract = {Fast Internet connections and fast development of the high performance graphic cards make the application of Distributed Virtual Environment systems more and more common today. In order to build a cost-effective DVE system, how to solve the partitioning problem is the key problem. Especially, with the application of web based DVE systems, the partitioning algorithms have to fulfill the requirement of real-time and quick-response. Also, in web based DVE systems, the avatars are always clustered distribution, so the partitioning algorithm should be able to deal with this situation in high efficiency. In order to solve the partitioning problem in web based DVE systems, this paper proposes a dynamic adjustment partitioning algorithm which imports dynamic weights of computational cost and communication cost and also takes into account the factor of CPU utilization, and can deal with the changes of the avatars' states dynamically in a short execution time. Also, this algorithm tends to assign avatars of a high density area in a DVE system to a single server, in this way, the inter-server messages can be reduced. Therefore, this quick-response algorithm can serve the web based DVE systems very well and the scalability and efficiency of the DVE systems has been improved.},

They facilitate understanding of human developers’ needs and activities, and thus can serve as a valuable resource to researchers designing software engineering tools. Furthermore, theories abstract beyond specific methods and tools to fundamental principles that can be applied to new situations. Toward filling this gap, we investigate the applicability and utility of Information Foraging Theory (IFT) for understanding information-intensive software engineering tasks, drawing upon literature in three areas: debugging, refactoring, and reuse. In particular, we focus on software engineering tools that aim to support information-intensive activities, that is, activities in which developers spend time seeking information. Regarding applicability, we consider whether and how the mathematical equations within IFT can be used to explain why certain existing tools have proven empirically successful at helping software engineers. Regarding utility, we applied an IFT perspective to identify recurring design patterns in these successful tools, and consider what opportunities for future research are revealed by our IFT perspective.},

abstract = {Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new approach to the development of mobile applications (apps) which was proposed by Google in 2015. It combines technology resources of both web and native apps. Meta-design is an End-User Development (EUD) approach from which end-users participate actively in a system's design process. Yet, PWAs are a recent technology and the impacts of associating EUD and PWAs has been little exploited. As the traditional PWA approach is limited regarding users acting as co-designers, we propose the PWA-EU approach, an extension of the traditional PWA architecture that includes EUD concepts. PWA-EU provides contributions in two lenses. First, the proposal was designed to be used by developers on the design/development time. Second, the app developed using PWA-EU approach will allow end-users to select design preferences, which makes them participants of the app's design. This active participation of end-users on the design is possible due to the meta-design concepts present on the PWA-EU approach. In this article, we present the PWA-EU approach and its evaluation in the perspective of developers/designers. For the evaluation, we grouped participants according to their professional background. The results also indicate that novice developers had a reasonable performance with only one hour of training.We conclude that even novice developers could achieve better performance in a real-life environment, in which they would have more time.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop the notion of design archives to understand how different forms of knowledge are systematically accumulated and shared in and across design processes. Drawing on philosophy and media theory, we present a working definition of design archives as more than documentation. Through an interview study, we investigate how various archives systematically inform design work and govern the way design processes are represented and reflected upon. The study provides insights into an abundance of tools used to access, record, store and share information. We highlight the difference between personal, shared, and public archives, different archival barriers for sharing, how prototypes act as (an)archival conduits of design potentials, and how information (and people) tend to get lost in the archives. Finally, we discuss how a design archival approach might help identify power relations in design while also facilitating a move from 'dead' to 'living' archives in design work.},

abstract = {Voice-activated personal assistants (VAPAs) are becoming smaller, cheaper, and more accurate, such that they are now prevalent in homes (e.g., Amazon Echo, Sonos One) and on mobile devices (e.g., Google Assistant, Apple Siri) around the world. VAPAs offer considerable potential to individuals who are blind, offering efficiencies over gesture-based input on touchscreen devices. However, research is just beginning to reveal the ways in which these technologies are used by people who are blind. In the first of two studies, we interviewed 14 blind adults with experience of home and/or mobile-based VAPAs, surfacing myriad accessibility, usability, and privacy issues for this community. A second study analyzing podcast content from 28 episodes relating to blind interactions with VAPAs was then undertaken to validate and extend findings from the first study. In addition to verifying prior findings, we learned that blind users wanted to leverage VAPAs for more productivity-oriented tasks and increased efficiency over other interaction modalities. We conclude that (1) VAPAs need to support a greater variety of AI personas, each specializing in a specific type of task; (2) VAPAs need to maintain continuity of voice interaction for both usability and accessibility; and (3) blind VAPA users, and especially blind technology podcasters, are expert voice interface users who should be incorporated into design processes from the beginning. We argue that when the blind lead the sighted through voice interface design, both blind and sighted users can benefit.},

This paper describes our experience designing, implementing, and trying to evaluate a robotics curriculum and program for all the students within an elementary school; the primary focus of this paper is scale. We describe challenges and opportunities we experienced as part of this project and reflect on the degree to which they are unique to our relatively small, isolated rural town and the timing of our project.

For example, Wikipedia, one of the most visited platforms on the Web, hosts thousands of user-generated articles and undergoes 12 million edits/contributions per month. User-generated content is undoubtedly one of the keys to its success but also a hindrance to good quality. Although Wikipedia has established guidelines for the “perfect article,” authors find it difficult to assert whether their contributions comply with them and reviewers cannot cope with the ever-growing amount of articles pending review. Great efforts have been invested in algorithmic methods for automatic classification of Wikipedia articles (as featured or non-featured) and for quality flaw detection. Instead, our contribution is an interactive tool that combines automatic classification methods and human interaction in a toolkit, whereby experts can experiment with new quality metrics and share them with authors that need to identify weaknesses to improve a particular article. A design study shows that experts are able to effectively create complex quality metrics in a visual analytics environment. In turn, a user study evidences that regular users can identify flaws, as well as high-quality content based on the inspection of automatic quality scores.},

The cases are chosen to demonstrate the range of the application of user studies in computer graphics (for examle, in developing better algorithms and in evaluating images and interaction techniques.The first part of the course summarizes the different types of studies that are appropriate at different times during development of a user-interface technique. The second part uses examples from the evaluation of graphics to illustrate the different techniques that can be used to assess perceived image quality and preference. It includes some well-known techniques such as ranking and introduces novel concepts such as maximum-likelihood difference scaling.The third part reviews how eye tracking can support user studies. Eye tracking is useful as an interaction device in virtual environments, but it can also be a helpful tool in usability testing and evaluation of algorithms and techniques.

We present an exploration of modelling an example ubiquitous system, the Savannah game, using the mathematical formalism of bigraphs, which are based on a universal process algebra that encapsulates both dynamic and spatial behaviour of autonomous agents that interact and move among each other, or within each other. We establish a modelling approach based on four perspectives on ubiquitous systems—Computational, Physical, Human, and Technology—and explore how these interact with one another. We show how our model explains observed inconsistencies in user trials of Savannah, and then, how formal analysis reveals an incompleteness in design and guides extensions of the model and/or possible system re-design to resolve this.},

abstract = {Elementary computer science has gained increasing attention within the computer science education research community. We have only recently begun to explore the many unanswered questions about how young students learn computer science, how they interact with each other, and how their skill levels and backgrounds vary. One set of unanswered questions focuses on gender equality for young computer science learners. This paper examines how the gender composition of collaborative groups in elementary computer science relates to student achievement. We report on data collected from an in-school 5th grade computer science elective offered over four quarters in 2014-2015. We found a significant difference in the quality of artifacts produced by learner groups depending upon their gender composition, with groups of all female students performing significantly lower than other groups. Our analyses suggest important factors that are influential as these learners begin to solve computer science problems. This new evidence of gender disparities in computer science achievement as young as ten years of age highlights the importance of future study of these factors in order to provide effective, equitable computer science education to learners of all ages.},

At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger's Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm's history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.},

Thus, technologies such as motion tracking have been used to augment what a physical mirror can provide. Current augmented mirrors, however, only implement one mode of communication, usually visual, and do not provide a holistic feedback to dancers that includes all the feedback elements commonly used in ballet classes. We conducted a mixed-method study with 16 novices and 16 expert dancers in which we compared two different modes of communication (visual and verbal), two different types of feedback (value and corrective) and two levels of guidance (mirror, or no mirror). Participants' ballet technique scores were evaluated by a remote teacher on eight ballet combinations (tendue, adagio, pirouette, saute, pli\'{e}, degage, frappe and battement tendue). We report quantitative and qualitative results that show how the level of guidance, mode of communication, and type of feedback, needs to be tuned in different ways for novices and experts.},

We develop a questionnaire to detect perceived strangers and friend abuse. We train supervised learning algorithms to predict questionnaire responses using features extracted from the mutual activities with Facebook friends. In our experiments, participants recruited from a crowdsourcing site agreed with 78% of the defense actions suggested by AbuSniff, without having to answer any questions about their friends. When compared to a control app, AbuSniff significantly increased the willingness of participants to take a defensive action against friends. AbuSniff also increased the participant self-reported willingness to reject friend invitations from strangers and abusers, their awareness of friend abuse implications, and their perceived protection from friend abuse.},

A series of empirical game experiments are presented and the player-based communication analyzed, with the aim of clarifying how format (media of expression) impacts on verbal communication in multiplayer games; as well as examining player communication in general. The results show distinct differences in the communication patterns between the two game formats, directly related to the limitations and requirements of the tabletop and digital media utilized, for example in the amount of “in-character” communication. Interplayer communication in both formats is highly focused on functional content, that is, oriented towards supporting practical gameplay; however, functional content has different meanings on the two platforms. These and other results are discussed in the context of format differences and in the larger context of the functions of verbal communication during the playing of multiplayer games.},

A problem with parameter tweaking is that it often requires much time and effort to explore a high-dimensional parameter space. We present a new technique to analyze such high-dimensional parameter space to obtain a distribution of human preference. Our method uses crowdsourcing to gather pairwise comparisons between various parameter sets. As a result of analysis, the user obtains a goodness function that computes the goodness value of a given parameter set. This goodness function enables two interfaces for exploration: Smart Suggestion, which provides suggestions of preferable parameter sets, and VisOpt Slider, which interactively visualizes the distribution of goodness values on sliders and gently optimizes slider values while the user is editing. We created four applications with different design parameter spaces. As a result, the system could facilitate the user's design exploration.},

It draws on a 10-month participatory ethnography among a robotics company, an anthropologist, and a social robotics research lab. In contrast to psychological methods, this anthropological participatory ethnography integrates all stakeholders’ insights, offering holistic understandings of robots’ in situ operations throughout the fieldwork, data-sharing, interviews, and analysis. In particular, this article unravels employee social constructions of the company’s self-driving factory transport vehicles, “the robots.” These robots are deployed across a variety of warehouses and factories in North America. Our results involve an assessment of six teams at the robotics company’s headquarters: those testing robots, those developing their hardware and software, and those working with customers. We unpack trends of anthropomorphism for each of these teams and across the company.},

abstract = {Network telemetry is essential for administrators to monitor massive data traffic in a network-wide manner. Existing telemetry solutions often face the dilemma between resource efficiency (i.e., low CPU, memory, and bandwidth overhead) and full accuracy (i.e., error-free and holistic measurement). We break this dilemma via a network-wide architectural design OmniMon, which simultaneously achieves resource efficiency and full accuracy in flow-level telemetry for large-scale data centers. OmniMon carefully coordinates the collaboration among different types of entities in the whole network to execute telemetry operations, such that the resource constraints of each entity are satisfied without compromising full accuracy. It further addresses consistency in network-wide epoch synchronization and accountability in error-free packet loss inference. We prototype OmniMon in DPDK and P4. Testbed experiments on commodity servers and Tofino switches demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniMon over state-of-the-art telemetry designs.},

abstract = {Model comparison has been widely used to support many tasks in model-driven software development. For this reason, many techniques of comparing them have been proposed in the last few decades. However, academia and industry have overlooked a classification of currently available approaches to the comparison of design models. Hence, a thorough understanding of state-of-the-art techniques remains limited and inconclusive. This article, therefore, focuses on providing a classification and a thematic analysis of studies on the comparison of software design models. We carried out a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer nine research questions. In total, 56 primary studies (out of 4,132) were selected from 10 widely recognized electronic databases after a careful filtering process. The main results are that a majority of the primary studies (1) provide coarse-grained techniques of the comparison of general-purpose diagrams, (2) adopt graphs as principal data structure and compare software design models considering structural properties only, (3) pinpoint commonalities and differences between software design models rather than assess their similarity, and (4) propose new techniques while neglecting the production of empirical knowledge from experimental studies. Finally, this article highlights some challenges and directions that can be explored in upcoming studies.},

abstract = {The development of the K--12 Computer Science Framework was led by the Association for Computing Machinery, Code.org, Computer Science Teachers Association, Cyber Innovation Center, and National Math and Science Initiative in collaboration with states, school districts, and the computer science education community. The framework was developed to inform the development of standards and curriculum, build capacity for teaching computer science, and guide the implementation of computer science pathways. The framework promotes a vision in which all students critically engage in computer science issues; approach problems in innovative ways; and create computational artifacts with a practical, personal, or societal intent. The K--12 Computer Science Framework comes at a time when our nation's education systems are adapting to a 21st century vision of students who are not just computer users but also computationally literate creators who are proficient in the concepts and practices of computer science. The framework provides a unifying vision to guide computer science from a subject for the fortunate few to an opportunity for all.}

abstract = {We present GPkit, a Python toolkit for Geometric and Signomial Programming that prioritizes explainability and incremental complexity. GPkit was designed through an ethnographic approach in the firms, classrooms, and research labs where it became part of the fabric of daily engineering work. Organizations have approached GPkit both in ways which centralize and in ways which distribute design work, usecases which emerged from and inspired new toolkit features. This two-way flow between mathematical structure and practitioner knowledge resulted in several novel contributions to the formulation and interpretation of convex programs and to our understanding of early-stage engineering design. For example, dual solutions (often considered incidental) can be more valuable to a design process than the "optimal design" itself, and we present novel algorithms and design methods based on this insight.},

It is motivated both by promising advances in voice-input technology, and a long-standing vision in the community to augment scientific processes with voice-based agents. Through a reflection on our design process and a limited but fully functional prototype, Vitro, we find that scientists wanted a voice-enabled device that acted not a lab assistant, but lab equipment. Second, we discovered that such a device would need to be deeply embedded in the physical and social space in which it served scientists. Finally, we discovered that scientists preferred a device that supported their practice of "careful deviation" from protocols in their lab work. Through this research, we contribute implications for the design of voice-enabled systems in workplace settings.},

abstract = {This paper tells the story of the development of BETA: a programming language with just one abstraction mechanism, instead of one abstraction mechanism for each kind of program element (classes, types, procedures, functions, etc.). The paper explains how this single abstraction mechanism, the pattern, came about and how it was designed to be so powerful that it covered the other mechanisms.In addition to describing the technical challenge of capturing all programming elements with just one abstraction mechanism, the paper also explains how the language was based upon a modeling approach, so that it could be used for analysis, design and implementation. It also illustrates how this modeling approach guided and settled the design of specific language concepts.The paper compares the BETA programming language with other languages and explains how such a minimal language can still support modeling, even though it does not have some of the language mechanisms found in other object-oriented languages.Finally, the paper tries to convey the organization, working conditions and social life around the BETA project, which turned out to be a lifelong activity for Kristen Nygaard, the authors of this paper, and many others.},

In this paper, we study how to motivate groups of workers by paying them equitably. To this end, we characterize existing collaborative tasks based on the types of information available to crowd workers. Then, we apply concepts from equity theory to show how fair payments relate to worker motivation, and we propose two theoretically grounded classes of fair payments. Finally, we run two experiments using an audio transcription task on Amazon Mechanical Turk to understand how workers perceive these payments. Our results show that workers recognize fair and unfair payment divisions, but are biased toward payments that reward them more. Additionally, our data suggests that fair payments could lead to a small increase in worker effort. These results inform the design of future collaborative crowdsourcing tasks.},

Addressing these challenges, Blossom aims at three design objectives: accessibility, flexibility, and expressiveness. The robot’s mechanism can be quickly assembled and partially extended by end-users. Blossom’s appearance is open-ended through handcrafted fabric exteriors created and customized by users. Smooth organic movements are achieved with tensile mechanisms, elastic components, and a soft exterior cover attached loosely to the body. Blossom’s smartphone-based gesture generation requires neither programming nor character animation experience, allowing lay users to create their own behaviors. All elements in the design were conceived with a low barrier-of-entry in mind. The result is an accessible and customizable social robot for researchers. This article details the implementation of Blossom’s design and demonstrates the platform’s potential through four field deployment case studies.},

abstract = {AppleScript is a scripting language and environment for the Mac OS. Originally conceived in 1989, AppleScript allows end users to automate complex tasks and customize Mac OS applications. To automate tasks, AppleScript provides standard programming language features (control flow, variables, data structures) and sends Apple Events to invoke application behavior. Apple Events are a variation on standard remote procedure calls in which messages can identify their arguments by queries that are interpreted by the remote application. This approach avoids the need for remote object pointers or proxies, and reduces the number of communication round trips, which are expensive in high latency environments like the early Macintosh OS. To customize an application that uses AppleScript's Open Scripting Architecture, users attach scripts to application objects; these scripts can then intercept and modify application behavior.AppleScript was designed for casual users: AppleScript syntax resembles natural language, and scripts can be created easily by recording manual operations on a graphical interface. AppleScript also supported internationalization in allowing script to be presented in multiple dialects, including English, Japanese, or French. Although the naturalistic syntax is easy to read, it can make scripts much more difficult to write.Early adoption was hindered by the difficulty of modifying applications to support Apple Events and the Open Scripting Architecture. Yet AppleScript is now widely used and is an essential differentiator of the Mac OS. AppleScript's communication model is a precursor to web services, and the idea of embedded scripting has been widely adopted.},
