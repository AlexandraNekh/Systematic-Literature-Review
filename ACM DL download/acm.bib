abstract = {This first workshop on explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts) brings together a community of researchers and creative practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interaction Design, AI, explainable AI (XAI), and Digital Arts to explore the role of XAI for the Arts. XAI is a core concern of Human-Centred AI and relies heavily on HCI techniques to explore how complex and difficult to understand AI models such as deep learning techniques can be made more understandable to people. However, XAI research has primarily focused on work-oriented and task-oriented explanations of AI and there has been little research on XAI for creative domains such as the Arts. This workshop will: i) build an XAIxArts research community; ii) map out the current and future possible landscapes of XAIxArts; iii) critically reflect on the potential of XAI for the Arts, forming the basis for an edited book on XAIxArts and an international network of researchers.},

abstract = {Technologies based on AI/ML are playing an increasingly prominent role in teenagers’ everyday lives. Mirroring this trend is a concomitant interest in teaching young people about intelligent technologies. Whereas previous research in the field of Child–Computer Interaction has proposed curriculum and learning activities that describe what teenagers need to learn about AI/ML, there is still a shortage of studies which specifically address teenager-centered perspectives in the teaching of AI/ML. This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

abstract = {From healthcare to criminal justice, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.},

With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI also becomes essential in AR because end-users will frequently interact with intelligent services. However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses when, what, and how to provide explanations of AI output in AR. The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users’ preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. XAIR’s utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users. XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.},

abstract = {The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to self-explain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

However, charting this gap is challenging. In the context of XAI, we argue that charting the gap improves our problem understanding, which can reflexively provide actionable insights to improve explainability. Utilizing two case studies in distinct domains, we empirically derive a framework that facilitates systematic charting of the sociotechnical gap by connecting AI guidelines in the context of XAI and elucidating how to use them to address the gap. We apply the framework to a third case in a new domain, showcasing its affordances. Finally, we discuss conceptual implications of the framework, share practical considerations in its operationalization, and offer guidance on transferring it to new contexts. By making conceptual and practical contributions to understanding the sociotechnical gap in XAI, the framework expands the XAI design space.},

abstract = {The recent focus on user-driven innovation and open innovation signals a shift of concerns beyond the new product or service it self. The very model of how to make business is at play in most innovation projects today, in particular with the advent of Internet commerce. There are already examples of participatory design methods being applied to open up the process of business modeling to a wider circle of actors than those marketing managers that typically devise new business schemes. Traditional manufacturing companies with conventional product sales are challenged to consider alternative business models. Public organizations are under increasing pressure to consider themselves a business, with all that this entails in terms of new terminology.To allow people without formal business education to take part in business model discussions means moving beyond text and spreadsheets. Designers can play a crucial role here. But participatory design of business models could sound like a contradiction in terms: Do the designers side with the exploiting rather than the exploited?This workshop invites participants to bring experience from projects where business issues were part of the participatory negotiation, and to hone their position on the larger question of the role of PD in innovation.},

Computational alternatives are used to systematically question the technological status quo and peak into a possible future; they are material manifestations of our focus and curiosity and can aid us in inquiring into possible socio-technical alternatives. Ultimately we focus on whether (and how) it is possible to maintain a technological research agenda in participatory and user-centered design, without giving up on pursuit of strong conceptual and theoretical insights.},

In this paper, we examine a notable yet understudied AI design process in the legal domain that took place over a decade ago, the impact of which still informs legal automation efforts today. Specifically, we examine the design and evaluation activities that took place from 2006 to 2011 within the Text REtrieval Conference's (TREC) Legal Track, a computational research venue hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The Legal Track of TREC is notable in the history of AI research and practice because it relied on a range of participatory approaches to facilitate the design and evaluation of new computational techniques-in this case, for automating attorney document review for civil litigation matters. Drawing on archival research and interviews with coordinators of the Legal Track of TREC, our analysis reveals how an interactive simulation methodology allowed computer scientists and lawyers to become co-designers and helped bridge the chasm between computational research and real-world, high-stakes litigation practice. In analyzing this case from the recent past, our aim is to empirically ground contemporary critiques of AI development and evaluation and the calls for greater participation as a means to address them.},

abstract = {Applications of artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) are dynamic and rapidly growing, and although multi-purpose, are particularly consequential in health care. One strategy for anticipating and addressing ethical challenges related to AI/ML for health care is co-design - or involvement of end users in design. Co-design has a diverse intellectual and practical history, however, and has been conceptualized in many different ways. Moreover, the unique features of AI/ML introduce challenges to co-design that are often underappreciated. This review summarizes the research literature on involvement in health care and design, and informed by critical data studies, examines the extent to which co-design as commonly conceptualized is capable of addressing the range of normative issues raised by AI/ML for health. We suggest that AI/ML technologies have amplified existing challenges related to co-design, and created entirely new challenges. We outline five co-design 'myths and misconceptions' related to AI/ML for health that form the basis for future research and practice. We conclude by suggesting that the normative strength of a co-design approach to AI/ML for health can be considered at three levels: technological, health care system, and societal. We also suggest research directions for a 'new era' of co-design capable of addressing these challenges.Link to full text: https://bit.ly/3yZrb3y},

abstract = {eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models, and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique, and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback, with a two-fold outcome: first, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users’ trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so that we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.},

The canvases can be applied in different parts of the design process to facilitate collaboration between experts of different fields, as well as to incorporate prospective users of the robot into the design process. We investigate the usability of the proposed canvases with two social robot design case studies: a robot that played games online with teenage users and a librarian robot that guided users at a public library. We observe through participants’ feedback that the canvases have the advantages of (1) providing structure, clarity, and a clear process to the design; (2) encouraging designers and users to share their viewpoints to progress toward a shared one; and (3) providing an educational and enjoyable design experience for the teams.},

As such, while our sampling is small, these interviewees are a good representation of the relevant individuals who hold sway over the thoughts, visions, ideas and challenges that are recognized in their respective organizations. We ask, how do these individuals understand AI and gauged through their views, how are these cities prepared for the increasing and continuous infusion of artificial intelligence technologies in these cities’ agendas, practices and projects?},

The data of 2939 abstracts were collected from 14 academic search engines and databases. With the presented method, we were able to identify six education-related clusters of PD articles. Furthermore, we point out that the identified clusters cover the majority of education-related words in the whole data. This is the first attempt to systematically map the participatory design literature. We argue that by continuing our work, we can help to perceive a coherent structure in the body of PD research.},

abstract = {We reflect on how practices of care configure workplace participatory design (PD) efforts by locating ways in which care manifests in the ambitions of actors as they confront their ambivalent relations to a smart workplace technology. We explore these issues through a participatory design effort centered around the development and implementation of a machine learning (ML) system to support the work of IT architects employed by a large global company. Following an Agile approach, these IT architects actively shaped the project's trajectories, offering feedback on various system prototypes as well as the alignment between the project's various aims and their everyday work practices. Our findings center around six standpoints (strategizing, managing, building, researching, integrating, and transforming) that organize “matters of care” emerging from our twenty-three-month-long engagement with this project. Workers inhabited different standpoints at different times (and some, at times, simultaneously), revealing a dynamic and shifting orientation toward caring. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding contemporary workplace PD efforts.},

Decolonising discourses teach us that we need to move away from the universalising ‘grand narratives’ of knowledge production and focus on contextualising diverse and situated experiences, epistemologies and narratives. Yet, few contributions actively demonstrate what a shift to decolonising PD means in practice. This interactive workshop will invigorate the gap in PD debates of decolonisation by bringing together and demonstrating how participatory designers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes, concepts, methodologies and sensibilities of PD into decolonising practices. These practices not only create new shifts and worldviews, but have potential for developing truly transcultural and transdisciplinary PD approaches},

abstract = {In Spain, the majority of university students are women, but the gender distribution in different fields of study is uneven and there are certain disciplines, as engineering and some experimental sciences where less than 30% are women. This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies. In this document we analyze the degree of introduction of the gender perspective in the AI grades and how to improve the gender competences of the students},

This year's PDC in Windhoek, Namibia provides the context for a panel discussion focused on opportunities and challenges for adopting participatory approaches that situate technology-enabled innovations in Africa's distinct and varied locales. Many technology organizations recently have established research, design, and development centers in Africa and have initiated projects with the desire to engage the talent and imaginative futures of this diverse region. This panel brings together researchers and practitioners working in Africa who are helping to direct their organizations efforts to locate the "center of design" in the settings and milieu where they work. Panelist will offer their perspectives on what it has meant for them and their organization to situate research, design, and development in Africa with a focus on their efforts to integrate participatory approaches. In addition they will discuss how to strengthen ties among their organizations, academic researchers, and institutions that are committed to participatory design and development to address the particular challenges of the African region.},

In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as "designers" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies.},

There tends to be a fracture in HRI between the technical designers of robot programs (often engineers or computer scientists) and the actual users of such robots. Developers have the capabilities to program robots but often lack insights possessed by domain experts, sometimes leading to technically interesting but impractical systems. With this workshop, we aim to bridge two different methods often used individually within the wider HRI community to involve end users in robot program design: Participatory Design (PD) and End-User Programming (EUP). Both methods empower end users to co-produce robots addressing real-world needs. However, there have been limited opportunities to unite researchers who specialize in these areas and engage in mutual learning. We will address this shortcoming with a full-day workshop, which will put the PD and EUP communities in touch, inviting speakers from both sides and welcoming a wide range of publications from describing new end-user programming methods to compiling insights learned from conducting participatory design studies.},

abstract = {Involving a school teacher in the development of the intelligent writing tutor StoryStation allowed progress to be made on the problem of story classication. An experienced Scottish school-teacher developed a rating scale and guidelines for StoryStation's automated plot analysis agent for the story rewriting task. In this task, pupils rewrite a story in their own words, allowing them to devote their full attention to improving their writing technique instead of creating a new plot. If the pupil forgets or confuses parts of the plot, the software needs to be able to detect this so that it may alert the pupil or their teacher. Teacher participation in the creation of the rating scale guided both the development of the tools used to analyze the stories and the scope of the plot analysis agent. A teacher and a story-teller rated the corpus, and this scale was used to successfully train the agent to classify both ''good'' and ''poor'' stories. Classification of ''excellent'' and ''fair'' stories proved to be very difficult. A number of facets of story understanding are shown to be beyond the range of the automated plot analysis agent and the advantages and disadvantages of automated plot analysis are weighed, including social factors.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) must increasingly be able to serve various global contexts. Overall, a fundamental need has been identified in the PD community to raise previously unheard global voices in design and development work, and to bring various underrepresented stakeholders together. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of various synchronous and asynchronous communication methods through collaborative online tools offers opportunities for more dispersed and more diverse PD research teams, settings and processes. This raises new possibilities for bridging global distances and bringing various stakeholders together for the purposes of conducting multicultural, multi-site PD. Importantly, while there exists extensive research literatures both on PD, on remote ethnography and on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, we posit that these literatures have not been brought together; nor have the practices and methodologies of these communities been sufficiently jointly explored to support the goals of multisite, multicultural PD. In this workshop, we strive to bridge this gap in knowledge through exploring the opportunities of conducting hybrid multi-site Participatory Design (HMPD) research through synchronous and asynchronous present–telepresent participatory methods, and to share issues, challenges, opportunities, methods and empirical examples pertaining to this as a goal.},

Then the principle of ship optimization is summarized, and on this basis, the function and framework of ship intelligent optimization are summarized. The key technologies in the process of intelligent optimization are contributed: 1) Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines(NURBS) surface generation technology, including parametric modeling technology and non-parametric modeling technology; 2) surrogate model technology, including artificial neural network(ANN), machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL); 3) optimization algorithm, including genetic algorithm(GA), ant colony algorithm(ACA) and artificial bee colony algorithm(ABC). Finally, the difficulties and challenges of the key technologies are analyzed. Based on artificial intelligence technology, hull form optimization can effectively improve its efficiency and provide key technical support for ship intelligent optimization.},

abstract = {With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainable work, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.},

African researchers and practitioners are discussing the power of AI in assisting governments to address community challenges. Thus, several training and workshops are conducted in Africa to build the capacity in AI and ML. Despite the training initiatives in Africa, there is little or no research regarding the implementation of these technologies in the context, which focuses on how to overcome challenges related to technology. This paper bridges the gap by exploring the current status of AI implementation in Africa. We used an online questionnaire to examine AI initiatives in Africa governments, encountered challenges and possible solutions to address the problems. MAXQDA software was used to analyze raw data. We used findings from the ongoing empirical work to propose preliminary recommendations for successful AI/ML implementation to African governments.},

abstract = {In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners as participants in co-designing the protocol for the world’s largest Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) project with children. Participatory Design – whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognised in design – can be very challenging, especially when involving children. The current COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups. Recent key barriers include social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional health risks to vulnerable children and their families. This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers). However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities. We invite the CCI community to examine Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19. Together, we offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities. This workshop builds on work conducted in a similar workshop in IDC 2020, and this year will focus on the planning and design of the protocol for the world’s largest DPD project with children.},

Framing the problem as a ‘wicked’ one, this study tackles the issue of transparency in the EnerCoach energy accounting tool through presenting a situated ethnography of the algorithmic system and exploring the issues and challenges of model transparency and post-hoc explainability therein. By engaging stakeholders through participatory design methodologies, both a conceptual understanding of the problem and material solutions thereof are developed and evaluated. The findings show the promising potential of participatory design methodologies to elevate users to a ‘critical audience’, and the solutions co-created by the study participants for the challenge of algorithmic transparency. The results also highlight the complexity of the problem: transparency of algorithmic systems must be understood as a multi-facetted and highly contextual, ‘wicked’ problem that requires diverse methodological interventions to reach ‘satisficing’ solutions.},

This results in a new sense of responsibility, but the closing of CPSR, the Computing Professionals for Social Responsibility, has left a gap. Today, across tech workers, academics and computing professionals, there is a renewed sense of urgency for engaging the public and politics to change course in how computing shapes society. What should a CPSR for the 21st century look like?

One solution is to engage young users in Participatory Design of dialogue, pushing power away from the researcher and toward the young users. This positions users as technology creators who understand AI language as a technosocial phenomenon and who have their own perspective about how identity is best portrayed in AI language.

Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.},

Nonetheless, some less privileged participants can face more barriers to participation than others, e.g., being unable to exercise their voice. The literature lacks a unified source that guides PD researchers and practitioners in devising and implementing projects with groups facing more barriers to participation. This paper addresses this gap and advances the field in two ways. First, by presenting an assessment of the current state of the art through a review of 46 participatory projects that involved less privileged participants, it identifies the diversity of participants involved in these projects, and the methods and the stage of their involvement. It also frames three conceptualizations of PD and presents common challenges researchers and participants faced during these projects. Second, based on this analysis, it presents areas for further development and discusses the implications for PD.},

Involving end users in the design of robots is vital for developing effective, useful, acceptable and user-friendly products that meet expectations, needs, and preferences. This four-year international project developed and evaluated a home-based robot for mood stabilization and cognitive improvement in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and age-related health needs. The daily-care robot was developed in collaboration with experts, carers, relatives, and older adults, through six phases. Two phases were dedicated to cognitive stimulation games. This paper provides a summary of the participatory design and mixed-methods evaluation processes undertaken to develop, refine, and test the robot. The final robot and games were acceptable to older adults, and useful for delivering stimulating activities and providing reminders for medication, health and wellbeing checks. Personalization is required to optimize human-robot interaction, and imagery and speech should be consistent with local users. Functions should be personalizable to accommodate individual health needs and preferences. This project highlights the importance of participatory design and testing robotics in end-user environments, as technical issues associated with long-term use were uncovered. Recommendations for future development and the design of assistive health robots are made.},

This workshop aimed to explore the design of new socially assistive robotic technologies that could be used to support stroke survivors in the home environment.

However, it was found that the PD’s evaluation criteria are usually set by the product team and used only at the end of a design process, without adequate user participation. To address this issue, we proposed introducing UX evaluation metrics into design materials at the participatory design INPUT phase. Using a case study of designing a chatbot for community members to report safety incidents, we studied the impact of this approach with 58 participants from two workshops. Our results showed that the integration of UX evaluation metrics efficiently rationalized participants’ contributions and helped identify key evaluation metrics when setting values for new AI systems, enhancing PD workshop insights. In addition to examining the use of the Program Theory Model to explain PD, our empirical investigation added a new dimension to this model.},

abstract = {Interfaces for machine learning (ML), information and visualizations about models or data, can help practitioners build robust and responsible ML systems. Despite their benefits, recent studies of ML teams and our interviews with practitioners (n=9) showed that ML interfaces have limited adoption in practice. While existing ML interfaces are effective for specific tasks, they are not designed to be reused, explored, and shared by multiple stakeholders in cross-functional teams. To enable analysis and communication between different ML practitioners, we designed and implemented Symphony, a framework for composing interactive ML interfaces with task-specific, data-driven components that can be used across platforms such as computational notebooks and web dashboards. We developed Symphony through participatory design sessions with 10 teams (n=31), and discuss our findings from deploying Symphony to 3 production ML projects at Apple. Symphony helped ML practitioners discover previously unknown issues like data duplicates and blind spots in models while enabling them to share insights with other stakeholders.},

To explore the method’s potential that encourages communication between AI developers and users, we conducted a case study of an AI-based coaching service. We expect AI story relay to contribute to fostering a dynamic exchange of views between developers and prospective users.},

While researchers are increasingly designing CUIs for such sensitive settings, methods and participatory design approaches to address vulnerable user groups’ highly sensitive needs and struggles are sparse in research thus far. This workshop aims to explore how we can design CUIs for and in sensitive settings with vulnerable users in mind through the participatory design process. We aim to establish a working definition of vulnerability, sensitive settings, and how practice-oriented design of CUIs can be inclusive of diverse users.},

In this paper we report on the design of an online memorial for a mass shooting that affected our university’s local community. We demonstrate an alternative approach to online memorials that blends participatory memory with participatory design through remembrance artifacts that represent ideas for gun violence prevention technologies that could have prevented the tragedy and that may prevent future tragedies. We demonstrate participatory memory + design with our memorial called the OUrchive that supports retrospective and prospective reflection on the Oxford High School shooting through designing new use cases for AI to prevent mass shootings. Early community involvement suggests that the OUrchive supports personal reconciliation with tragedy by channeling trauma towards public discourse about potential solutions to gun violence.},

abstract = {There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.},

They can also be included in work with potential and actual users, particularly in eliciting user needs and concerns. We present three case studies in which personas are part of the research with potential users of interactive systems. Blind participants in research on assistive technologies often spontaneously generated personas who would benefit more from the technology than they themselves would. This was a way of being able to discuss potential needs and concerns, without admitting to having them oneself. Older participants exploring the potential of indoor drones generated personas who were older than themselves and would need the system more. Finally, personas were created to aid discussions with forestry workers about fatigue and safety issues that they might not want to admit to having themselves. From these case studies we draw recommendations for how personas can be deployed in working with potential and actual users of interactive systems in a variety of ways.},

Interest has increased among researchers investigating the potential link between CSR activity and financial performance. In this study, we propose a method of finding CSR activities related to corporate value using random forest, a machine-learning technique. The definition of CSR is ambiguous, so we used the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26000 framework as the basic standard for investigating companies, since it is a major guideline for CSR activities in Japan. Following this framework, we used 36 CSR activities as features. Results indicated that Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) is the most important activity in corporate value classification. We then used association analysis to clarify how CSR activities related to corporate value influence. Results indicated that documentation of CSR policy is often performed in parallel with other activities, whereas, stakeholder engagement is not.},

Despite their success in research, healthcare, or education, LLMs frequently include incorrect information, called hallucinations, in their responses. These hallucinations could influence users to trust fake news or change their general beliefs. Therefore, we investigate mitigation strategies desired by users to enable identification of LLM hallucinations. To achieve this goal, we conduct a participatory design study where everyday users design interface features which are then assessed for their feasibility by machine learning (ML) experts. We find that many of the desired features are well-perceived by ML experts but are also considered as difficult to implement. Finally, we provide a list of desired features that should serve as a basis for mitigating the effect of LLM hallucinations on users.},

Because of this complexity, governing technology and data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability has proven to be a difficult task that –according to experts– requires a systems perspective in its design and implementation. In this paper, we take a conceptual approach to respond to this call from experts by providing working definitions of both enterprise data governance and a systems approach to management. Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential trade-offs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government. Simulation experiments suggest that an emphasis on governance of IT may create a strong foundation for the development of AI capability.},

With the use of a participatory game design approach, we developed an immersive, meaningful virtual training environment to improve situational awareness skills. Feedback of game developers as well as from test groups shows that the participatory approach to game development lead to a meaningful experience within an authentic virtual training environment.

abstract = {Machine intelligence relies on Al (artificial intelligence) trainers, workers who perform labor such as data annotation and algorithm optimization. However, the promise of Al does not often benefit workers equally; instead, it puts them in precarious situations, such as low wages and subordination to machines. My dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to draw attention to these pressing issues by exploring the sociotechnical, cultural, and economic dimensions of this emergent technology-mediated labor in the context of large data infrastructures. My arguments and proposed concepts (e.g., sociotechnical/algorithmic mobility) respond directly to the under-theorization of mobility research and ecologically unequal exchange theory in HCI. In my dissertation, I argue that the Al trainers, who often work in developing regions of western China, are shouldering the burdens of (1) alleviating China’s poverty through Al for development programs, (2) sustaining Eastern China’s platform economy as key participants in large-scale data infrastructure projects, and (3) promoting global Al advancement by providing disembodied labor on products such as high-quality training datasets through repetitive and low-paying work. Using multi-sited ethnography and participatory design methods, my dissertation describes the experiences of under-resourced and under-studied Al trainer communities and the effects of AI on them. It will also offer context-sensitive design recommendations for supporting emergent technology-mediated labor and policy interventions for ethical and sustainable Al training practices.},

Besides explanations, Interactive Machine Learning (IML) seeks to leverage user feedback to iterate on an ML solution to correct errors and align decisions with those of the users. Despite the rise in explainable AI (XAI) and Interactive Machine Learning (IML) research, the links between interactivity, explanations, and trust have not been comprehensively studied in the machine learning literature. Thus, in this study, we develop and evaluate an explanation-driven interactive machine learning (XIML) system with the Tic-Tac-Toe game as a use case to understand how a XIML mechanism improves users’ satisfaction with the machine learning system. We explore different modalities to support user feedback through visual or rules-based corrections. Our online user study (n = 199) supports the hypothesis that allowing interactivity within this XIML system causes participants to be more satisfied with the system, while visual explanations play a less prominent (and somewhat unexpected) role. Finally, we leverage a user-centric evaluation framework to create a comprehensive structural model to clarify how subjective system aspects, which represent participants’ perceptions of the implemented interaction and visualization mechanisms, mediate the influence of these mechanisms on the system’s user experience.},

abstract = {Health care systems are the infrastructures that are put together to deliver health and social services to the population at large. These organizations are increasingly applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care. Unfortunately, both health care systems and AI are confronted with a lack of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). This short paper focuses on the importance of integrating EDI concepts throughout the life cycle of AI in health. We discuss the risks that the lack of EDI in the design, development and implementation of AI-based tools might have on the already marginalized communities and populations in the healthcare setting. Moreover, we argue that integrating EDI principles and practice throughout the lifecycle of AI in health has an important role in achieving health equity for all populations. Further research needs to be conducted to explore how studies in AI-health have integrated.},

Typically unpredictable and opaque, it may produce unforeseen outcomes detrimental to particular groups or individuals, yet simultaneously promise amazing breakthroughs in areas as diverse as medical diagnosis and universal translation. This results in a polarized view of ML, which is often manifested through a technology-as-monster metaphor. In this paper, we acknowledge the power and potential of this metaphor by resurfacing historic complexities in human-monster relations. We (re)introduce these liminal and ambiguous creatures, and discuss their relation to ML. We offer a background to designers' use of metaphor, and show how the technology-as-monster metaphor can generatively probe and (re)frame the questions ML poses. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed discussion of an early-stage generative design workshop inquiring into ML approaches to supporting student mental health and well-being.},

The premise of the project was to design a service that could enhance the experience of reminiscing about a dear departed. This service was meant to come into play once the user had completed the mourning process and accepted the loss. Despite conducting User Interviews and Brainstorming intently upon design ideas, the outcome of ideation seemed to lack the appropriate mood and sensitivity that would suit someone who reminisces upon a dear departed. The authors then approached PD to gain a deeper understanding of user needs, sensibilities and better sensitivity towards the tone of the design while dealing with a delicate subject like fond reminiscence of a dear one who has passed on.},

They also often ascribe social meaning to the robot's pragmatic behaviors. Based on these findings, we propose four considerations for future HRCD systems: managing the shared workspace, communicating preferences about design goals, respecting different design styles, and taking into account the social meaning of design acts.},

We derive five interference conditions for such art-based ML prototypes—situational whole, small data, shallow model, learnable algorithm, and somaesthetic behaviour—and describe their widening of design and engineering practices of ML prototyping. Finally, we sketch how a process of intra-active machine learning could complement that of interactive machine learning to take materiality as an entry point for ML design within HCI.},

It examines three existing kinds of participation in design practice and machine learning participation as work, participation as consultation, and as participation as justice – to argue that the machine learning community must become attuned to possibly exploitative and extractive forms of community involvement and shift away from the prerogatives of context independent scalability. Cautioning against “participation washing”, it argues that the notion of “participation” should be expanded to acknowledge more subtle, and possibly exploitative, forms of community involvement in participatory machine learning design. Specifically, it suggests that it is imperative to recognize design participation as work; to ensure that participation as consultation is context-specific; and that participation as justice must be genuine and long term. The paper argues that such a development can only be scaffolded by a new epistemology around design harms, including, but not limited to, in machine learning. To facilitate such a development, the paper suggests developing we argue that developing a cross-sectoral database of design participation failures that is cross-referenced with socio-structural dimensions and highlights “edge cases” that can and must be learned from.},

This area of work, dubbed Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML), re-thinks ML research and systems in terms of human goals. HCML gathers an interdisciplinary group of HCI and ML practitioners, each bringing their unique, yet related perspectives.

We found that while there are manifold technical approaches, these often focus on ML experts and are evaluated in decontextualized empirical studies. We hypothesized that participatory design research may support the understanding of stakeholders' situated sense-making in our project, yet, found guidance regarding ML interpretability inexhaustive. Building on philosophy of technology, we formulated explanation strategies as an empirical-analytical lens explicating how technical explanations mediate the contextual preferences concerning people's interpretations. In this paper, we contribute a report of our proof-of-concept use of explanation strategies to analyze a co-design workshop with non-ML experts, methodological implications for participatory design research, design implications for explanations for non-ML experts and suggest further investigation of technological mediation theories in the ML interpretability space.},

The proposed DI is distinct from tutors, chatbots, recommenders and other similar systems since they seek to diverge from a solution (rather than converge towards one) by encouraging consideration of other possibilities. We develop a conceptual design of the system, then present examples from deep Convolution Neural Networks[1,7] learning models. The first example shows results from a model that was trained on an open-source dataset (publicly available online) of a community technical support chat transcripts, while the second one was trained on a design-focused dataset obtained from transcripts of experts engaged in engineering design problem solving (unavailable publicly). Based on the results from these models, we propose the necessary improvements on models and training datasets that must be resolved in order to achieve usable and reliable collaborative text/voice systems that fall in this class of AI systems.},

It does so by presenting a case study of a series of speculative design workshops, conducted in 2021. These workshops drew on intersectional feminist methodologies to construct interdisciplinary interventions in the design of machine learning systems, towards more inclusive, accountable, and contextualized systems design. The concepts of “situating/situated knowledges”, "figuration", "diffraction", and “critical fabulation/speculation” were taken up as theoretical and methodological tools for concept-led design workshops. This paper presents the design framework of the workshops and highlights tensions and possibilities with regards to interdisciplinary machine learning systems design towards more inclusive, contextualized, and accountable systems. It discusses the role that critical theoretical concepts can play in a design process and shows how such concepts can work as methodological tools that nonetheless require an open-ended experimental space to function. It presents insights and discussion points regarding what it means to work with critical intersectional knowledge that is inextricably connected to its historical and socio-political roots, and how this reframes what it might mean to design fair and accountable systems.},

Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance.

abstract = {Secondary school physical education (PE) teachers are continuously challenged to find ways to support students learning and motivate them for an active and healthy lifestyle. To address this complexity, continuing teacher professional development (TPD) is key. Technological tools can facilitate the effective delivery of TPD in this context. Successful implementation of this technology, however, is not self-evident. Based on the general aim of effectively integrating technologies in the educational process and focusing on the needs of educators, this study examines how the evidence-based theoretical TARGET framework for creating a motivating PE learning climate might be embedded into a digital professional development tool for PE teachers, useful in everyday practice. It presents a case study in which a multidisciplinary team of researchers, designers, and end-users iteratively went through several phases of need identification, idea generation, designing, development, and testing. By using a participatory approach, we were able to collect contextualized data and gain insights into users’ preferences, requirements, and ideas for designing and engaging with the tool. Based on these insights the TPD TARGET-tool for PE teachers was ultimately developed. The most prominent characteristics of this tool are (1) the combination of an evaluative function with teaching strategy support, (2) the strong emphasis on ease of use due to the complex PE teaching context, (3) the avoidance of social comparison, and suggestions of normative judgment, and (4) the allowance for a high level of customization and teacher autonomy.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) applications are now increasingly pervasive and powerful. However, fashion designers are lagging behind in leveraging this increasingly common technology. DNNs are not yet a standard part of fashion de sign practice, either clothes patterns or prototyping tools. In this paper, we present DeepWear, a method using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for clothes design. The DNNs learn the feature of specific brand clothes and generate images then patterns instructed from the images are made, and an author creates clothes based on that. We evaluated this system by evaluating the credibility of the actual sold clothes on market with our clothes. As the result, we found it is possible to make clothes look like actual products from the generated images. Our findings have implications for collaborative design between machine and human intelligence.},

The objective of this method set up in educational environment with pupils aged 9-11 years old was to design devices supporting creativity in narrative activities. The DIMI method consists of four stages: Discover - Invent - Mix - Iterate, and integrates the child as a socio-culturally situated subject. This anthropocentric method is based on an analysis of children activity structured with their schemes in order design devices that make sense for the subject and that allow him to transform them into instruments while transforming himself. The reference situation that we analyze here with the instrumental approach (Rabardel, 1995) focuses on the creation of a collective tale.},

abstract = {Although sharing multimedia content on online social networks (OSNs) has many benefits, publishing photos or videos of other people—without obtaining permission—can cause multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs). Early studies developed technical solutions and dissuasive approaches to address MPCs. However, none of these studies involved, in the design process, the OSN users who have experienced MPCs. Hence, they possibly overlooked the valuable experiences these individuals have accrued. To fill this gap, we recruited participants specifically from this population of users, and we involved them in participatory design sessions to find solutions to reduce the incidence of MPCs. To frame the activities of our participants, we borrowed terminology and concepts from a well-known framework used in the justice systems. Over the course of several design sessions, our participants designed 10 solutions to mitigate MPCs. The designed solutions are based on different mechanisms, including preventing MPCs from occurring, dissuading users from sharing, resolving the conflicts, and educating users about community standards. We discuss the open design and research opportunities suggested by the designed solutions and contribute an ideal workflow that synthesizes the best of each solution. We contribute to the innovation of privacy-enhancing technologies to limit the incidence of MPCs in OSNs.},

abstract = {The paramount measure of success for a machine learning model has historically been predictive power and accuracy, but even a gold-standard accuracy benchmark fails when it inappropriately misrepresents a disabled or minority body. In this work, we reframe the role of machine learning as a provocation through a case study of participatory work co-creating exergames by employing machine learning and its training as a source of play and motivation rather than an accurate diagnostic tool for children with and without Sensory Based Motor Disorder. We created a design probe, Cirkus, that supports nearly any aminal locomotion exergame while collecting movement data for training a bespoke machine learning model. During 5 participatory workshops with a total of 30 children using Cirkus, we co-created a catalog of 17 exergames and a resulting machine-learning model. We discuss the potential implications of reframing machine learning’s role in Assistive Technology for values other than accuracy, share the challenges of using “messy” movement data from children with disabilities in an ever-changing co-creation context for training machine learning, and present broader implications of using machine learning in therapy games.},

abstract = {Building service robots-robots that perform various services in buildings-are becoming more common in large buildings such as hotels and stores. We aim to leverage such robots to serve as guides for blind people. In this paper, we sought to design specifications that detail how a building service robot could interact with and guide a blind person through a building in an effective and socially acceptable way. We conducted participatory design sessions with three designers and five non-designers. Two of the designers and all of the non-designers had a vision disability. Primary features of the design include allowing the user to (1) summon the robot after entering the building, (2) choose from three modes of assistance (Sighted Guide, Escort, and Information Kiosk), and (3) receive information about the building's layout from the robot. We conclude with a discussion of themes and a reflection about our design process that can benefit robot design for blind people in general.},

abstract = {Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams.},

abstract = {Developing the problem solving skills of children is a challenging problem that is crucial for the future of our society. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {Practitioners from diverse occupations and backgrounds are increasingly using machine learning (ML) methods. Nonetheless, studies on ML Practitioners typically draw populations from Big Tech and academia, as researchers have easier access to these communities. Through this selection bias, past research often excludes the broader, lesser-resourced ML community---for example, practitioners working at startups, at non-tech companies, and in the public sector. These practitioners share many of the same ML development difficulties and ethical conundrums as their Big Tech counterparts; however, their experiences are subject to additional under-studied challenges stemming from deploying ML with limited resources, increased existential risk, and absent access to in-house research teams. We contribute a qualitative analysis of 17 interviews with stakeholders from organizations which are less represented in prior studies. We uncover a number of tensions which are introduced or exacerbated by these organizations' resource constraints---tensions between privacy and ubiquity, resource management and performance optimization, and access and monopolization. Increased academic focus on these practitioners can facilitate a more holistic understanding of ML limitations, and so is useful for prescribing a research agenda to facilitate responsible ML development for all.},

There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two. Traditionally, this has been the realm of design; In this workshop, we ask what themes, questions and methods should be addressed by an emerging design-oriented urban AI research community?},

abstract = {Detrimental online behavior such as harassment and cyberbullying is becoming a serious, large-scale problem damaging people's lives. This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.},

abstract = {Thousands of offshore oil and gas structures worldwide are approaching the end of their operating lifespan. Decommissioning processes are expensive and normally take years to finish as various options need to be analysed based on numerous stakeholders’ preferences. Despite recent and significant progress in machine learning and data-driven applications in the oil and gas industry, very little work has been done in the area of using machine learning to inform the decommissioning processes and operations. This can be attributed to the lack of relevant public datasets with sufficient samples. In this paper, we present a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset comprised of 708 real samples extracted from over a hundred company proposals and reports. A supervised learning algorithm was applied to the dataset to predict the decommissioning option. Experiments and results suggest that a machine learning approach can greatly help shorten the traditional analysis process while providing decent accuracy. The classification results of this work serve as a baseline to motivate further experiments and enable the research community to broaden and advance the knowledge in this prominent and timely topic.},

abstract = {The increased use of Artificial Intelligence, and in particular Machine Learning (ML) raises the need for widespread AI literacy, in three particular areas related to ML; understanding how ML works, the process behind creating ML models, and the ability to reflect on its personal and societal implications. Existing ML learning tools focus primarily on the first two areas, and to a lesser degree the third. In order to address this, we designed VotestratesML; a tool allowing K-12 students to build models and make predictions based on real world voting data. Based on in-situ deployments of VotestratesML, we reflect on opportunities and challenges for engaging K-12 students in understanding and reflecting on ML. We find that the design of VotestratesML supports students’ engagement in all three areas of ML, through grounding ML in a known subject area and allowing for collaboration and competition.},

abstract = {Virtual humans (VHs) have the potential to support mental wellness among college computer science (CS) students. However, designing effective VHs for counseling purposes requires a clear understanding of students’ demographics, backgrounds, and expectations. To this end, we conducted two user studies with 216 CS students from a major university in North America. In the first study, we explored how students co-designed VHs to support mental wellness conversations and found that the VHs’ demographics, appearance, and voice closely resembled the characteristics of their designers. In the second study, we investigated how the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacted the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward gratitude journaling. Our findings suggest that the active participation of CS students in VH design leads to the creation of agents that closely resemble their designers. Moreover, we found that the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacts the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward mental wellness techniques.},

abstract = {As immersive technologies are increasingly being adopted by artists, dancers and developers in their creative work, there is a demand for tools and methods to design compelling ways of embodied interaction within virtual environments. Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.},

We introduce a sandbox approach with the goal of designing alternative programming interactions for machine learning tasks. A set of guidelines have been drafted and supported with user interviews to validate the proposed design framework. Ten students with novice machine learning experience participated in the study to formulate a programming pipeline that was used to draft the guidelines based on the literary review. A problem statement was formed from the analysis of interview insights using UX Research techniques. The insights suggest that a visual sandbox approach helps reduce the learning curve of programming machine learning tasks. The design guidelines we drafted focused on the three design factors namely system intent, interaction, and algorithm visualization. Considering these guidelines, a prototype was produced that will undergo future testing and validation.},

In order to let students explore how ML is embedded into our infrastructure, we designed ml-machine.org, an educational tool for creating ML models with the micro:bit, and incorporating them into interactive systems, thus making ML a design material. Through an in-situ pilot study in an 8th grade classroom we demonstrates that students were able to redesign everyday objects around the possibilities and limitations imposed by ML, but that they struggled to understand more advanced parts of ML such as data representation. Based on these experiences we discuss focus areas for future directions of the tool: Enriching machine learning as a design material; exposing machine learning design practices; addressing the difficult parts.},

However, high quality, mainstream movement interaction requires effective tools and techniques to support designers. A promising approach to movement interaction design is Interactive Machine Learning, in which designing is done by physically performing an action. This article brings together many different perspectives on understanding human movement knowledge and movement interaction. This understanding shows that the embodied knowledge involved in movement interaction is very different from the representational knowledge involved in a traditional interface, so a very different approach to design is needed. We apply this knowledge to understand why interactive machine learning is an effective tool for motion interaction designers and to make a number of suggestions for future development of the technique.},

In this work, we investigate how non-expert deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people understand ML technologies and design ML-based sound recognition systems. We conduct a workshop study consisting of an ML lecture and an interactive learning session using a sound recognition system. Through observations during the workshop and semi-structured interviews, we clarify that non-expert DHH people start to overcome the knowledge gap. They could obtain a more detailed understanding of ML technology and how to use sounds to train ML models.},

Conflicts are detected according of each engineers semantics which are defined by using OWL ontologies and SWRL rules. When they are detected, the framework allows solving them by negotiating possible alternatives. Then the alternatives are evaluated by expressing preferences and the picked alternative, being the one that maximizes the global welfare, is applied in all the models in the distributed environment.

We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI. ConsultAI is a conversational assistant that can provide real-time decision support to OH physicians during clinical interviews. Based on this case study, we discussed stakeholder engagement in the design of IDSTs for OH physicians.},

abstract = {Self-managing a chronic condition involves adapting management strategies to life’s continual change. Among these changes, moments of significant life transition can render routine self-management practices obsolete without significant modification to the new context. In this study, we examine one significant life transition for young adults living with Type 1 Diabetes, the move from home to university, to understand how near future AI-enhanced technologies might provide opportunities and challenges for supporting care. From interviews with 24 students in the UK who had moved away from their childhood homes, we used sensemaking literature to frame the process of initial disruption to the rebuilding of self-care practices around a new lifestyle and support networks. By studying a significant life transition, we uncover implications for the design of T1D technology, particularly closed-loop systems, through AI enhancements and human-centred design approaches, then extrapolate for other significant life transitions and chronic conditions.},

We introduce JIZAI ARMS, a supernumerary robotic limb system consisting of a wearable base unit with six terminals and detachable robot arms controllable by the wearer. The system was designed to enable social interaction between multiple wearers, such as an exchange of arm(s), and explore possible interactions between digital cyborgs in a cyborg society. This paper describes the JIZAI ARMS’ design process, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human augmentation researchers, product designers, a system architect, and manufacturers, to realize a technically complex system while considering the aesthetics of a digital cyborg. We also provide an autobiographical report of our first impressions of using the JIZAI ARMS and use our findings to speculate on a model of potential social interactions between digital cyborgs.},

Machine learning (ML) methods can identify patterns, but a key challenge is making actionable suggestions based on personal health data. We introduce GlucoGoalie, which combines ML with an expert system to translate ML output into personalized nutrition goal suggestions for individuals with T2D. In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants’ self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts. We discuss implications for ML-based interventions and the need for systems that offer more interactivity, feedback, and negotiation.},

Unhoused persons are vulnerable and using their data in the ML pipeline raises serious concerns about the unintended harms and consequences of prioritizing different ML values. To address this, we conducted a critical analysis of 40 research papers identified through a systematic literature review in ML homelessness service provision research. We found that the values of novelty, performance, and identifying limitations were uplifted in these papers, whereas (in)efficiency, (low/high) cost, fast, (violated) privacy, and (homeless condition) reproducibility valuescollapse. Consequently, unhoused persons were lost (i.e., humans were deprioritized) at multi-level ML abstraction of predictors, categories, and algorithms. Our findings illuminate potential pathways forward at the intersection of data science, HCI and STS by situating humans at the center to support this vulnerable community.},

We evaluate TactJam in a two-part distributed online workshop, exploring the design of on-body tactons. Participants were able to successfully use TactJam to learn about tacton design. We present an overview of mappings between tactons and their associated concepts before comparing the results of tactons created using solely a GUI and tactons created through experimenting with placements directly on the body. Conducting both parts of the workshop separately highlighted the importance of designing directly with bodies: less implicit assumptions were made, and designs were guided by personal experience. We reflect on these results and close on deliberations for the future development of TactJam.},

abstract = {Currently boundary representations (b-reps) are a convenient means to exchange solid models between applications in a distributed design environment. There are two widely used approaches that help maintain the consistency of b-reps between applications, e.g., when a b-rep is modified in one application and needs to be updated in the other. One approach involves using a common database of b-reps where consistency is automatically guaranteed. The other approach involves using a repeated transfer of the entire b-rep using ftp-like protocols. The former results in a system that is not truly distributed and the later results in consuming large amounts of network bandwidth and unacceptable latencies. This paper seeks to alleviate the abovementioned disadvantages by introducing a scheme for the incremental exchange of b-reps (i.e., for incrementally updating a pre-edit model to be consistent with the post-edit model) between applications in a collaborative design environment. Note that this work does not focus on techniques that maintain or verify the validity of post-edit models. It is assumed that all edits performed are valid.The essential components of this paper include algorithms to (a) dynamically decompose the pre- and post-edit b-reps into volumetric regions, (b) identify and extract those regions in the post-edit model that have been modified, and (c) dynamically transmit and embed modified regions into a pre-edit b-rep at another site. The domain of objects is restricted to specialized non-manifold objects with manifold volumetric regions. The abovementioned algorithms are based on a cellular model that tracks decomposed regions in a b-rep. Non-regularized Boolean operations are used to introduce decompositions in the cellular model. The conditions for detecting changes in regions are studied. Finally, specialized extracting and embedding operations are defined on cellular models for extracting modified cells from post-edit models and embedding modified cells into the pre-edit models.},

Findings indicate that participants want social matching apps to augment women's abilities for self-protection, reflected in three new app roles: 1) the cloaking device, through which the social matching app helps women dynamically manage visibility to geographically nearby users, 2) the informant, through which the app helps women predict risk of harm associated with a recommended social opportunity, and 3) the guardian, through which the app monitors a user's safety during face-to-face meetings and augments their response to risk.},

abstract = {Unintended biases in machine learning (ML) models have the potential to introduce undue discrimination and exacerbate social inequalities. The research community has proposed various technical and qualitative methods intended to assist practitioners in assessing these biases. While frameworks for identifying the risks of harm due to unintended biases have been proposed, they have not yet been operationalised into practical tools to assist industry practitioners.In this paper, we link prior work on bias assessment methods to phases of a standard organisational risk management process (RMP), noting a gap in measures for helping practitioners identify bias- related risks. Targeting this gap, we introduce a bias identification methodology and questionnaire, illustrating its application through a real-world, practitioner-led use case. We validate the need and usefulness of the questionnaire through a survey of industry practitioners, which provides insights into their practical requirements and preferences. Our results indicate that such a questionnaire is helpful for proactively uncovering unexpected bias concerns, particularly where it is easy to integrate into existing processes, and facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders. Ultimately, the effective end-to-end management of ML risks requires a more targeted identification of potential harm and its sources, so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be formulated. Towards this, our questionnaire provides a practical means to assist practitioners in identifying bias-related risks.},

Social media can be a useful outlet for social participation for individuals with TBI, but there are barriers to access. While research has drawn attention to the nature of access barriers, few studies have investigated technological solutions to address these barriers, particularly considering the perspectives of individuals with TBI. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a participatory approach to engage 10 adults with TBI in conceptualizing tools to address their challenges accessing Facebook. Participants described multifaceted challenges in using social media, including interface overload, social comparisons, and anxiety over self-presentation and communication after injury. They discussed their needs and preferences and generated ideas for design solutions. Our work contributes to designing assistive and accessibility technology to facilitate an equal access to the benefits of social media for individuals with TBI.},

abstract = {In conventional software development, user experience (UX) designers and engineers collaborate through separation of concerns (SoC): designers create human interface specifications, and engineers build to those specifications. However, we argue that Human-AI systems thwart SoC because human needs must shape the design of the AI interface, the underlying AI sub-components, and training data. How do designers and engineers currently collaborate on AI and UX design? To find out, we interviewed 21 industry professionals (UX researchers, AI engineers, data scientists, and managers) across 14 organizations about their collaborative work practices and associated challenges. We find that hidden information encapsulated by SoC challenges collaboration across design and engineering concerns. Practitioners describe inventing ad-hoc representations exposing low-level design and implementation details (which we characterize as leaky abstractions) to “puncture” SoC and share information across expertise boundaries. We identify how leaky abstractions are employed to collaborate at the AI-UX boundary and formalize a process of creating and using leaky abstractions.},

To work around this, ML teams will extrapolate proxy signals, or alternative signs from data to evaluate illness status and create training datasets. However, these signals' validity has not been determined, whether signals align with important contextual factors, and how proxy quality impacts downstream model integrity. We use ML and qualitative methods to evaluate whether a popular proxy signal, diagnostic self-disclosure, produces a conceptually sound ML model of mental illness. Our findings identify major conceptual errors only seen through a qualitative investigation -- training data built from diagnostic disclosures encodes a narrow vision of diagnosis experiences that propagates into paradoxes in the downstream ML model. This gap is obscured by strong performance of the ML classifier (F1 = 0.91). We discuss the implications of conceptual gaps in creating training data for human-centered models, and make suggestions for improving research methods.},

abstract = {To ensure accountability and mitigate harm, it is critical that diverse stakeholders can interrogate black-box automated systems and find information that is understandable, relevant, and useful to them. In this paper, we eschew prior expertise- and role-based categorizations of interpretability stakeholders in favor of a more granular framework that decouples stakeholders’ knowledge from their interpretability needs. We characterize stakeholders by their formal, instrumental, and personal knowledge and how it manifests in the contexts of machine learning, the data domain, and the general milieu. We additionally distill a hierarchical typology of stakeholder needs that distinguishes higher-level domain goals from lower-level interpretability tasks. In assessing the descriptive, evaluative, and generative powers of our framework, we find our more nuanced treatment of stakeholders reveals gaps and opportunities in the interpretability literature, adds precision to the design and comparison of user studies, and facilitates a more reflexive approach to conducting this research.},

abstract = {Engaging end user groups with machine learning (ML) models can help align the design of predictive systems with people's needs and expectations. We present a co-design study investigating the benefits and challenges of using computational notebooks to inform ML models with end user groups. We used a computational notebook to engage young adults, carers, and clinicians with an example ML model that predicted health risk in diabetes care. Through co-design workshops and retrospective interviews, we found that participants particularly valued using the interactive data visualisations of the computational notebook to scaffold multidisciplinary learning, anticipate benefits and harms of the example ML model, and create fictional feature importance plots to highlight care needs. Participants also reported challenges, from running code cells to managing information asymmetries and power imbalances. We discuss the potential of leveraging computational notebooks as interactive co-design tools to meet end user needs early in ML model lifecycles.},

abstract = {Research in artificial intelligence (AI) for social good presupposes some definition of social good, but potential definitions have been seldom suggested and never agreed upon. The normative question of what AI for social good research should be "for" is not thoughtfully elaborated, or is frequently addressed with a utilitarian outlook that prioritizes the needs of the majority over those who have been historically marginalized, brushing aside realities of injustice and inequity. We argue that AI for social good ought to be assessed by the communities that the AI system will impact, using as a guide the capabilities approach, a framework to measure the ability of different policies to improve human welfare equity. Furthermore, we lay out how AI research has the potential to catalyze social progress by expanding and equalizing capabilities. We show how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for the design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework we introduce called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project. We conclude by providing an incomplete set of guiding questions for carrying out such participatory AI research in a way that elicits and respects a community's own definition of social good.},

abstract = {For economic reasons, manufacturers have been considering dedicating commercial flights to a single pilot for the last ten years. In order to ensure a certain redundancy, this pilot could be assisted by a ground pilot. In the absence of appropriate collaboration tools, the physical separation of these pilots will lead to a degradation of the mutual understanding of behaviors (observable fact on a person) and activities (i.e. mutual awareness). In order to restore mutual awareness, indicators of each pilot’s behavior (i.e. design element) need to be integrated into future flight tools. In this paper, we study the modalities of design elements in two new interfaces (ground and onboard) developed by iterations. These collaborative interfaces contain two types of elements: a remote display of the pilot’s eye movements, via an eye-tracking system, and an indicator of the activities performed in the tool (moving in the map, navigation in the tabs). Two remote collaboration scenarios were proposed to four professional pilots. They allowed to identify the cues to be transmitted, such as the availability of the pilots, and to test the transmission modalities: capture (eye-tracking, audio, interface inputs), temporality (continuous transmission) and representation (graphic, audio).},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in our everyday technologies and impacts both individuals and communities. The explainable AI (XAI) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. In addition, existing XAI research tends to focus on the individual level. Little is known about how people understand and explain AI-led decisions in the community context. Drawing from XAI and activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-AI interaction. We then present a case study of AI-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of AI-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of CSCW, HCI, and XAI.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains comes with both high expectations of its benefits and dire predictions of misuse. While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

abstract = {Algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 5 years since its deployment.},

As these explanation strategies mature, practitioners will gain experience that helps them know which strategies to deploy in different circumstances.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are quickly becoming pervasive in ways that impact the lives of all humans across the globe. In an effort to make otherwise ”black box” AI/ML systems more understandable, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has arisen with the goal of developing algorithms, toolkits, frameworks, and other techniques that enable people to comprehend, trust, and manage AI systems. However, although XAI is a rapidly growing area of research, most of the work has focused on contexts in the Global North, and little is known about if or how XAI techniques have been designed, deployed, or tested with communities in the Global South. This gap is concerning, especially in light of rapidly growing enthusiasm from governments, companies, and academics to use AI/ML to “solve” problems in the Global South. Our paper contributes the first systematic review of XAI research in the Global South, providing an early look at emerging work in the space. We identified 16 papers from 15 different venues that targeted a wide range of application domains. All of the papers were published in the last three years. Of the 16 papers, 13 focused on applying a technical XAI method, all of which involved the use of (at least some) data that was local to the context. However, only three papers engaged with or involved humans in the work, and only one attempted to deploy their XAI system with target users. We close by reflecting on the current state of XAI research in the Global South, discussing data and model considerations for building and deploying XAI systems in these regions, and highlighting the need for human-centered approaches to XAI in the Global South.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly prevalent in our communities, aligning the values motivating their behavior with human values is critical. However, it is often difficult or impossible for humans, both expert and non-expert, to enumerate values comprehensively, accurately, and in forms that are readily usable for robot planning. Misspecification can lead to undesired, inefficient, or even dangerous behavior. In the value alignment problem, humans and robots work together to optimize human objectives, which are often represented as reward functions and which the robot can infer by observing human actions. In existing alignment approaches, no explicit feedback about this inference process is provided to the human. In this paper, we introduce an exploratory framework to address this problem, which we call Transparent Value Alignment (TVA). TVA suggests that techniques from explainable AI (XAI) be explicitly applied to provide humans with information about the robot's beliefs throughout learning, enabling efficient and effective human feedback.},

abstract = {Since 2014, a growing body of critical research has pointed out flaws in smart city development. It has been described as too technology-led and business-oriented, diminishing citizens' agency and causing digital divides. As the agenda keeps spreading, there is an urgent need to develop more participatory, inclusive and bottom-up approaches to balance interests of those currently in strong power positions, such as large corporations. Participatory design (PD) and participatory approaches in general have been suggested as a remedy, but they often tend to be local, small-scale and short-term. Therefore, their impacts are often modest as well. We suggest that we need to start thinking about ways to create scalable approaches that would grow the temporal and spatial impact of actions and practices that intend to increase citizens' understanding and control over new technologies, i.e. their technological agency. Without making sure that more people have adequate knowledge and sufficient control and mastery of technologies, societal discussion and ultimately, political decisions, are left to few experts. We explore the potential of public libraries to act as an ally and cooperation partner in participatory design and technology education in general, with a significant potential to broaden micro-level actions' impact.The paper consists of a broad literature review mapping the central challenges of current smart city development; this is followed with an introduction to the Finnish library system as a democratic project; finally, we present three examples of how libraries are carrying out technological education connected to emerging technologies, particularly to 3D printing, robotics and virtual reality. Our central argument is that there is a need to bridge micro-level actions, such as those connected to participatory design projects, with the macro-level technopolitical development by collaborating with meso-level actors and networks.},

We describe the challenges, solutions reached and lessons learned whilst employing a participatory design (PD) approach in the development of a prototype computer therapy tool for people with aphasia, a communication disorder.Our approach was workshop based. During a series of participatory workshop sessions, five people with aphasia, employed as consultants, took part in game-playing activities followed by hands-on interaction with a series of iterative prototypes. The challenges we faced arose primarily from the consultants' difficulties with the production and comprehension of language, both textual and verbal, and with the retention of information. The strategies and techniques we devised to cope with these challenges evolved over the course of the workshop sessions. We discuss these and how to involve and empower users with cognitive impairments, in the context of a broadening scope of PD practices.},

In the following we present a framework of design decisions inferred from ML situations that occurred between end-users and stakeholders in two participatory design workshops. The participants of the workshops were tasked with redesigning the graphical user interface (GUI) of an electronic ambulance record (EAR). Users participated primarily in the first workshop while stakeholders as well as users participated in the second. We identify the concepts of actionable and volatile ML situations that may result in solidification of a decision of either the design of the artefact or the development process. These concepts are applied post-hoc to four exemplary ML situations that occurred during the workshops: a) a ML situation where design issues of ease of use were solved by users; b) a situation where usability issues beyond the users' grasp were identified in the first workshop and solved by stakeholders and users together during the second workshop; c) and d) situations where usability issues were solved by the users in the first workshop but not discussed with stakeholders despite the fact that the users had proclaimed that the redesign could have consequences for the stakeholders in the long run. By applying the framework to the ML situations as we define situation "a" and "b" as actionable and situation "c" and "d" as volatile.},

Yet, the discourse around AI has long been by experts and for experts. In this paper, we argue for a participatory approach towards designing human-AI interactions. We outline how we used design methodology to organise an interdisciplinary workshop with a diverse group of students – a workbook sprint with 45 participants from four different programs and 13 countries – to develop speculative design futures in five focus areas. We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach. We then conclude by laying out how others might use our findings and initiate their own workbook sprint to explore complex technologies in a human-centred way.},

We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children.

Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.},

This paper addresses both of these directions, questioning how a renewed political agenda of PD intersects the processes of institutioning in which PD itself takes part. To do that, we refer to an European-funded project called Commonfare, aimed at designing a digital platform fostering the emergence of a new economic model in the domain of the institutions of the welfare state. We conclude by discussing how a PD political agenda based on the critique of the current forms of capitalism aligns with or challenges existing institutional frames, supporting the emergence of new institutions.},

abstract = {The adoption of design fiction into design research has recently been expanding within the HCI community. Design fiction workshops have fruitfully facilitated users and researchers discussing and creating future technologies by exposing differing viewpoints. Yet, most scholarship focuses on the ostensibly successful outputs of these workshops. It remains unclear exactly what sort of interaction dynamics are instigated by design fiction in collaborative design. How might design fiction affect what we consider in design, and how is this reflected in the ensuing design? To fill this gap, our study examines design fictions across five workshops where diverse participants created futuristic autobiographies, a method to elicit values, and built diegetic prototypes both individually and collaboratively. We detail their design processes and unpack three kinds of soft conflicts that arose between participants and allowed them to bring up and discuss differing values regarding technology in society. Reflecting on our workshops, we discuss their implications on how one might employ design fiction in collaborative design.},

It is uniquely difficult to introduce clinician-facing ML-based systems in practice, which has been recognised in HCI and related fields. Recent publications have begun to address the sociotechnical challenges of designing, developing, and successfully deploying clinician-facing ML-based systems. We conducted a qualitative systematic review and provided answers to the question: “How can HCI researchers and practitioners contribute to the successful realisation of ML in medical practice?” We reviewed 25 eligible papers that investigated the real-world clinical implications of concrete clinician-facing ML-based systems. The main contributions of this systematic review are: (1) an overview of the technical aspects of ML innovation and their consequences for HCI researchers and practitioners; (2) a description of the different roles that ML-based systems can take in clinical settings; (3) a conceptualisation of the main activities of medical ML innovation processes; (4) identification of five sociotechnical interdependencies that emerge from medical ML innovation; and (5) implications for HCI researchers and practitioners on how to mitigate the sociotechnical challenges of medical ML innovation.},

ADMINS explores the potential of a conversational user interface (CUI) to reduce administrative burden and improve outcomes, by replacing static forms with written and spoken dialogue. Students with accessibility needs often face excessive administrative burden. A CUI could be beneficial in this context if designed to be fully accessible. At the same time, we recognise the broader potential of CUIs for these types of processes, and the project aims to understand the multiple opportunities and challenges, using participatory design, iterative development and trials evaluations.},

abstract = {What does it mean for a generative AI model to be explainable? The emergent discipline of explainable AI (XAI) has made great strides in helping people understand discriminative models. Less attention has been paid to generative models that produce artifacts, rather than decisions, as output. Meanwhile, generative AI (GenAI) technologies are maturing and being applied to application domains such as software engineering. Using scenario-based design and question-driven XAI design approaches, we explore users’ explainability needs for GenAI in three software engineering use cases: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. We conducted 9 workshops with 43 software engineers in which real examples from state-of-the-art generative AI models were used to elicit users’ explainability needs. Drawing from prior work, we also propose 4 types of XAI features for GenAI for code and gathered additional design ideas from participants. Our work explores explainability needs for GenAI for code and demonstrates how human-centered approaches can drive the technical development of XAI in novel domains.},

abstract = {The emergence of sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning tools poses a challenge to archives and records professionals, who are accustomed to understanding and documenting the activities of human agents rather than the often-opaque processes of sophisticated AI functioning. Preliminary work has proposed the term ‘paradata’ to describe the unique documentation needs which emerge for archivists using AI tools to process records in their collections. For the purposes of archivists working with AI, paradata is here conceptualized as information recorded and preserved about records’ processing with AI tools; it is a category of data which is defined both by its relationship with other datasets and by the documentary purpose which it serves. This paper surveys relevant literatures across three contexts to scope the relevant scholarship which archivists may draw upon to develop appropriate AI documentation practices. From the statistical social sciences and the visual heritage fields, the paper discusses existing definitions of paradata and its ambiguous, often contextually dependent relationship with existing metadata categories. Approaching the problem from a sociotechnical perspective, literature on explainable AI insists pointedly that explainability be attuned to specific users’ stated needs – needs which archivists may better articulate using the framework of paradata. Most importantly, the paper situates AI as a challenge to accountability, transparency, and impartiality in archives by introducing an unfamiliar nonhuman agency, one which pushes the limits of existing archival practice and demands the development of new concepts and vocabularies to shape future technological and methodological developments in archives.},

abstract = {In recent years both companies and research communities call for collaborative work practices and user-centered approaches in various design fields. There are several challenges and issues to take into consideration. For instance there is a need to find ways of collaborating across various competences, interests, responsibilities and perhaps professional languages both within one organization, between several organizations and between the organizations and a group of (potential) users. It is necessary to find ways to learn about users and the contexts of use, and to create a common understanding of the development task. This paper presents a set of four design games, which offers solutions to the challenges mentioned. The design games have been developed in the Space Studio during several projects and years. Here experiences are discussed on the basis of two research projects carried out in collaboration with industrial partners and potential users, and use of the games in three educational settings.The overall aim of the design games is to help facilitate a user-centered design process for cross-disciplinary design groups early in the design process. Framing collaborative design activities in a game format, arguably improves idea generation and communication between stakeholders. By shifting focus to the game, power relations and other factors that might hamper idea generation, are downplayed.},

abstract = {Current augmentative communication technology has had limited success conveying the needs of some individuals with minimally verbal autism spectrum disorder (mvASD). Primary caregivers report being able to better understand these individuals' non-traditional utterances than those less familiar with the individual such as teachers and community members. We present an eight-month multi-phase case study for a translational platform, ECHOS, that uses primary caregivers' unique knowledge to enhance communicative and affective exchanges between mvASD individuals and the broader community. Through iterative development and participatory design, we discovered that physiological sensors were impractical for long-term use, on-body audio was content rich and easily accessible, and a custom in-the-moment labeling app was transformative in obtaining accurate labels from caregivers for machine learning advancements. This paper presents the design methodology, results, and reflections from our case study and provides insights into development with and for the special needs community.},

The first full-time cohort of UXers were embedded in a team of ML research scientists focused on deep generative models to assist in music composition. Here, we discuss the structure and goals of the program, challenges we faced during execution, and insights gained as a result of the process. We offer practical suggestions for how to foster communication between UX and ML research teams and recommended UX design processes for building creative generative machine learning interfaces.},

This challenging move has been named the “last mile” of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen learnings from involving users in the design or use of AI-based systems. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods, for transitioning from development to implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on healthcare AI in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts of AI in healthcare.},

This article discusses a user-centered approach for the design of interactive auditory feedback using interactive machine learning. We discuss Mapping through Interaction, a method for crafting sonic interactions from corporeal demonstrations of embodied associations between motion and sound. It uses an interactive machine learning approach to build the mapping from user demonstrations, emphasizing an iterative design process that integrates acted and interactive experiences of the relationships between movement and sound. We examine Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression for continuous movement recognition and real-time sound parameter generation. We illustrate and evaluate this approach through an application in which novice users can create interactive sound feedback based on coproduced gestures and vocalizations. Results indicate that Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression can efficiently learn complex motion-sound mappings from few examples.},

abstract = {Motivated by the extensive documented disparate harms of artificial intelligence (AI), many recent practitioner-facing reflective tools have been created to promote responsible AI development. However, the use of such tools internally by technology development firms addresses responsible AI as an issue of closed-door compliance rather than a matter of public concern. Recent advocate and activist efforts intervene in AI as a public policy problem, inciting a growing number of cities to pass bans or other ordinances on AI and surveillance technologies. In support of this broader ecology of political actors, we present a set of reflective tools intended to increase public participation in technology advocacy for AI policy action. To this end, the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit (the AEKit) provides a practical policy-facing definition of AI, a flowchart for assessing technologies against that definition, a worksheet for decomposing AI systems into constituent parts, and a list of probing questions that can be posed to vendors, policy-makers, or government agencies. The AEKit carries an action-orientation towards political encounters between community groups in the public and their representatives, opening up the work of AI reflection and remediation to multiple points of intervention. Unlike current reflective tools available to practitioners, our toolkit carries with it a politics of community participation and activism.},

Preliminary findings indicate that trust can be enhanced in CUIs through greater transparency of actions, enhanced control and clearer privacy settings. It also suggests that design should account for the ways in which trust manifests in sensitive user contexts, like tenancies based on preestablished relationships and power dynamics.},

However, recent transformations in strategies of corporate capture within the tech industry pose significant challenges to established participatory practices. In this paper we extend existing critical participatory design scholarship to highlight the exploitative potential of labor relationships in community collaborations between researchers and participants. Drawing on a reflexive approach to our own experiences conducting agonistic participatory research on emerging technologies at a large technology company, we highlight the limitations of doing participatory work within such contexts by empirically illustrating how and when these relationships threaten to appropriate and alienate participant labor. We argue that a labor-conscious approach to computational systems impact research is critical for countering the commodification of inclusion and invite fellow researchers to more actively investigate such dynamics. To this end, we provide (1) a framework for documenting divisions of labor within participatory research, design, and data practices, and (2) a series of short provocations that help locate and inventory sites of extraction within participatory engagements.},

There has recently been an increased interest into the potentials and challenges of creative collaborations between humans and AI, however, there have not been many practical implementations of co-creative systems. We argue that by designing co-creative systems to support the specific kind of creative design work in hackathons, valuable contributions can be made in the context of an overlooked aspect in interaction design; how to support fast design thinking. The specificity of hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea generation, decision-making, and prototyping, which ideally ends in a functioning and novel prototype. Specifically, we identify three key characteristics of hackathon participation, and for each characteristic we discuss how they may model Human-AI interaction in the context of co-creative systems for fast design thinking. The contribution of this paper is to provide future research on co-creative systems with inspiration grounded in the parallels between aspects of AI and key characteristics of hackathon participation.},

Recent work has started to investigate how humans judge fairness and how to support machine learning experts in making their AI models fairer. Drawing inspiration from an Explainable AI approach called explanatory debugging used in interactive machine learning, our work explores designing interpretable and interactive human-in-the-loop interfaces that allow ordinary end-users without any technical or domain background to identify potential fairness issues and possibly fix them in the context of loan decisions. Through workshops with end-users, we co-designed and implemented a prototype system that allowed end-users to see why predictions were made, and then to change weights on features to “debug” fairness issues. We evaluated the use of this prototype system through an online study. To investigate the implications of diverse human values about fairness around the globe, we also explored how cultural dimensions might play a role in using this prototype. Our results contribute to the design of interfaces to allow end-users to be involved in judging and addressing AI fairness through a human-in-the-loop approach.},

abstract = {Participatory approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are gaining momentum: the increased attention comes partly with the view that participation opens the gateway to an inclusive, equitable, robust, responsible and trustworthy AI. Among other benefits, participatory approaches are essential to understanding and adequately representing the needs, desires and perspectives of historically marginalized communities. However, there currently exists lack of clarity on what meaningful participation entails and what it is expected to do. In this paper we first review participatory approaches as situated in historical contexts as well as participatory methods and practices within the AI and ML pipeline. We then introduce three case studies in participatory AI. Participation holds the potential for beneficial, emancipatory and empowering technology design, development and deployment while also being at risk for concerns such as cooptation and conflation with other activities. We lay out these limitations and concerns and argue that as participatory AI/ML becomes in vogue, a contextual and nuanced understanding of the term as well as consideration of who the primary beneficiaries of participatory activities ought to be constitute crucial factors to realizing the benefits and opportunities that participation brings.},

abstract = {Responsible AI is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of AI. Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.},

abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the behavioral health domain has led to a growing interest in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to identify patterns in people's personal data with the goal of detecting-and even predicting-conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. This paper investigates the data science practices and design narratives that underlie AI-mediated behavioral health through the situational analysis of three natural language processing (NLP) training datasets. Examining datasets as a sociotechnical system inextricably connected to particular social worlds, discourses, and infrastructural arrangements, we identify several misalignments between the technical project of dataset construction and benchmarking (a current focus of AI research in the behavioral health domain) and the social complexity of behavioral health. Our study contributes to a growing critical CSCW literature of AI systems by articulating the sensitizing concept ofdisordering datasets that aims to productively trouble dominant logics of AI/ML applications in behavioral health, and also support researchers and designers in reflecting on their roles and responsibilities working within this emerging and sensitive design space.},

abstract = {The potential of AI to improve people’s lives is unlimited. However, designing AI-infused systems to realize this potential for all is challenging, and it is particularly challenging within under-served minority communities. Revisiting algorithms and data sources to eliminate biases in AI is an important step toward expanding its benefits. However, this leads to the realization that some applications, although unbiased, may simply not be what marginalized communities need. Marginalized communities live in a unique socioeconomic and cultural context and have difficulties taking advantage of traditional AI-powered systems due to language, digital literacy, or other barriers. Additionally, the systems that currently exist usually fail to address the unique challenges in these communities. Therefore, designers and researchers in AI must understand that a fundamental dimension of fairness and ethics is to empower and lift the lives of under-served populations through purposeful human-AI research. This research not only recognizes the unique intersectionality and needs present in each community, but also treats them as the primary audience by overcoming traditional barriers between researchers and underserved communities. This SIG proposal aims to initiate a multidisciplinary discussion around the design of AI systems that are purposefully targeted to marginalized populations. Within this discussion, our objective is to better understand how to conduct research to support and serve these communities – particularly if we are not members of such communities; and challenge the effectiveness of techniques like user-centered design in the context of AI-infused systems when the designer is not a member of the user community. In addition, we will delve into ways of translating research into practical applications to create a positive impact within these communities and narrow the disparities that exist in the optimal utilization of AI to improve lives for different communities.},

abstract = {Sign language datasets are essential to developing many sign language technologies. In particular, datasets are required for training artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. Though the idea of using AI/ML for sign languages is not new, technology has now advanced to a point where developing such sign language technologies is becoming increasingly tractable. This critical juncture provides an opportunity to be thoughtful about an array of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) considerations. Sign language datasets typically contain recordings of people signing, which is highly personal. The rights and responsibilities of the parties involved in data collection and storage are also complex and involve individual data contributors, data collectors or owners, and data users who may interact through a variety of exchange and access mechanisms. Deaf community members (and signers, more generally) are also central stakeholders in any end applications of sign language data. The centrality of sign language to deaf culture identity, coupled with a history of oppression, makes usage by technologists particularly sensitive. This piece presents many of these issues that characterize working with sign language AI datasets, based on the authors’ experiences living, working, and studying in this space.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, human trafficking (where individuals are forcibly exploited for the profits of another) has seen increased attention from the artificial intelligence (AI) community. Clear focus on the ethical risks of this research is critical given that those risks are disproportionately born by already vulnerable populations. To understand and subsequently address these risks, we conducted a systematic literature review of computing research leveraging AI to combat human trafficking and apply a framework using principles from international human rights law to categorize ethical risks. This paper uncovers a number of ethical tensions including bias endemic in datasets, privacy risks stemming from data collection and reporting, and issues concerning potential misuse. We conclude by highlighting four suggestions for future research: broader use of participatory design; engaging with other forms of trafficking; developing best practices for harm prevention; and including transparent ethics disclosures in research. We find that there are significant gaps in what aspects of human trafficking researchers have focused on. Most research to date focuses on aiding criminal investigations in cases of sex trafficking, but more work is needed to support other anti-trafficking activities like supporting survivors, adequately address labor trafficking, and support more diverse survivor populations including transgender and nonbinary individuals.},

In response, we explore the relationship between time and decision making in design processes in order to better understand how this configures power structures. We analyse two design cases: a short-term hackathon and a long-term design process. We argue that the different temporalities of design activities configure decision making — and thereby power — and that both short- and long-term design processes differ in the ways of engaging people in designing technology: Decisions on values and concepts are prioritised in long-term design processes, decisions about implementing the vision are prioritised in short-term design processes, decisions requiring negotiations with the outside world are structurally limited in short-term design processes, non-decisions in short term design processes are pragmatic and habitual in long-term design processes.},

Our primary goal was to inform the first participatory design workshop of Sound of Care, a new eHealth system for pain self-management. We used an ethical stakeholder analysis to inform a round of exploratory interviews, run with 8 participants including people with chronic primary pain, carers, and healthcare workers. We found that sound and technology serve as important but often unstructured tool, helping with distraction, mood regulation and sleep. The experience of pain and musical preferences are highly personal, and communicating or understanding pain can be challenging, even within family members. To address the gaps in current chronic pain self-management care, we propose the use a sound-based AI-driven system, a Digital Pain Companion, using sonification to create a shared decision-making space, enhancing agency over treatment in a co-operative care environment.},

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Children are stakeholders of robotic technologies who deserve to have their voices heard in the design process just as much as adult stakeholders. This is especially true for robotic technologies explicitly designed for child-robot interaction, in areas like education, healthcare, and therapy. Researchers face the challenge of cultivating children's critical awareness on the design of robots and accompanying ethical concerns, as the types of exercises typically used to engage with adult stakeholders can be ineffective with children. This requires developmentally appropriate methods for understanding children's perspectives that also address the imbalanced power dynamics between children and adults, such that children feel comfortable sharing their ideas. In this work, we demonstrate that participatory design research techniques already accepted in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) community can fulfill this purpose. Specifically, through the design and analysis of two co-design workshops with children of different ages at a school in Denver, Colorado, we demonstrate that co-design workshops can be used to effectively understand how children make sense of robotic technologies and to facilitate children's critical reflection on the ethical dilemmas surrounding their own relationships with robots.},

Without appropriate ethical and regulatory frameworks there is a risk that decades of advances in human rights and civil liberties may be undermined. This paper proposes an approach to data curation for AI, grounded in feminist epistemology and informed by critical theories of race and feminist principles. The objective of this approach is to support critical evaluation of the social dynamics of power embedded in data for AI systems. We propose a set of fundamental guiding principles for ethical data curation that address the social construction of knowledge, call for inclusion of subjugated and new forms of knowledge, support critical evaluation of theoretical concepts within data and recognise the reflexive nature of knowledge. In developing this ethical framework for data curation, we aim to contribute to a virtue ethics for AI and ensure protection of fundamental and human rights.},

In this paper, we seek to resolve these divergent positions by identifying the main conceptual limits of formal modeling, and develop four reflexive values--value fidelity, appropriate accuracy, value legibility, and value contestation--vital for incorporating human values adequately into formal models. We then provide a brief methodology for reflexively designing formal models incorporating human values.},

The analysis, based on participant observation and facilitation in nine collaborative research settings, identifies commonalities on how some issues of uncertainty in collaborative knowledge generation contexts can be addressed by both techniques. Results point to the possibility of using dotmocracy and planning poker for articulating decision-making processes among different available options, in order to find consensus in a visual way, and at the same time to make more explicit the degree of agreement and risk perceptions in relation to scientific activities.},

abstract = {Culturally informed design for virtual agents has been shown to positively impact health outcomes when tailored to target audiences. We present a participatory design methodology for culturally tailoring virtual agents. Investigators worked with key informants from our target population, members of predominantly Black church communities, to design culturally-relevant and sensitive virtual agent health promotion interventions. In the first participatory session, key informants designed agents to assist them with different aspects of their lives, providing input on agent appearance and agent functionality. In a second design session, participants re-wrote the content of a health conversation with an agent, to include personally-relevant content related to their community (e.g., religious and scriptural references). We report design principles for religious tailoring derived from these studies. We conducted a validation study to assess the effects of applying these principles to agents that promoted two health behaviors, finding that participants responded very positively to the tailored agents.},

abstract = {Concerns about "black box" machine learning algorithms have influenced why modern data protection laws and regulations on their establishment of a right to human intervention on decision-making supported by artificial intelligence. Such interventions provide data subjects with means to protect their rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, either as a bare minimum requirement for data processing or as a central norm governing decision-aiding artificial intelligence. In this paper, I present contestability by design as an approach to two kinds of issues with current legal implementations of the right to human intervention. The first kind is the uncertainty about what kind of decision should be covered by this right: should intervention be restricted to those decisions with no human involvement, or should it be interpreted in a broader sense, encompassing all decisions that are effectively shaped by automated processing? The second class of issues ensues from practical limitations of this right to intervention: even within a clear conceptual framework, data subjects might still lack the information they need to the concrete exercise of their right, or the human intervention itself might introduce biases and limitations that result in undesirable outcomes. After discussing how those effects can be identified and measured, I then advance the thesis that proper protection of the rights of data subjects is feasible only if there are means for contesting decisions based solely on automated processing is not an afterthought, but instead a requirement at each stage of an artificial intelligence system's lifecycle.},

abstract = {As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.},

abstract = {The intersection of language and identity refers to the ways in which language use reflects and shapes one's sense of self and group membership. It is important to design voice-based technologies that represent and support diverse types of identities to increase accessibility. Due to constraints in the data and algorithms used to train and improve artificial intelligence (AI) systems like social robots or voice assistants, they are often unable to represent certain dialects of English and other languages. This could result in data bias, identity exclusion, and communication barriers that can impact the user's outcomes when using such dialects. Technology companies are discussing how to close this gap by improving training data; however, some researchers believe that the intersection of identity and technology calls for effective collaborative design methodologies that involve intended users. This work-in-progress paper presents preliminary findings on a participatory design method, comic-boarding, that can accomplish the above goal. Using comic-boarding, our intention is to create a space for critical reflection on language and identity in human-human and human-agent dialogue for children from marginalized communities.},

On the other hand, private companies are free to utilise these technologies. Many challenges and barriers must be overcome to have the public adopt these technologies. This one-day workshop will explore disruptive technologies from a local community perspective. We will use a case of artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled electronic ID (eID) for the initial framing and exploration of this problem and compare the differences when the software solution is deployed locally, nationally or internationally. These differences and issues can be looked at, for example, through the lens of trust, usability, security, and privacy.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

abstract = {AI-powered educational technology that is designed to support teachers in providing personalized instruction can enhance their ability to address the needs of individual students, hopefully leading to better learning gains. This paper presents results from a participatory research aimed at co-designing with science teachers a learning analytics tool that will assist them in implementing a personalized pedagogy in blended learning contexts. The development process included three stages. In the first, we interviewed a group of teachers to identify where and how personalized instruction may be integrated into their teaching practices. This yielded a clustering-based personalization strategy. Next, we designed a mock-up of a learning analytics tool that supports this strategy and worked with another group of teachers to define an ‘explainable learning analytics’ scheme that explains each cluster in a way that is both pedagogically meaningful and can be generated automatically. Third, we developed an AI algorithm that supports this ‘explainable clusters’ pedagogy and conducted a controlled experiment that evaluated its contribution to teachers’ ability to plan personalized learning sequences. The planned sequences were evaluated in a blinded fashion by an expert, and the results demonstrated that the experimental group – teachers who received the clusters with the explanations – designed sequences that addressed the difficulties exhibited by different groups of students better than those designed by teachers who received the clusters without explanations. The main contribution of this study is twofold. First, it presents an effective personalization approach that fits blended learning in the science classroom, which combines a real-time clustering algorithm with an explainable-AI scheme that can automatically build pedagogically meaningful explanations from item-level meta-data (Q Matrix). Second, it demonstrates how such an end-to-end learning analytics solution can be built with teachers through a co-design process and highlights the types of knowledge that teachers add to system-provided analytics in order to apply them to their local context. As a practical contribution, this process informed the design of a new learning analytics tool that was integrated into a free online learning platform that is being used by more than 1000 science teachers.},

abstract = {Assistive technologies for older adults (age tech) may support individuals in living a mostly independent life in their own home environment for as long as possible. Especially age tech based on artificial intelligence (AI)-applications may enable a personalization of health and care services and facilitate quality of life. These technologies collect and process large amounts of individual data generated in the daily life and home environment of older adults through various sensors, monitor technologies, and smart wearables. Due to their focus on individual data, these technologies may be tools for tailoring health and care services to the individual needs and benefits of older adults. However, AI-based age tech comes with ethical issues linked to complexity management, i.e. the set of technical means and strategies for dealing with complex or ambiguous data, e.g. user characteristics or behavioral data. Algorithmic standardization might thus conflict with the goal of personalization. In this paper, I identify the crucial ethics issues related to AI-based age tech. I also discuss strategies for dealing with these issues and the fundamental trade-off between complexity management and the personalization of care services through AI-based age tech},

abstract = {Computer aided design (CAD), the use of computer systems for design and documentation, is prevalent in industrial and architectural design, but largely features passive software to follow user interaction. In the past decade, there have been multiple efforts in implementing multi-objective optimization algorithms and machine learning for data analytics in the area of computational optimization of building designs. This research initially explored the technical review of presented designs, and subsequently began to explore the creation of novel forms based on design constraints in addition to parameter optimization. Most notably in the conceptualization phase of the process, the designer is largely unassisted as current existing CAD software focuses on the modeling and basic structural analysis of already created designs. In this position paper, we propose a conceptual framework to leverage computer-assisted creativity in building and form design using evolutionary algorithms, complimented with a comprehensive review of the approaches of other research. We present the preliminary results of our rudimentary implementation of ArchiGen (Architectural Generator), a tool for assisting designers in the conceptualization of a design by presenting alternative forms based on design constraints. ArchiGen uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to create alternative designs of a pillar-pod-antenna structured observation tower as a case study and explores the potential of combining optimal and sub-optimal solutions based on the specified design constraints.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of AI in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that AI systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in AI for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of AI for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive AI systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking AI ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in AI ethics more broadly.},

abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion models and large language models have underpinned a new generation of powerful and accessible tools, and some of the most publicly visible applications are for artistic endeavour. Such tools, however, provide little scope for deeper understanding of AI systems, while the growing public interest in them can eclipse notice of the vibrant community of artists who have long worked with other forms of AI. We explore the potential for AI Art – particularly work in which AI is both tool and topic – to facilitate public AI literacies and consider how tactics developed before the current generative AI boom have continued relevance today. We look at the strategies of critical AI artists to scaffold public understanding of AI and enhance legibility for non-experts. This paper also investigates how collaborations between artists and AI researchers and designers can illuminate key technical and social issues relevant to the development of AI. The study entailed workshops between three professional artists who work with AI and a cross-disciplinary set of academic participants. This paper reports on these workshops and presents the intentions and strategies expressed by the artists, as well as insights of relevance to the research community on public AI literacies. We find that critical AI art can link underlying technical systems to structural issues of power and facilitate experiential learning that is situated and embodied, valuing interpretation over explanation. The findings also demonstrate the importance of transdisciplinary conversations around art, ethics and the political economy of AI technologies and how these dialogues may feed into AI design processes.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) education is an increasingly popular topic area for K-12 teachers. However, little research has investigated how AI curriculum and tools can be designed to be more accessible to all teachers and learners. In this study, we take a Value-Sensitive Design approach to understanding the role of teacher values in the design of AI curriculum and tools, and identifying opportunities to integrate AI into core curriculum to leverage learners’ interests. We organized co-design workshops with 15 K-12 teachers, where teachers and researchers co-created lesson plans using AI tools and embedding AI concepts into various core subjects. We found that K-12 teachers need additional scaffolding in AI tools and curriculum to facilitate ethics and data discussions, and value supports for learner evaluation and engagement, peer-to-peer collaboration, and critical reflection. We present an exemplar lesson plan that shows entry points for teaching AI in non-computing subjects and reflect on co-designing with K-12 teachers in a remote setting.},

Motivated by evidence that sexual consent is already mediated by computers in ways that challenge perceptions of sexual agency, we present a participatory design study in the United States with 17 women and LGBTQ+ stakeholders (demographics at disproportionate risk of sexual violence). Contrary to consent apps that are used right before sex to record irrevocable consent, participants envisioned alternative consent technology being used across online and offline interaction to normalize candid dialogue about sexual expectations and informed verbal consent throughout sex. Findings demonstrate opportunity for dating apps and associated technologies to foster voluntary adoption of affirmative consent, which has been widely advocated in public health for sexual violence prevention yet historically under-adopted by the general public.

As algorithmic decision making increasingly affects our lives, calls to improve the transparency of these systems are met with social, legal and technical limitations that challenge whether transparency alone is the solution to algorithmic accountability. In my dissertation, I explore the role of algorithmic tranparency, algorithmic literacy and related issues as approaches towards holding algorithmic systems more accountable. Bridging HCI and STS communities, my work is grounded in a critical ethnography of algorithmic systems and their impact on its stakeholders. Through this approach, I aim to provide both theoretical insights and material solutions to the problem of accountability. By unpacking the complex socio-technical assemblage that make up these systems and employing both participatory and user-centred design principles, my goal is to co-design measures that support sense-making of algorithmic processes and allow holding these systems accountable.},

abstract = {Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.},

To support designers who aim to engage in a participatory design process in EMS environments, we created and evaluated the Contextual Secondary Video Toolkit (CSVT). This method uses secondary video material and design cards that allow domain experts to identify and prioritise challenges in their work environment and generate design ideas that address them. We illustrate the effects of the CSVT on design processes by analysing four workshops during which aeromedical EMS staff explored the potential of augmented reality to support their work. Our results indicate that the CSVT can support reflection about work practices, aid the generation of design ideas, and facilitate genuine participation. Furthermore, our data indicates that the use of secondary video in design projects is appropriate and even has certain advantages compared to primary field video.},

The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network (AID-N) used participatory design methods to develop an electronic triage system that changed how emergency personnel interacted, collected, and processed data at mass casualty incidents. Through a collaboration between computer scientists, biomedical engineers, usability analysts, paramedics, and medical doctors, AID-N constructed scalable algorithms to monitor a large numbers of patients, an intuitive interface to support overwhelmed responders, and an ad-hoc mesh network that maintained connectivity to patients in ad-hoc, chaotic settings. This paper describes an iterative approach to user-centered design that allows for the collection of a massive amount of data and presents this data in a clear and understandable format to the user.},

We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene.

Through this work, the paper aims to bridge the selected design theories and tools with their practical implementation in digital policy design. The contribution of this paper also includes the introduction of a generalized policy design practice that may be used by government reformers driving the formulation of public policies in central or local governments. The findings also highlight the value of formulating policy design networks of internal and external stakeholders that may support innovative action for the development and implementation of public policies.},

In this paper, we describe a Research-through-Design (RtD) project which explores this shift in the means and modes of image production via the creation and use of the Entoptic Field Camera. Entoptic phenomena usually refer to perceptions of floaters or bright blue dots stemming from the physiological interplay of the eye and brain. We use the term entoptic as a metaphor to investigate how the material interplay of data and models in AI technologies shapes human experiences of reality. Through our case study using first-person design and a field study, we offer implications for critical, reflective, more-than-human and ludic design to engage AI technologies; the conceptualisation of an RtD research space which contributes to AI literacy discourses; and outline a research trajectory concerning materiality and design affordances of AI technologies.},

abstract = {Intelligent systems, which are on their way to becoming mainstream in everyday products, make recommendations and decisions for users based on complex computations. Researchers and policy makers increasingly raise concerns regarding the lack of transparency and comprehensibility of these computations from the user perspective. Our aim is to advance existing UI guidelines for more transparency in complex real-world design scenarios involving multiple stakeholders. To this end, we contribute a stage-based participatory process for designing transparent interfaces incorporating perspectives of users, designers, and providers, which we developed and validated with a commercial intelligent fitness coach. With our work, we hope to provide guidance to practitioners and to pave the way for a pragmatic approach to transparency in intelligent systems.},

We describe a qualitative study examining CHWs’ perceptions of an AI application for automated disease diagnosis. Drawing on data from 21 interviews with CHWs in rural India, we characterize (1) CHWs’ knowledge, perceptions, and understandings of AI; and (2) the benefits and challenges that CHWs anticipate as AI applications are integrated into their workflows, including their opinions on automation of their work, possible misdiagnosis and errors, data access and surveillance issues, security and privacy challenges, and questions concerning trust.

Children's understanding and response to emotions matures alongside their cognitive development. Any model of emotions embedded in an EPA will impact children's responses, and use of the EPA characters. Therefore EPA design should include both user characteristics and the pedagogical purposes behind the CAL system. This paper presents the participatory design of an EPA's affective responses to children's interaction with mathematical software. The participatory design sessions were performed with teachers as partners in designing the affective learning components. The results of a pilot study on children's responses to the emotional sequence defined in the model will be introduced, as a separate study. Finally, a plan of future research is presented to further validate the model's potential for CAL systems, including the integration two software learning applications constructed during the design sessions with teachers},

A structured understanding of how designers work with AI is needed to improve the design process and educate future designers. To that end, we conducted interviews with designers who participated in projects which used AI. While past work focused on AI systems created by experienced designers, we focus on the perspectives of a diverse sample of interaction designers. Our results show that the design process of an interactive system is affected when AI is integrated and that design teams adapt their processes to accommodate AI. Based on our data, we contribute four approaches adopted by interaction designers working with AI: a priori, post-hoc, model-centric, and competence-centric. Our work contributes a pragmatic account of how design processes for AI systems are enacted.},

Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.},

We explore how UXPs communicate AI concepts when given hands-on experience training and experimenting with AI models. To do so, we conducted a task-based design study with 27 UXPs in which they prototyped and created a design presentation for a AI-enabled interface while having access to a simple AI model training tool. Through analyzing UXPs’ design presentations and post-activity interviews, we found that although UXPs struggled to clearly communicate some AI concepts, tinkering with AI broadened common ground when communicating with technical stakeholders. UXPs also identified key risks and benefits of AI in their designs, and proposed concrete next steps for both UX and AI work. We conclude with a sensitizing concept and recommendations for design and AI tools to enhance multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration when crafting human-centered AI experiences.},

Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design AI learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about AI, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity AI literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for AI-related exhibits and directions for future research.},

CSCW and other fields have regularly studied the (positive and negative) social consequences of VAI design and deployment. One particular focus has been questions of gender, and the implications that the (often-feminine) gendering of VAIs has for societal norms and user experiences. Studies into this have largely elided transgender (trans) existences; the few exceptions to this operate largely from an external and predetermined idea of trans and/or non-binary user needs, centered on representation. In this study, we undertook a series of qualitative interviews with trans and/or non-binary users of VAIs to explore their experiences and needs. Our results show that these needs are far more than simply improvements to representation, and that users raise substantial concerns around the underlying framing of gender by even well-intentioned developers, the privacy and safety implications of ubiquitous VAI, and the motivations of the vast for-profit companies that deploy much of this technology. We provide both immediate recommendations for designers and researchers seeking to create trans-inclusive VAIs, and wider, critical proposals for how we as researchers go about assessing technological systems and appropriate points of intervention.},

abstract = {In recent years, discussions of responsible AI practices have seen growing support for ‘participatory AI’ approaches, intended to involve members of the public in the design and development of AI systems. Prior research has identified a lack of standardised methods or approaches for how to use participatory approaches in the AI development process. At present, there is a dearth of evidence on attitudes to and approaches for participation in the sites driving major AI developments: commercial AI labs. Through 12 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners and subject-matter experts, this paper explores how commercial AI labs understand participatory AI approaches and the obstacles they have faced implementing these practices in the development of AI systems and research. We find that while interviewees view participation as a normative project that helps achieve ‘societally beneficial’ AI systems, practitioners face numerous barriers to embedding participatory approaches in their companies: participation is expensive and resource intensive, it is ‘atomised’ within companies, there is concern about exploitation, there is no incentive to be transparent about its adoption, and it is complicated by a lack of clear context. These barriers result in a piecemeal approach to participation that confers no decision-making power to participants and has little ongoing impact for AI labs. This paper’s contribution is to provide novel empirical research on the implementation of public participation in commercial AI labs, and shed light on the current challenges of using participatory approaches in this context.},

abstract = {This paper reports a participatory design study about how dating apps could be designed to mediate sexual consent exchange and ultimately serve as scalable sexual violence prevention solutions. Participants (n=17) were dating app users identifying as LGBTQIA+ or women (demographics at disproportionate risk of sexual violence). Participants envisioned dating apps encouraging safer consent exchange practices by normalizing discussions around consent and sexual boundaries online, before meeting face-to-face with potential sex partners. The design ideas generated by the participants, which we coded as Consent Communication Progression, involved the dating app messaging interface using AI-driven conversation prompts. Such prompts would gradually progress messaging conversations towards topics of consent and sexual boundaries with an algorithm that tailors the prompts to specific users. Participants applied a consent lens when imagining human-AI interaction, in which conversation prompts would only be posted in the interface if the user first consented to the particular conversation occurring. Implications for future work are discussed.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making and big data systems are increasingly being used to provide innovative and essential services in the public sector. Such public services that utilize AI entail many related risks and responsibilities for citizens and public sector providers. Furthermore, the distinct regulatory demands and responsibilities of public sector services require crucial consideration of inclusiveness and civic empowerment. In this empirical study, we examine practitioners’ attitudes, practices and challenges of implementing inclusive AI services in the public sector that can empower greater civic agency. We conducted in-depth interviews with ten practitioners responsible for managing, developing or designing AI-enabled public services across three big public organizations in Finland in domains relating to the municipality, taxes, and social insurance. The results show that the discussion on inclusion and civic empowerment is just in its beginning in the public sector. Practitioners perceive the concept of inclusion as devising accessible public services for all members of society. Civic empowerment was understood as 1) institutional transparency, 2) civic participation in shaping the services, and 3) easing the use of the services for their users. The research suggests two distinct socio-cultural constructs emerging among practitioners that may influence (or hinder) how civic empowerment is manifested in such services: expert cultures and risk-averse cultures. The contributions of the study are twofold. First, we describe the practitioners’ perspectives on empowerment and inclusion in regard to public sector AI. Further, we recognize how expert and risk-averse cultures among practitioners explain their actions and restraints in devising public sector AI services.},

However, comparatively little is known about how functionality for the system behind the interface is designed and how design methodologies such as user-centered design have influence. This research focuses on how interdisciplinary teams that include UX practitioners design real-world enterprise ML systems outside of big technology companies. We conducted a survey with product managers, and interviews with interdisciplinary teams and individual UX practitioners. The findings show that nontechnical UX practitioners are highly capable in designing AI/ML systems. In addition to applying UX and interaction design expertise to make decisions regarding functionality, they employ skills that aid collaboration across interdisciplinary teams. However, our findings suggest existing HCI design techniques such as prototyping and simulating complexity of enterprise ML systems are insufficient. We propose adaptations to design practices and conclude that some existing research should be reconsidered.},

This article identifies four design principles to address this challenge and applies them in a real-world implementation: cloud-based robot control, a modular design, one common knowledge base for all applications, and hybrid artificial intelligence for decision making and reasoning. The control architecture for this robot includes a common Knowledge-base (ontologies), Data-base, “Hybrid Artificial Brain” (dialogue manager, action selection and explainable AI), Activities Centre (Timeline, Quiz, Break and Sort, Memory, Tip of the Day, ( ldots ) ), Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA, i.e., robot and avatar), and Dashboards (for authoring and monitoring the interaction). Further, the ECA is integrated with an expandable set of (mobile) health applications. The resulting system is a Personal Assistant for a healthy Lifestyle (PAL), which supports diabetic children with self-management and educates them on health-related issues (48 children, aged 6–14, recruited via hospitals in the Netherlands and in Italy). It is capable of autonomous interaction “in the wild” for prolonged periods of time without the need for a “Wizard-of-Oz” (up until 6 months online). PAL is an exemplary system that provides personalised, stable and diverse, long-term human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {Investigative journalists and public defenders conduct the essential work of examining, reporting, and arguing critical cases around police use-of-force and misconduct. In an ideal world, they would have access to well-organized records they can easily navigate and search. In reality, records can come as large, disorganized data dumps, increasing the burden on the already resource-constrained teams. In a cross-disciplinary research team of stakeholders and computer scientists, we worked closely with public defenders and investigative journalists in the United States to co-design an AI-augmented tool that addresses challenges in working with such data dumps. Our Document Organization Tool (DOT) is a Python library that has data cleaning, extraction, and organization features. Our collaborative design process gave us insights into the needs of under-resourced teams who work with large data dumps, such as how some domain experts became self-taught programmers to automate their tasks. To understand what type of programming paradigm could support our target users, we conducted a user study (n=18) comparing visual, programming-by-example, and traditional text-based programming tools. From our user study, we found that once users passed the initial learning stage, they could comfortably use all three paradigms. Our work offers insights for designers working with under-resourced teams who want to consolidate cutting-edge algorithms and AI techniques into unified, expressive tools. We argue user-centered tool design can contribute to the broader fight for accountability and transparency by supporting existing practitioners in their work in domains like criminal justice.},

Facial recognition technology has been demonstrated to be more likely to misidentify women and minoritized people. This risk, among others, has elevated facial recognition into policy discussions across the country, where many jurisdictions have already passed bans on its use. Whereas scholarship on the disparate impacts of algorithmic systems is growing, general public awareness of this set of problems is limited in part by the illegibility of machine learning systems to non-specialists. Inspired by discussions with community organizers advocating for tech fairness issues, we created the Face Mis-ID Demo to reveal the algorithmic functions behind facial recognition technology and to demonstrate its risks to policymakers and members of the community. In this paper, we share the design process behind this interactive demo, its form and function, and the design decisions that honed its accessibility, toward its use for improving legibility of algorithmic systems and awareness of the sources of their disparate impacts.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) are one form of datafication. They are virtual reflections of physical world entities, of objects and phenomena, and are rapidly becoming an asset for innovation. There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.},

abstract = {Major natural or man-made disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the 9/11 terror attacks pose significant challenges for emergency responders. First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in the most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowd-sourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system.},

abstract = {Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease affecting 264 million people worldwide. While many antidepressant medications are available, few clinical guidelines support choosing among them. Decision support tools (DSTs) embodying machine learning models may help improve the treatment selection process, but often fail in clinical practice due to poor system integration. We use an iterative, co-design process to investigate clinicians’ perceptions of using DSTs in antidepressant treatment decisions. We identify ways in which DSTs need to engage with the healthcare sociotechnical system, including clinical processes, patient preferences, resource constraints, and domain knowledge. Our results suggest that clinical DSTs should be designed as multi-user systems that support patient-provider collaboration and offer on-demand explanations that address discrepancies between predictions and current standards of care. Through this work, we demonstrate how current trends in explainable AI may be inappropriate for clinical environments and consider paths towards designing these tools for real-world medical systems.},

abstract = {We are developing a social robot to help children cope with painful and distressing medical procedures in the hospital emergency department. This is a domain where a range of interventions have proven effective at reducing pain and distress, including social robots; however, until now, the robots have been designed with limited stakeholder involvement and have shown limited autonomy. For our system, we have defined and validated the necessary robot behaviour together with children, parents/caregivers, and healthcare professionals, taking into account the ethical and social implications of robotics and AI in the paediatric healthcare context. The result of the co-design process has been captured in a flowchart, which has been converted into a set of concrete design guidelines for the AI-based autonomous robot system.},

abstract = {Algorithms are increasingly being implemented into core welfare areas as Public Employment Services. These data-driven technologies are implemented with the ambition to support caseworkers' decision-making capabilities, by profiling unemployed individual's risk of long-term unemployment. The research outlined in this paper investigates how we can study opaque technologies as algorithms from the perspective of the users (caseworkers) and those categorized (unemployed individuals) by these systems. This is done by combining established methods within Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, including ethnographic fieldwork and Participatory Design methods. I present preliminary results focused on caseworker's perception of the value of AI in job placement, and find documentation plays a central role in collaboration in casework. With this research, I am to contribute to a deeper understanding of how the organization of work is impacted by data-driven technologies like AI and explore ways to include the voice of unemployed individuals in the development of digital public services.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to manage the workforce. Algorithmic management promises organizational efficiency, but often undermines worker well-being. How can we computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory approach for worker well-being models. We first define worker well-being models: Work preference models---preferences about work and working conditions, and managerial fairness models---beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple workers. We then propose elicitation methods to enable workers to build their own well-being models leveraging pairwise comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25 shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of empowerment. Our work provides a method and initial evidence for enabling participatory algorithmic management for worker well-being.},

Many studies were conducted in diverse aspects to find usable and useful features and functionalities. In this paper, we discuss how to design and structure a participatory design workshop and wizard of Oz with users, especially in the situation of developing a new presentation tool. Our approach to structure participatory design is to embed three phases based on principles of human-centered design. We extend the design method to achieve more useful and usable concepts. In the first phase, end-users engaged in building initial concepts. In the second phase, the users evaluated their initial idea and refined the design concepts. In the last phase, extended user groups gave feedback about usability issues in the tested platform. In the lessons learned, we highlight two major issues observed in this our design method: (a) evolving design fidelity and (b) comprehension of own design.},

While the goal of critical technical practice as proposed by [1] is to overcome technical impasses, I explore an alternative use case - ensuring that technical research is aligned with social values. In the design of AI systems, we generally start with a technical formulation of a problem and then attempt to build a system that addresses that problem. Critical technical practice tells us that this technical formulation is always founded upon the discipline's core discourse and ontology, and that difficulty in solving a technical problem might just result from inconsistencies and faults in those core attributes. What I hope to show with this project is that, even when a technical problem seems solvable, critical technical practice can and should be used to ensure the human-compatibility of the technical research.},

abstract = {Child welfare agencies across the United States are turning to data-driven predictive technologies (commonly called predictive analytics) which use government administrative data to assist workers’ decision-making. While some prior work has explored impacted stakeholders’ concerns with current uses of data-driven predictive risk models (PRMs), less work has asked stakeholders whether such tools ought to be used in the first place. In this work, we conducted a set of seven design workshops with 35 stakeholders who have been impacted by the child welfare system or who work in it to understand their beliefs and concerns around PRMs, and to engage them in imagining new uses of data and technologies in the child welfare system. We found that participants worried current PRMs perpetuate or exacerbate existing problems in child welfare. Participants suggested new ways to use data and data-driven tools to better support impacted communities and suggested paths to mitigate possible harms of these tools. Participants also suggested low-tech or no-tech alternatives to PRMs to address problems in child welfare. Our study sheds light on how researchers and designers can work in solidarity with impacted communities, possibly to circumvent or oppose child welfare agencies.},

Digital support for journalists when investigating and writing about science-related topics is one means of improving this science communication. However, little bespoke digital support is available. This paper reports the research and development of one new form of such digital support. During a participatory design process, experienced science journalists and other professionals were interviewed about their challenges experienced and understanding of good practices in science journalism. These challenges and good practices informed the development of a prototype of a new form of digital tool that was evaluated by journalists without specialist science training. A new version of the prototype, called INQUEST, was implemented to automate some parts of good practices in order to augment journalists’ capabilities. These practices included the retrieval of science information from diverse sources, targeting different science audiences, and providing different forms of guidance for explaining science to the target audience. This prototype is presented, and an early evaluation of it is reported.},

One proposal for addressing such issues in automated decision making is by designing for contestability, whereby users can shape and influence how decisions are made. In this study, we conduct a series of participatory design workshops with participants from communities that have experienced problems with social media content moderation in the past. Together with participants, we explore the idea of designing for contestability in content moderation and find that users' designs suggest three fruitful, practical avenues: adding representation, improving communication, and designing with compassion. We conclude with design recommendations drawn from participants' proposals, and reflect on the challenges that remain.},

However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1)&nbsp;divergent perspectives on fairness, 2)&nbsp;the accuracy of AI, 3)&nbsp;the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4)&nbsp;the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5)&nbsp;the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace.},

In Human-Centered AI discourses, and more broadly in Human-Computer Interaction research, initiatives have been proposed to engage experts from various domains of social science in determining how AI should reach our societies, predominantly through informing the adoption policies. Our contribution, however, seeks a more essential role for social sciences, namely to introduce discursive standpoints around what we need AI to be. With a focus on the domain of urbanism, the specific goal has been to elicit – from interviews with 16 urban experts – the imaginaries of how AI can and should impact future cities. Drawing on the social science literature, we present how the notion of “imaginary” has essentially framed this research and how it could reveal an alternative vision of non-human intelligent actors in future cities.},

abstract = {Organizations have recently begun to deploy conversational task assistants that collaborate with knowledge workers to partially automate their work tasks. These assistants evolved out of business robotic process automation (RPA) tools and are becoming more intelligent: users can initiate task sequences through natural language, and the system can orchestrate those tasks if they have not previously been defined. As these tools become more automated, system designers tend to optimize overall process efficiency, but at the cost of shifting agency away from workers. Particularly in high stakes work environments, this shift raises questions of how to re-delegate agency such that workers feel sufficiently in control of automated tasks. We explored this through two studies comprised of interviews and co-design activities with knowledge workers and identified four task dimensions along which their automation and interaction preferences vary: process consequence, social consequence, task familiarity, and task complexity. These dimensions are useful for understanding when, why, and how to delegate agency between workers and conversational task assistants.},

Participatory Design (PD) approaches are particularly well-suited to contributing to contemporary debates of decolonization in design due to PD’s long-standing political traditions and values of equality and empowerment, but even here empirical methods and techniques to fully realize pluriversality in design are lacking. In line with the CHI 2021 theme of Making Waves. Combining Strengths, this interactive workshop will invigorate the debates and practices in HCI of decolonization by bringing together and demonstrating how designers and researchers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes, concepts, methodologies and sensibilities into decolonizing design practices.

We found that novice facilitators employed many strategies to overcome initial discomfort. In particular, they attempted to incite conversation through side channels and cold-calling, and leveraged improvisation strategies to deal with unexpected situations. They also relied on support structures to make in-the-moment decisions. Our findings suggest that the design facilitators found their experiences meaningful for both their personal growth and for advancing their career aspirations.},

In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.},

abstract = {Can government govern artificial intelligence (AI)? One of the central questions of AI governance surrounds state capacity, namely whether government has the ability to accomplish its policy goals. We study this question by assessing how well the U.S. federal government has implemented three binding laws around AI governance: two executive orders—concerning trustworthy AI in the public sector (E.O. 13,960) and AI leadership (E.O. 13,859)—and the AI in Government Act. We conduct the first systematic empirical assessment of the implementation status of these three laws, which have each been described as central to US AI innovation. First, we track, through extensive research, line-level adoption of each mandated action. Based on publicly available information, we find that fewer than 40 percent of 45 legal requirements could be verified as having been implemented. Second, we research the specific implementation of transparency requirements at up to 220 federal agencies. We find that nearly half of agencies failed to publicly issue AI use case inventories—even when these agencies have demonstrable use cases of machine learning. Even when agencies have complied with these requirements, efforts are inconsistent. Our work highlights the weakness of U.S. state capacity to carry out AI governance mandates and we discuss implications for how to address bureaucratic capacity challenges.},

abstract = {Ranging from subtle to overt, unintentional to systemic, navigating racism is additional everyday work for many people. Yet the needs of people who experience racism have been overlooked as a fertile ground for better technology. Through a series of workshops we call Foundational Fiction, we engaged BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) in participatory design to identify qualities of technology that can support people coping before, during, and after a racist interaction. Participants developed storyboards for digital tools that offer advice, predict consequences, identify racist remarks and intervene, educate both targets and perpetrators about interpersonal and systemic racism, and more. In the paper we present our workshop method utilizing interactive fiction, participants’ design concepts, prevalent themes (reducing uncertainty and offering comfort), and we provide critical analysis of the complexity of technology in these contexts. This work identifies specific opportunities for exploring anti-racist social tools.},

While a paper itself can only discuss prior work, some scientific search engines can provide a list of all subsequent citing papers; unfortunately, they are undifferentiated and disconnected from the contents of the original reference paper. In this work, we introduce a novel paper reading experience that integrates relevant information about follow-on work directly into a paper, allowing readers to learn about newer papers and see how a paper is discussed by its citing papers in the context of the reference paper. We built a tool, called CiteRead, that implements the following three contributions: 1) automated techniques for selecting important citing papers, building on results from a formative study we conducted, 2) an automated process for localizing commentary provided by citing papers to a place in the reference paper, and 3) an interactive experience that allows readers to seamlessly alternate between the reference paper and information from citing papers (e.g., citation sentences), placed in the margins. Based on a user study with 12 scientists, we found that in comparison to having just a list of citing papers and their citation sentences, the use of CiteRead while reading allows for better comprehension and retention of information about follow-on work.},

Based on these workshops, we present how cultural norms such as hlonipha facilitated learning opportunities for participants’ engagement with gender norms and relations with community leaders and senior members of the community. We also describe stark contrasts with regards to cultural norms between rural and urban sites and their implications for co-design activities. By reflecting on the multi-linguistic, social, and cultural challenges conducting workshops across geographic locations, we discuss how cultural nuances influenced co-design workshops and artefacts. Adjustments to the rhythms of the workshops and co-design activities enabled ”transferability” between rural and urban settings, and across diverse cultures, regardless of whether these settings include members from the same cultures.},

abstract = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

abstract = {City, municipal, and state governments around the globe are increasingly looking towards algorithmic solutions to long-standing and difficult problems in governance. We use the term algorithmic governance to capture this increasing use of predictive and other algorithms to provide efficiencies in the targeting of services and government processes. However, in the course of pursuing these efficiencies, openness, transparency, public accountability, and community-based deliberation, key pillars of democracy, come under threat when decision making is black-boxed in an algorithm. Furthermore, algorithmic governance (for example, in domains like welfare management) typically exacerbates the marginalization of the most disadvantaged in society, while simultaneously making such marginalization invisible to the larger citizenry. A hybrid technology assessment (TA) comprising of elements of both participatory TA (that involves public debate about technology) and constructive TA (that involves co-construction of technology between society and designers) employed through the framework of engineering technology for social justice, may help address these challenges.},

Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.},

In this paper we propose a method based on Semiotic theory for understanding the child's process of signification for design elements in the Internet media, and reflecting this understanding in the design of a portal for children. Our approach draw upon techniques from Participatory Design (PD) and concepts from Organizational Semiotics (OS). PD has shown usefulness in the investigation of children's conceptions for Internet spaces, and OS has shown a sound theoretical approach to represent in ontology charts children's signification to elements of design. The proposed methodology is illustrated with the design process of Caleidoscopio Jr: a Web portal for children designed with them.},

abstract = {Nonverbal vocalizations contain important affective and communicative information, especially for those who do not use traditional speech, including individuals who have autism and are non- or minimally verbal (nv/mv). Although these vocalizations are often understood by those who know them well, they can be challenging to understand for the community-at-large. This work presents (1) a methodology for collecting spontaneous vocalizations from nv/mv individuals in natural environments, with no researcher present, and personalized in-the-moment labels from a family member; (2) speaker-dependent classification of these real-world sounds for three nv/mv individuals; and (3) an interactive application to translate the nonverbal vocalizations in real time. Using support-vector machine and random forest models, we achieved speaker-dependent unweighted average recalls (UARs) of 0.75, 0.53, and 0.79 for the three individuals, respectively, with each model discriminating between 5 nonverbal vocalization classes. We also present first results for real-time binary classification of positive- and negative-affect nonverbal vocalizations, trained using a commercial wearable microphone and tested in real time using a smartphone. This work informs personalized machine learning methods for non-traditional communicators and advances real-world interactive augmentative technology for an underserved population.},

To address the lack of systematic understanding of how these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome, and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends and advocate for a human-centered approach.},

In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology.},

abstract = {Digital books may read to the reader, allowing parents with the lowest levels of literacy to explore stories with their children and help break the chain of illiteracy. An interactive electronic format also allows including multiple languages without sacrificing space on a page for attractive images---both key features for teaching young children to read in a setting where multiple languages are spoken in the home, or where a mother tongue is not the language of instruction. This paper describes collaborative development of a digital, multi-language reading tool that facilitates translation of local stories by Kenyan community groups, led by a librarian, into a mother tongue. Despite being built faithfully using a well-established design methodology in an iterative process among beneficiaries, program leaders, and technologists, and in a process embedded in a program also designed according to those design standards, tool development has faced serious challenges. This paper uses a principal agent model to identify technology-mediated communication and spatial distance among critical participants as major hindrances to progress. Analysis reveals critical disparities between, on one hand, the design thinking of development practitioners and funders, which rhetorically promote a circular, dynamic, participatory design process, and, on the other hand, traditional funding structures which impose at least partial adherence to a top-down approach.},

abstract = {While anomaly detection stands among the most important and valuable problems across many scientific domains, anomaly detection research often focuses on AI methods that can lack the nuance and interpretability so critical to conducting scientific inquiry. We believe this exclusive focus on algorithms with a fixed framing ultimately blocks scientists from adopting even high-accuracy anomaly detection models in many scientific use cases. In this application paper we present the results of utilizing an alternative approach that situates the mathematical framing of machine learning based anomaly detection within a participatory design framework. In a collaboration with NASA scientists working with the PIXL instrument studying Martian planetary geochemistry as a part of the search for extra-terrestrial life; we report on over 18 months of in-context user research and co-design to define the key problems NASA scientists face when looking to detect and interpret spectral anomalies. We address these problems and develop a novel spectral anomaly detection toolkit for PIXL scientists that is highly accurate (93.4% test accuracy on detecting diffraction anomalies), while maintaining strong transparency to scientific interpretation. We also describe outcomes from a yearlong field deployment of the algorithm and associated interface, now used daily as a core component of the PIXL science team’s workflow, and directly situate the algorithm as a key contributor to discoveries around the potential habitability of Mars. Finally we introduce a new design framework which we developed through the course of this collaboration for co-creating anomaly detection algorithms: Iterative Semantic Heuristic Modeling of Anomalous Phenomena (ISHMAP), which provides a process for scientists and researchers to produce natively interpretable anomaly detection models. This work showcases an example of successfully bridging methodologies from AI and HCI within a scientific domain, and provides a resource in ISHMAP which may be used by other researchers and practitioners looking to partner with other scientific teams to achieve better science through more effective and interpretable anomaly detection tools.},

abstract = {Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.},

However, little work has investigated alternative platform designs to promote worker well-being, particularly from workers’ own perspectives. We use a participatory design approach wherein workers explore their algorithmic imaginaries to co-design interventions that center their lived experiences, preferences, and well-being in algorithmic management. Our interview and participatory design sessions highlight how various design dimensions of algorithmic management, including information asymmetries and unfair, manipulative incentives, hurt worker well-being. Workers generate designs to address these issues while considering competing interests of the platforms, customers, and themselves, such as information translucency, incentives co-configured by workers and platforms, worker-centered data-driven insights for well-being, and collective driver data sharing. Our work offers a case study that responds to a call for designing worker-centered digital work and contributes to emerging literature on algorithmic work.},

abstract = {Online threats to children, in the form of cyberbullying, grooming, and sexting, have reached unprecedented and alarming levels. Support is still lacking despite endless efforts by child safety organisations and online safety educational programmes. This is mainly due to children feeling apprehensive in such situations, ashamed of revealing their distressing encounter to an adult or even for not having anyone to approach with their concerns. This paper investigates how children envision the potential support of a chatbot in such contexts. We captured design requirements for such a chatbot through a participatory design approach involving 110 schoolchildren in the UK. Using LEGO figures, they elaborated and performed stories featuring the interaction of a child under threat with a chatbot. The analysis of the dialogues in their performances and their reflections resulted in a set of expected tasks for the chatbot, a conversation flow, and novel socio-technical requirements addressing potential users’ main concerns and expectations.},

abstract = {Despite substantial advancements in healthcare systems and management, little progress has been achieved in addressing supply chain constraints such as, inefficient purchasing, ordering, predicting, and administration procedures. Healthcare authorities needs to effectively manage the healthcare supply chain processes not just during pandemics like COVID-19, but also in their everyday operations to guarantee best possible services. Product recalls, product supply shortage monitoring, expiry, and counterfeiting are some of the critical healthcare supply chain operations which must be ensured. Our suggested solution combines blockchain technology and distributed storage to increase transparency, improve stakeholder communication, and shorten product procurement timelines while eliminating crucial disparities and faults. We present a generic framework for the healthcare supply chain, equipped with comprehensive algorithms showing various stakeholder interactions. Our system uses the Ethereum network to link all parties, including the healthcare authority, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and healthcare provider. Remix IDE platform was used to develop and test the smart contract codes. As decentralized storage, we have used the combination of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric. We have also examined a variety of security issues, provided a cost analysis of the various transactions proposed in our solution while making comparison with similar blockchain-based solutions.},

abstract = {This year's conference theme "HRI for all" not just raises the importance of reflecting on how to promote inclusion for every type of user but also calls for careful consideration of the different layers of people potentially impacted by such systems. In educational setups, for instance, the users to be considered first and foremost are the learners. However, teachers, school directors, therapists and parents also form a more secondary layer of users in this ecosystem. The 7th edition of R4L focuses on the issues that HRI experiments in educational environments may cause to stakeholders and how we could improve on bringing the stakeholders' point of view into the loop. This goal is expected to be achieved in a very practical and dynamic way by the means of: (i) lightening talks from the participants; (ii) two discussion panels with special guests: One with active researchers from academia and industry about their experience and point of view regarding the inclusion of stakeholders; another panel with teacher, school directors, and parents that are/were involved in HRI experiments and will share their viewpoint; (iii) semi-structured group discussions and hands-on activities with participants and panellists to evaluate and propose guidelines for good practices regarding how to promote the inclusion of stakeholders, especially teachers, in educational HRI activities. By acquiring the viewpoint from the experimenters and stakeholders and analysing them in the same workshop, we expect to identify current gaps, propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps, and capitalise on existing synergies with the collective intelligence of the two communities.},

The highly dynamic nature of behavioral data makes it deeply intertwined with people, their behavior, and their experiences. Thus, it presents unique opportunities and challenges. This Special Interest Group will provide a space to reflect and discuss effective and responsible ways to engage with behavioral data in human-centered design processes. We will explore questions about the types and scale of data used, the contexts in which data is embedded and applied, the methods we rely on, and the forms of engagement of the multiple stakeholders. In doing so, our goal is to collaboratively develop a research agenda, setting the scope for an annual, international symposium on Data-Centric Design.},

By engaging 66 citizens in the critical assessment of futuristic designs of spaces, we reveal their needs and concerns about possible futures. Our findings show that citizens are concerned with the ecological limitations of urban technology, reliability, and data privacy. They also welcome the positive implications of adaptive environments and technological advancement. Participants were also reflective of how urban technology can change human experience, more generally. Our findings point to the need for flexibility, privacy, and adaptability to changing contexts, stimuli, and users in human-building interaction.},

Existing tools for family memories often take a techno-determinist approach by focusing on the mechanics of connecting families and the resulting documentation, rather than the social process of sharing stories and morals, and largely without considering the specific needs of immigrant families. For immigrant families, cultural exchange, particularly crucial across grandparent and grandchild generations, is threatened by the language and cultural barriers emerging from displacement and migration. As a result, immigrant grandparents and their young grandchildren struggle with fostering social kinship, leading to social disconnect and loss of cultural heritage. In our research, we collaborate with multi-generational and culturally-at-risk immigrant families through Participatory Design activities towards the design of reminiscence tools that support their needs focusing on language and cultural connection. We report on the designs created by families and propose design guidelines supporting cultural resilience, focusing on flexible, visual storytelling.},

The co-design process followed an artistic approach and consisted of three cycles of labs, workshops and events during the span of one year to support professionals with non-technical background in the ideation and conceptualization of possible futures. The artistic approach consisted of different exploration perspectives of technology through the use of embodiment, artifacts and creation of speculative fictions. The research team that facilitated the labs was interdisciplinary and the participants were assembled from different partner organizations from industry and public sector. We share the learnings from this study attending to three different perspectives: our learnings from the facilitation of the artistic approach, our learnings from the future of work ideas and concepts developed by participants, and discussion of what these learnings can mean to design practitioners and the research community. Results indicate that embodiment and speculative fiction can create engagement among professionals that lack technical expertise and support them in collaborative exploration of alternative futures of work with novel and abstract technologies such as AI.},

Understanding how non-ML experts comprehend these platforms is important in supporting participants in making an informed choice about if and how they adopt these platforms. To aid this decision-making process, we created a companion guide for a home health platform through an iterative user-centred-design process, seeking additional input from platform experts at all stages of the process to ensure the accuracy of explanations.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems operate in increasingly diverse areas, from healthcare to facial recognition, the stock market, autonomous vehicles, and so on. While the underlying digital infrastructure of AI systems is developing rapidly, each area of implementation is subject to different degrees and processes of legitimization. By combining elements from institutional theory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual framework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction of novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which algorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing institutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which organizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure and governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still are unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be contested. The institutional infrastructure surrounding AI-induced fields is generally little elaborated, which could be an obstacle to the broader institutionalization of AI-systems going forward.},

AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to support AAC users by improving the quality and variety of text suggestions. However, these technologies may fundamentally change how users interact with AAC devices as users transition from typing their own phrases to prompting and selecting AI-generated phrases. We conducted a study in which 12 AAC users tested live suggestions from a language model across three usage scenarios: extending short replies, answering biographical questions, and requesting assistance. Our study participants believed that AI-generated phrases could save time, physical and cognitive effort when communicating, but felt it was important that these phrases reflect their own communication style and preferences. This work identifies opportunities and challenges for future AI-enhanced AAC devices.},

abstract = {Inappropriate design and deployment of machine learning (ML) systems lead to negative downstream social and ethical impacts – described here as social and ethical risks – for users, society, and the environment. Despite the growing need to regulate ML systems, current processes for assessing and mitigating risks are disjointed and inconsistent. We interviewed 30 industry practitioners on their current social and ethical risk management practices and collected their first reactions on adapting safety engineering frameworks into their practice – namely, System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Our findings suggest STPA/FMEA can provide an appropriate structure for social and ethical risk assessment and mitigation processes. However, we also find nontrivial challenges in integrating such frameworks in the fast-paced culture of the ML industry. We call on the CHI community to strengthen existing frameworks and assess their efficacy, ensuring that ML systems are safer for all people.},

abstract = {Sociotechnical imaginaries are futures that people envision might be possible and desirable. They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers' disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers' disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.},

However, little is known about how children conceptualize AR, especially AR headsets. Prior work has shown that children's interaction behaviors and expectations of technological devices can be quite different from adults’. It is important to understand children's mental models of AR headsets to design more effective experiences for them. To elicit children's perceptions, we conducted four participatory design sessions with ten children on designing content for imaginary AR headsets. We found that children expect AR systems to be highly intelligent and to recognize and virtually transform surroundings to create immersive environments. Also, children are in favor of using these devices for difficult tasks but prefer to work on their own for easy tasks. Our work contributes new understanding on how children comprehend AR headsets and provides recommendations for designing future headsets for children.},

abstract = {Data-driven and algorithmic systems have been introduced to support Public Employment Services (PES) throughout the world. Their deployment has sparked public controversy and, as a consequence, some of these systems have been removed from use or their role was reduced. Yet the implementation of similar systems continues. In this paper, we use a participatory approach to determine a course forward for research and development in this area. We draw attention to the needs and expectations of people directly affected by these systems, i.e., jobseekers. Our investigation comprises two workshops: the first a fact-finding workshop with academics, system developers, the public sector, and civil-society organizations, the second a co-design workshop with 13 unemployed migrants to Germany. Based on the discussion in the fact-finding workshop we identified challenges of existing PES (algorithmic) systems. From the co-design workshop we identified our participants’ needs and desires when contacting PES: the need for human contact, the expectation to receive genuine orientation, and the desire to be seen as a whole human being. We map these expectations to three design considerations for data-driven and algorithmic systems for PES: the importance of interpersonal interaction, jobseeker assessment as direction, and the challenge of mitigating misrepresentation. Finally, we argue that the limitations and risks of current systems cannot be addressed through minor adjustments but require a more fundamental change to the role of PES.},

We argue that to effectively involve a broad range of users in the design of new technologies, it is important to actively develop a shared language that is accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that facilitates productive dialogues among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly in work with end users, in which problematic language emerged as a key barrier to participation and effective design. Three specific categories of language barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words. Building on this we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on generating a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that emerged of alternative terminology and specific strategies for creating a shared language.},

In these so-called "bottom-up" approaches, users are becoming designers of their game experience. In this paper, we report on an online study where participants (n=140) described a gamification concept, without restricting them to a set of game elements to select from. This was done to analyze how they perform in such a task. The concepts were qualitatively evaluated for which game elements were proposed, showing that participants suggested many diverse concepts with a broad range of elements. The results provide further support for "bottom-up" approaches. Additionally, the suggested game elements were compared to every participant's Hexad user type and Big Five personality. Our data hints that both seem not to be dominant factors influencing which elements participants use in such a design task.},

We examine children's perspectives of financial literacy and digital technologies through a study of nine participatory design sessions with children (ages 7 – 11) centered around ideating, evaluating, and designing technologies for children's finances. Our co-design findings demonstrate that children's relationship to money can be quite complex in the digital world. Empirically, we report three inductive themes that demonstrate the role that technology plays in children's financial literacy. Theoretically, we argue the need for child-computer interaction research to engage more in financial literacy for children. Finally, we reflect on co-designing for financial literacy, technology, and children.},

abstract = {In society today, people experiencing disability can face discrimination. As artificial intelligence solutions take on increasingly important roles in decision-making and interaction, they have the potential to impact fair treatment of people with disabilities in society both positively and negatively. We describe some of the opportunities and risks across four emerging AI application areas: employment, education, public safety, and healthcare, identified in a workshop with participants experiencing a range of disabilities. In many existing situations, non-AI solutions are already discriminatory, and introducing AI runs the risk of simply perpetuating and replicating these flaws. We next discuss strategies for supporting fairness in the context of disability throughout the AI development lifecycle. AI systems should be reviewed for potential impact on the user in their broader context of use. They should offer opportunities to redress errors, and for users and those impacted to raise fairness concerns. People with disabilities should be included when sourcing data to build models, and in testing, to create a more inclusive and robust system. Finally, we offer pointers into an established body of literature on human-centered design processes and philosophies that may assist AI and ML engineers in innovating algorithms that reduce harm and ultimately enhance the lives of people with disabilities.},

Prior work has explored how people believe algorithmic decisions should be made, but there is little understanding of how individual factors like sociodemographics or direct experience with a decision-making scenario may affect their ethical views. We take a step toward filling this gap by exploring how people’s perceptions of one aspect of procedural algorithmic fairness (the fairness of using particular features in an algorithmic decision) relate to their (i) demographics (age, education, gender, race, political views) and (ii) personal experiences with the algorithmic decision-making scenario. We find that political views and personal experience with the algorithmic decision context significantly influence perceptions about the fairness of using different features for bail decision-making. Drawing on our results, we discuss the implications for stakeholder engagement and algorithmic oversight including the need to consider multiple dimensions of diversity in composing oversight and regulatory bodies.},

abstract = {Social service providers play a vital role in the developmental outcomes of underprivileged youth as they transition into adulthood. Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector.},

These concerns must be considered to assure the adoption of SAVs from women and senior citizens, too. Accordingly, we conducted a qualitative user study (N=21) using participatory design methods. Our work contributes insights into women’s security needs by taking a holistic view of a ride with an SAV from booking to arrival from the perspective of women of different age groups. From our results, we derived general design implications and propose three concrete concepts for high levels of security. Lastly, we present a research agenda for further investigation on security concepts in SAVs.},

abstract = {As a means of exploring the design space for supporting individuals who have had personal experiences with racism, we developed a Participatory Design (PD) method, Foundational Fiction, that addresses some unique concerns with using traditional PD to explore deeply sensitive topics. Challenging the assumption that PD must begin with a solicitation of participants' real lived experiences, we instead created a fictional interactive narrative for participants to work from. In the preliminary analysis, we observe that the use of a shared fiction relieved participants of the requirement to disclose very personal experiences, but nonetheless established a group understanding of what makes racist experiences difficult and supported a generative conversation about how technology might ease these situations.},

abstract = {The use of semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to support emergency response scenarios, such as fire surveillance and search and rescue, offers the potential for huge societal benefits. However, designing an effective solution in this complex domain represents a "wicked design" problem, requiring a careful balance between trade-offs associated with drone autonomy versus human control, mission functionality versus safety, and the diverse needs of different stakeholders. This paper focuses on designing for situational awareness (SA) using a scenario-driven, participatory design process. We developed SA cards describing six common design-problems, known as SA demons, and three new demons of importance to our domain. We then used these SA cards to equip domain experts with SA knowledge so that they could more fully engage in the design process. We designed a potentially reusable solution for achieving SA in multi-stakeholder, multi-UAV, emergency response applications.},

Previous research has addressed this issue by proposing standardized checklists to document datasets. This paper expands that field of inquiry by proposing a shift of perspective: from documenting datasets towards documenting data production. We draw on participatory design and collaborate with data workers at two companies located in Bulgaria and Argentina, where the collection and annotation of data for machine learning are outsourced. Our investigation comprises 2.5 years of research, including 33 semi-structured interviews, five co-design workshops, the development of prototypes, and several feedback instances with participants. We identify key challenges and requirements related to the integration of documentation practices in real-world data production scenarios. Our findings comprise important design considerations and highlight the value of designing data documentation based on the needs of data workers. We argue that a view of documentation as a boundary object, i.e., an object that can be used differently across organizations and teams but holds enough immutable content to maintain integrity, can be useful when designing documentation to retrieve heterogeneous, often distributed, contexts of data production.},

Group selfies, in particular, encourage people to represent their identity as part of the group and foster a sense of belonging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing systems are used as a tool for group selfies. However, conventional systems are not ideal for group selfies due to the rigidness of grid-based layout, information overload, and lack of eye contact. To explore design opportunities and needs for a novel virtual group selfie platform, we conducted a participatory design, and identified three characteristics of virtual group selfie scenarios, “context with narratives”, “interactive group tasks”, and “capturing subtle moments.” We implemented Virfie, a web-based platform that enables users to take group selfies with embodied social interaction, and to create and customize selfie scenarios using a novel JSON specification. In order to validate our design concept and identify usability issues we conducted a user study. Feedbacks from the study participants suggest that Virfie is effective at strengthening social interaction and remote togetherness.},

Through formative interviews with 11 active moderators from 10 different subreddits, we learned about the limitations of currently available automated tools, and how a new system could extend their capabilities. Developed out of these interviews, Crossmod makes its decisions based on cross-community learning---an approach that leverages a large corpus of previous moderator decisions via an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, we deployed Crossmod in a controlled environment, simulating real-time conversations from two large subreddits with over 10M subscribers each. To evaluate Crossmod's moderation recommendations, 4 moderators reviewed comments scored by Crossmod that had been drawn randomly from existing threads. Crossmod achieved an overall accuracy of 86% when detecting comments that would be removed by moderators, with high recall (over 87.5%). Additionally, moderators reported that they would have removed 95.3% of the comments flagged by Crossmod; however, 98.3% of these comments were still online at the time of this writing (i.e., not removed by the current moderation system). To the best of our knowledge, Crossmod is the first open source, AI-backed sociotechnical moderation system to be designed using participatory methods.},

abstract = {Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems that rely on natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly prevalent within people's everyday lives. From virtual assistants integrated into mobile devices (e.g. Apple's Siri), smart home assistants (e.g. Google's Nest; Amazon's Alexa/Echo), and vehicles (e.g. Apple's CarPlay; Android Auto); to software tasks such as automatic translation, automatic captioning, automatic subtitling and even hands-free computing, ASR systems are core components of IoT (Internet of things) devices and applications. However, scholars have begun to show that with these increasing innovations and system capabilities, emerges fairness-related harms of user experiences and racial disparities that negatively impact African American speakers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). As users of ASR, AAVE speakers’ language is less accurately recognized and processed, leading to inequitable interactions among this ethnolect community. My graduate research seeks to address this challenge by developing and validating community-collaborative methods to innovate responsible approaches toward designing more representative and equitable ASR language technologies that accommodate African American speakers of AAVE.},

However, it is important to understand how equity is conceptualized in practice. As a curated collection of methods, toolkits signal how equity is imagined in design. In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of 17 design toolkits related to equity. We explore alternative design approaches that address inequity in design. We evaluate whether equity toolkits align with calls for changes to design practice, as well as Nancy Fraser’s dimensions of justice. Finally, we find that design toolkits focus on the ‘digital divide’ rather than redistributing world-building power, and thus continue to keep design power with professional designers. We also find that ‘design thinking’ continues to influence design toolkits. Furthermore, the simplicity of toolkits does not engage with the complexities that shape equity in practice. We conclude with suggestions to help researchers and designers rethink design toolkits.},

To this end, we propose a novel AI agent with the goal of generating more human-like behavior. We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test, while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments. This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.},

To better understand children's awareness of online stranger danger and explore their visions for technologies that can help them manage related online risks (e.g., sexual solicitations and cyberbullying), we held two participatory design sessions with 12 children (ages 8-11 years old). We found that children desired varying levels of agency, depending on the severity of the risk. In most cases, they wanted help resolving the issue themselves instead of relying on their parents to do it for them. Children also believed that social media apps should take on more responsibility in promoting online safety for children. We discuss the children's desires for agency, privacy, and automated intelligent assistance and provide novel design recommendations inspired by children.},

The potential to foster new forms of multisensory interaction through various sensor, mobile and haptic technologies is promising in providing new ways for young children to engage with key mathematical concepts. However, designing effective learning environments for real world classrooms is challenging, and requires a pedagogically, rather than technologically, driven approach to design. This paper describes initial work underpinning the development of a pedagogical framework, intended to inform the design of a multisensory serious gaming environment. It identifies the theoretical basis of the framework, illustrates how this informs teaching strategies, and outlines key technology research driven perspectives and considerations important for informing design.

However, due to their virtual nature, a large and detailed amount data is available about in-game actions not currently accessible in traditional sport. This provides an opportunity to incorporate novel insights about complex aspects of gameplay into the audience experience – enabling more in-depth coverage for experienced viewers, and increased accessibility for newcomers. Previous research has only explored a limited range of ways data could be incorporated into esports viewing (e.g. data visualizations post-match) and only a few studies have investigated how the presentation of statistics impacts spectators’ experiences and viewing behaviors. We present Weavr, a companion app that allows audiences to consume data-driven insights during and around esports broadcasts. We report on deployments at two major tournaments, that provide ecologically valid findings about how the app’s features were experienced by audiences and their impact on viewing behavior. We discuss implications for the design of second-screen apps for live esports events, and for traditional sports as similar data becomes available for them via improved tracking technologies.},

abstract = {Formal methods is a field that has a long standing history within Computer Science. At its core, it involves the use of mathematical formalisms to model and reason about computer systems and programs. The application of formal methods to verify that railway signalling systems operate safely and correctly is particularly well established within academia and is now beginning to see real applications in the railway sector. However, many contemporary approaches frequently detect false positive safety violations necessitating lengthy manual analysis by expert engineers. It has been shown that such errors can be mitigated with strengthening invariants, non-trivially generated properties which hold for all reachable states, or configurations, of a program under verification. In this work, we report on the use of machine learning to explore such state spaces autonomously and provide various visual aids to assist engineers in understanding and inducing invariant properties to support verification. We conducted a focus group with an engineering team specialising in railway signalling systems, soliciting feedback on these visualisations while co-designing suggested improvements for the application domain. The results were two-fold; our visualisations allowed participants to explore candidate invariants, but also highlighted improvements to our machine learning approach by leveraging their domain knowledge.},

We conducted a participatory design study in which platform workers deconstructed and re-imagined Uber’s schema for driver data. We analyzed the data structures and social institutions participants proposed, focusing on the stakeholders, roles, and strategies for mitigating conflicting interests of privacy, personal agency, and utility. Using critical theory, we reflected on the capability of participatory design to generate bottom-up collective data infrastructures.

abstract = {Incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives is seen as an essential step towards enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) ethics. In this regard, the field of arts is perceived to play a key role in elucidating diverse historical and cultural narratives, serving as a bridge across research communities. Most of the works that examine the interplay between the field of arts and AI ethics concern digital artworks, largely exploring the potential of computational tools in being able to surface biases in AI systems. In this paper, we investigate a complementary direction–that of uncovering the unique socio-cultural perspectives embedded in human-made art, which in turn, can be valuable in expanding the horizon of AI ethics. Through semi-structured interviews across sixteen artists, art scholars, and researchers of diverse Indian art forms like music, sculpture, painting, floor drawings, dance, etc., we explore how non-Western ethical abstractions, methods of learning, and participatory practices observed in Indian arts, one of the most ancient yet perpetual and influential art traditions, can shed light on aspects related to ethical AI systems. Through a case study concerning the Indian dance system (i.e. the ‘Natyashastra’), we analyze potential pathways towards enhancing ethics in AI systems. Insights from our study outline the need for (1) incorporating empathy in ethical AI algorithms, (2) integrating multimodal data formats for ethical AI system design and development, (3) viewing AI ethics as a dynamic, diverse, cumulative, and shared process rather than as a static, self-contained framework to facilitate adaptability without annihilation of values (4) consistent life-long learning to enhance AI accountability},

The field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has begun to examine how the resultant sociotechnical systems may be designed appropriately when targeting underserved populations. We present an ethnographic study of a large-scale real-world integration of an AI system for resource allocation in a call-based maternal and child health program in India. Our findings uncover complexities around determining who benefits from the intervention, how the human-AI collaboration is managed, when intervention must take place in alignment with various priorities, and why the AI is sought, for what purpose. Our paper offers takeaways for human-centered AI integration in public health, drawing attention to the work done by the AI as actor, the work of configuring the human-AI partnership with multiple diverse stakeholders, and the work of aligning program goals for design and implementation through continual dialogue across stakeholders.},

abstract = {With the growing need to regulate AI systems across a wide variety of application domains, a new set of occupations has emerged in the industry. The so-called responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners or AI ethicists are generally tasked with interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safe design of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives. In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes to business leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educators with a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.},

abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Robots are being increasingly developed as social actors, entering public and personal spaces such as airports, shopping malls, care centres, and even homes, and using human or animal-like social techniques to work with people. Some even aim to engineer social situations, or are designed specifically for an emotional response (e.g., comforting a person). However, if we consider these robots as social interventions, then it is important to recognize that the robots design - its behavior, its application, its appearance, even its marketing image - will have an impact on the society and in the spaces it enters. While in some cases this may be a positive effect, social robots can also contribute negatively, e.g., reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting ageist views. This full-day workshop aims to offer a forum for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers to explore this issue, and to work toward potential opportunities for the field. Ultimately, we want to promote robots for social good that can contribute to positive social changes for socio-political issues (e.g., ageism, feminism, homelessness, environmental issues). The political aspects of technologies have long been scrutinized in related areas such as Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In particular, critical design explicitly targets the design of technologies that can contribute to our understanding of how technology can impact society. This workshop aims to strengthen this discussion in the HRI community, with the goal of working toward initial recommendations for how HRI designers can include elements of critical design in their work.},

Emerging research suggests that the opacity of the algorithm and platform policies often distract creators from their creative endeavors. To study how algorithmic platforms can be more ‘creator-friendly,’ we conducted a mixed-methods study: interviews (N=14) and a participatory design workshop (N=12) with YouTube creators. Through the interviews, we found how creators’ folk theories of the curation algorithm impact their work strategies — whether they choose to work with or against the algorithm — and the associated challenges in the process. In the workshop, creators explored solution ideas to overcome the aforementioned challenges, such as fostering diverse and creative expressions, achieving success as a creator, and motivating creators to continue their job. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities for how algorithmic platforms can support and motivate creators to sustain their creative work.},

abstract = {Ethical principles for algorithms are gaining importance as more and more stakeholders are affected by "high-risk" algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems. Understanding how these systems work enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and to assess the systems’ adherence to ethical values. Explanations are a promising way to create understanding, but current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research does not always consider existent theories on how understanding is formed and evaluated. In this work, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of understanding by conducting a qualitative task-based study with 30 participants, including users and affected stakeholders. We use three explanation modalities (textual, dialogue, and interactive) to explain a "high-risk" ADM system to participants and analyse their responses both inductively and deductively, using the "six facets of understanding" framework by Wiggins &amp; McTighe [63]. Our findings indicate that the "six facets" framework is a promising approach to analyse participants’ thought processes in understanding, providing categories for both rational and emotional understanding. We further introduce the "dialogue" modality as a valid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction with the "explainer", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the process. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding affects participants’ perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the interdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies have outlined. We posit that drawing from theories on learning and understanding like the "six facets" and leveraging explanation modalities can guide XAI research to better suit explanations to learning processes of individuals and consequently enable their assessment of ethical values of ADM systems.},

We provide an overview of recent developments of synchronous remote collaboration systems and create a taxonomy by dividing them into three main components that form such systems: Environment, Avatars, and Interaction. A thorough overview of existing systems is given, categorising their main contributions to help researchers working in different fields by providing concise information about specific topics such as avatars, virtual environment, visualisation styles, and interaction. The focus of this work is clearly on synchronised collaboration from a distance.

The aim of the presented research is to create a tool that both supports the decision-making process and helps multiple writers to collaborate in creating a game world. Constructing a layered hierarchical graph provides information about game plot description, while the proposed graph generation system based on JSON data format allows designers and story writers to create game worlds. A key feature of the graph generation system is that it describes game worlds using a sequence of generation rules which represent the player's actions. On the one hand, the proposed approach helps the story writers to control the impact of the created story elements on the game world. On the other hand, it allows world designers to use procedural generation of narration chains, analyze and test the designed game plots. An additional goal of this approach strongly focused on using the JSON data format to describe actions that can be taken in world states is the impact of JSON data structures on the application of graph rules, which may be important in the problems of artificial intelligence.},

The study is motivated by a relative lack of focus on user safety in social matching systems (Tinder, Bumble, etc.) in light of advances to user discovery mechanisms that enable increasingly rapid face-to-face encounters. Findings highlight ways that social matching systems could support users’ safety after they have left home to pursue a social opportunity in the physical world. Co-designers envisioned a social matching system acting as a “guardian” that genuinely cares for, and monitors, the user's safety even if it cannot flawlessly mitigate harm. Rather than respond only after a definitive harm has occurred, co-designers expected the system to intervene earlier, during ambiguously unsafe or uncomfortable situations. The paper considers directions for future work in response to users’ expectations for how social matching systems should coordinate with trusted contacts to intervene in unsafe situations.},

In contrast, features that would improve the community feeling or would help to improve ideas of others were not often suggested or selected. Nonetheless, the experience was rated as quite enjoyable by players, showing the appeal of such a player-driven game design approach and the relevancy for further research in this context.},

abstract = {Co-design research with children is a field that continues to find new ground and expand as it explores new, and more effective ways to design. As children become more enveloped in a world of technology and video games, it follows to leverage these kinds of experiences for use in our design toolbox. In addition, continuing to explore how to include a larger global audience through distributed co-design can advance the design process. The study presented in this paper serves as a preliminary exploration of virtual sandbox game environments as a co-design tool. Utilizing a design inclusive research approach, we discuss what led us to explore this environment as a co-design tool, how it evolved over time, and our success in using it to include those who could not attend in-person sessions.},

abstract = {This survey article assesses and compares existing critiques of current fairness-enhancing technical interventions in machine learning (ML) that draw from a range of non-computing disciplines, including philosophy, feminist studies, critical race and ethnic studies, legal studies, anthropology, and science and technology studies. It bridges epistemic divides in order to offer an interdisciplinary understanding of the possibilities and limits of hegemonic computational approaches to ML fairness for producing just outcomes for society’s most marginalized. The article is organized according to nine major themes of critique wherein these different fields intersect: 1) how "fairness" in AI fairness research gets defined; 2) how problems for AI systems to address get formulated; 3) the impacts of abstraction on how AI tools function and its propensity to lead to technological solutionism; 4) how racial classification operates within AI fairness research; 5) the use of AI fairness measures to avoid regulation and engage in ethics washing; 6) an absence of participatory design and democratic deliberation in AI fairness considerations; 7) data collection practices that entrench “bias,” are non-consensual, and lack transparency; 8) the predatory inclusion of marginalized groups into AI systems; and 9) a lack of engagement with AI’s long-term social and ethical outcomes. Drawing from these critiques, the article concludes by imagining future ML fairness research directions that actively disrupt entrenched power dynamics and structural injustices in society.},

abstract = {One of the most difficult aspects of the present COVID19 pandemic is early identification and diagnosis of COVID19, as well as exact segregation of non-COVID19 individuals at low cost and the sickness is in its early stages. Despite their widespread use in diagnostic centres, diagnostic approaches based solely on radiological imaging have flaws given the disease's novelty. As a result, to evaluate radiological pictures, healthcare practitioners and computer scientists frequently use machine learning and deep learning models. Based on a search strategy, from November 2019 to July 2020, researchers scanned the three different databases of Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for this study. Machine learning and deep learning are well-established artificial intelligence domains for data mining, analysis, and pattern recognition. Deep learning in which data is passed through many layers and automatically learning the composition of each layer from large dataset and it enables a new way that evaluates the complete image without human guidance to discern which insights are valuable, with applications ranging from object detection to medical image. Deep learning with CNN may have a significant effect on the automatic recognition and extraction of crucial features from X-ray and CT Scan images related to Covid19 analysis. According to the results, models based on deep learning possess amazing abilities to offer a precise and systematic system for detecting and diagnosing COVID19. In the field of COVID19 radiological imaging, deep learning software decreases false positive and false negative errors in the identification and diagnosis of the disease. It is providing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide patients with quick, inexpensive, and safe diagnostic services while also reducing the epidemic's impact on nursing and medical staff.},

With our study, we tried to get an insight into the everyday care work and to better understand the attitudes of caregivers towards the use of technology in elderly care, especially with a focus on artificial intelligence. In our paper, we present the results from a contextual inquiry, interviews, and a workshop for this purpose.},

abstract = {From initial case-reporting at the crime scene to finishing legal procedures, survivors of sexual assault navigate numerous human and technological resources provided by various organizations. During the help-seeking process, survivors unavoidably interact with multiple professional stakeholders (e.g., legal authorities) and technologies (e.g., checking their case status on a court website). In the long and complex process, survivors experience interactional breakdowns with technology, and/or humans, but few studies have explored what types of breakdowns systematically occur and how to resolve them. Thus, for this study, we conducted in-depth interviews with survivors and professionals who reside in South Korea to identify what and how breakdowns occur. Moreover, participatory design sessions were conducted with sexual assault survivors and professionals to create designs that could resolve the breakdowns. Consequently, we discovered a total of eleven breakdowns and produced solutions centered on the stakeholders (i.e., survivor and professionals). Specifically, our participants wanted an integrated system that proactively informs survivors of the holistic procedures for help-seeking and legal action, manages their case, and even interacts with legal authorities on the survivor's behalf. Based on the findings, we provide an agenda of essential designs and features that could mitigate interactional breakdowns. Additionally, we call for the HCI community to approach and solve sexual violence problems through a broad, macroscopic perspective instead of focusing on one specific technology or (social or organizational) system.},

Our Video Calling for Autism prototype provided an Expressiveness Mirror that gave feedback to autistic people on how their facial expressions might be interpreted by their neurotypical conversation partners. This feedback was in the form of emojis representing six emotions and a bar indicating the amount of overall expressiveness demonstrated by the user. However, when we built a working prototype and conducted a user study with autistic participants, their negative feedback caused us to reconsider how our design process led to a prototype that they did not find useful. We reflect on the design challenges around developing AI technology for an autistic user population, how Wizard of Oz prototypes can be overly optimistic in representing AI-driven prototypes, how autistic research participants can respond differently to user experience prototypes of varying fidelity, and how designing for people with diverse abilities needs to include that population in the development process.},

This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Our results of an elicitation study with professional translators indicate that a combination of pen, touch, and speech could well support common PE tasks, and received high subjective ratings by our participants. Therefore, we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other hand, eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected during PE.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become a crucial component in software products, either as part of the user experience or used internally by software teams. Prior studies have explored how ML is affecting development team roles beyond data scientists, including user experience designers, program managers, developers and operations engineers. However, there has been little investigation of how team members in different roles on the team communicate about ML, in particular about the quality of models. We use the general term quality to look beyond technical issues of model evaluation, such as accuracy and overfitting, to any issue affecting whether a model is suitable for use, including ethical, engineering, operations, and legal considerations. What challenges do teams face in discussing the quality of ML models? What work practices mitigate those challenges? To address these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods study at a large software company, first interviewing15 employees in a variety of roles, then surveying 168 employees to broaden our understanding. We found several challenges, including a mismatch between user-focused and model-focused notions of performance, misunderstandings about the capabilities and limitations of evolving ML technology, and difficulties in understanding concerns beyond one's own role. We found several mitigation strategies, including the use of demos during discussions to keep the team customer-focused.},

The two primary goals of the project were to create design abstractions that integrate recent advances in graphical interaction techniques and to explicitly support specific patterns of use of Petri nets in real-world settings.Using a participatory design process, we organized a series of video-based design activities that helped us manage the tension between finding useful design abstractions and specifying the details of the user interface. Video artifacts resulting from one activity became the basis for the next, facilitating communication among members of the multi-disciplinary design team. The video artifacts provided an efficient way of capturing and incorporating subtle aspects of Petri Nets In Use into our design and ensured that the implementation of our design principles was grounded in real-world work practices.},

In this paper, we develop a generalizable chatbot architecture (CASS) to provide social support for community members in an online health community. The CASS architecture is based on advanced neural network algorithms, thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety of responses to them. CASS is also generalizable as it can be easily migrate to other online communities. With a follow-up field experiment, CASS is proven useful in supporting individual members who seek emotional support. Our work also contributes to fill the research gap on how a chatbot may influence the whole community's engagement.},

Within the now extensive FAccT literature, transparency has largely been understood in terms of explainability. While this approach has proven helpful in many contexts, it falls short of addressing some of the more fundamental issues in the development and application of machine learning, such as the epistemic limitations of predictions and the political nature of the selection of fairness criteria. In order to render machine learning systems more democratic, we argue, a broader understanding of transparency is needed. We therefore propose to view transparency as a communicative constellation that is a precondition for meaningful democratic deliberation. We discuss four perspective expansions implied by this approach and present a case study illustrating the interplay of heterogeneous actors involved in producing this constellation. Drawing from our conceptualization of transparency, we sketch implications for actor groups in different sectors of society.},

However, this is not yet commonplace in Learning Analytics (LA). Co-design techniques from other domains therefore have much to offer to LA, in principle, but there are few detailed accounts of exactly how such sessions unfold. This paper presents the rationale driving a card-based co-design tool specifically tuned for LA, called LA-DECK. In the context of a pilot study with students, educators, LA researchers and developers, we provide qualitative and quantitative accounts of how participants used the cards. Using three different forms of analysis (transcript-centric design vignettes, card-graphs and time-on-topic), we characterise in what ways the sessions were "participatory" in nature, and argue that the cards succeeded in playing very similar roles to those documented in the literature on successful card-based design tools.},

These powerful tools can answer complex questions and, surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this paper, we present a collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task---the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely.},

abstract = {Recent advances in technology and reduction in hardware costs have made the collection of acoustic environmental recordings more accessible, thereby facilitating easier acquisition of biodiversity data for monitoring, research and conservation. Despite these advances, and the growing power of machine learning and automated techniques to process acoustic data, there exists a lack of tools to facilitate accessible visualisation and exploration of long-duration acoustic recordings collected in the field. Additionally, the exclusion of forest communities and traditional beliefs and practices in tropical forest conservation, originating from colonialism and continuing through neocolonial approaches, often results in tension between conservation practitioners, projects, and forest communities. While there has been a proliferation of citizen science projects, tools and applications arising from ecoacoustics research, there is a need to respond to calls, from other citizen science domains, for this work to engage with “citizens" outside the role of ‘data collector’, towards more co-creative citizen science. Through the lens of participatory design, my research attends to both issues by developing alternative methods of data visualisation that enable more accessible analysis and exploration of big ecoacoustics data, while attending to questions of conservation data justice and participation in forest fringe settings.},

However, there are pitfalls along this path, which introduce heterogeneity in the gathered data, and which are rooted in the diversity of the involved device platforms, hardware, software versions and participants. Thus, we, as a research community, need to establish good practices and methodologies for addressing this issue in order to help ensure that, e.g., scientific results and policy changes based on collective, mobile sensed data are valid. In this paper, we aim to inform researchers and developers about mobile sensing data heterogeneity and ways to combat it. We do so via distilling a vocabulary of underlying causes, and via describing their effects on mobile sensing---building on experiences from three projects within citizen science, crowd awareness and trajectory tracking.},

abstract = {As robots are starting to inhabit more intimate social spheres, their functionality and acceptance in a fundamentally social environment greatly depend on them being tolerated by humans. One factor contributing to successfully accomplishing tasks in a collaborative manner is how robots' actions and motions are interpreted by the people around them. Our broader research seeks to explore this gap aiming to design movement that is expressive, culturally dependent and contextually sensitive. A country that is at the forefront of this, in terms of social robots and their acceptance in society, is Japan. Therefore, as the first phases of this broader research, we present a new process, including a design toolkit, an open brief and a participatory structure. We discuss the resulting robot morphologies and participant feedback from a workshop in Japan, and conclude by discussing limitations and further research in designing robots with expressive movement, contextually sensitive within an HRI-for-all paradigm.},

This study explores the challenges faced by conversational UX designers working in multidisciplinary teams for understanding the design process involved in the transformation of conventional graphical interfaces to conversation flows. In-depth interviews with UX designers working in industries reveal the key challenges in the form-to-flow transformation process. Moreover, collaborative work with various stakeholders in complex work environments involves conversational artificial intelligence-engendered gap-filling work phenomena wherein UX designers tend to work across role boundaries. Our results indicate the need for added support for CUX designer including tools and guidelines to suppport form-to-flow design, tools for testing, and defining extended roles for CUX designers with collaborative perspectives for designing conversational agents in multi-channel service environments.},

Twenty two young participants played the mirror game with the robotic arm, where one player (person or robot) follows the movements of the other. The robotic arm performed a set of sharp and smooth movements, which the participants were asked to rate. The greatest preference was given to smooth movements. Half of the participants preferred to lead, and half to follow. Our results highlight the importance of personalized human-robot interactions.},

However, the exploration of such technologies entails the development of an understanding of how they may increase and/or counter marginalization. The use of AI/ML algorithms can lead to several challenges, such as privacy and security concerns, biases, unfairness, and lack of cultural awareness, which especially affect marginalized people. This workshop will provide a forum to share experiences and challenges of developing AI/ML health and social wellbeing technologies with/for marginalized people and will work towards developing design methods to engage in the re-envisioning of AI/ML technologies for and with marginalized people. In doing so we will create cross-research area dialogues and collaborations. These discussions build a basis to (1) explore potential tools to support designing AI/ML systems with marginalized people, and (2) develop a design agenda for future research and AI/ML technology for and with marginalized people.},

Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. It is time to convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

Despite the long-standing and growing need for collaboration with CAD models and tools, anecdotal reports and ongoing researcher efforts point to a complex and unresolved set of challenges faced by designers when working with distributed CAD. We aim to close this academic-practitioner knowledge gap through the first systematic study of professional user-driven CAD collaboration challenges. In this work, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 CAD professionals of diverse industries, roles, and experience levels to understand their collaborative workflows with distributed CAD tools. In total, we identify 14 challenges related to collaborative design, communication, data management, and permissioning that are currently impeding effective collaboration in professional CAD teams. Our systematic classification of CAD collaboration challenges presents a guide for pressing areas of future work, highlighting important implications for CAD researchers, practitioners, and tool builders to target new advancement in CAD infrastructure, management choices, and modelling best practices. With the insights gained from this work, we hope to ultimately improve collaboration efficiency, quality, and innovation for future product design teams.},

However, these systems have come under increasing criticism in recent years for prioritizing technical disciplines over insights from the humanities and social science and failing to adequately incorporate the perspectives of at-risk or affected communities. This paper describes a unique month-long workshop that convened interdisciplinary experts to collaborate on projects related to flood data. In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions. First, we position interdisciplinarity as a critical practice and offer a detailed example of how we staged this process. We then discuss the benefits to interdisciplinarity of expanding the range of temporal logics normally deployed in design workshops. Finally, we reflect on approaches to evaluating the event's contributions toward sustained critique and reform of expert practice.},

Despite these contributions, the technology can also create biases and discrimination in communities and among other risks. So far, the literature is focused on the technology level addressing performance efficiency and process improvement. In contrast, the literature lacks a comprehensive approach for planning AI projects and use case identification for government and public service delivery. The core question addressed in this paper is what factors should be considered when determining AI-related problems and establishing viable use cases. To address this question, the paper critically reviews existing approaches using the Context, Content, and Process (CCP) framework to identify problems and formulate AI use cases. Findings from the review rationalise the research gap and propose preliminary components that are significant in planning AI projects for the government.},

We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs’ potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.},

abstract = {Smart home systems contain plenty of features that enhance wellbeing in everyday life through artificial intelligence (AI). However, many users feel insecure because they do not understand the AI’s functionality and do not feel they are in control of it. Combining technical, psychological and philosophical views on AI, we rethink smart homes as interactive systems where users can partake in an intelligent agent’s learning. Parallel to the goals of explainable AI (XAI), we explored the possibility of user involvement in supervised learning of the smart home to have a first approach to improve acceptance, support subjective understanding and increase perceived control. In this work, we conducted two studies: In an online pre-study, we asked participants about their attitude towards teaching AI via a questionnaire. In the main study, we performed a Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with human participants, where participants spent time in a prototypical smart home and taught activity recognition to the intelligent agent through supervised learning based on the user’s behaviour. We found that involvement in the AI’s learning phase enhanced the users’ feeling of control, perceived understanding and perceived usefulness of AI in general. The participants reported positive attitudes towards training a smart home AI and found the process understandable and controllable. We suggest that involving the user in the learning phase could lead to better personalisation and increased understanding and control by users of intelligent agents for smart home automation.},

However, context and embodiment are relevant to moral decision-making. Due to the potential to immerse participants in a simulated environment, purpose-built games and scenarios might prove valuable as empirical tools. As a case study of gamifying bioethics, we describe the co-design and implementation of "What Lies Ahead?", a digital role-play scenario for research with adolescents. "What Lies Ahead?" engages young people with ethical issues related to predictive technologies in psychiatry. As preliminary evidence of the validity of this gamified approach, we report qualitative results suggesting that the role-play was immersive, and elicited authentic responses and reflective thinking in adolescent participants. Even though application of game-play mechanics is rare in bioethics, we find digital role-play to be a powerful tool that collects data through real-time, realistic scenarios.},

I also identify localization and translation practices as areas where indigenous epistemologies are often undermined. Against this backdrop, by employing indigenous-centered approaches, such as the integrative approach, third space, Afrikology and predominantly indigenous methodologies, TPC and UX researchers can address cultural nuances and design needs, ensuring respectful and effective communication. Furthermore, I propose the focused life-story interview method rooted in indigenous research paradigm as a means of exploring sensitive topics and fostering meaningful connections with participants. I conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to apply indigenous methodologies to ethically design artificial intelligence (AI) systems.},

abstract = {AI assistants that use a voice user interface (VUI), such as AI speakers, have become popular in family homes. However, it is still unclear what roles the AI speaker can support within the family unit. We investigated the roles of an AI speaker as a family-shared technology. By conducting a one-week participatory user study, we discovered that family members' co-ownership toward the AI speaker was the key in the development of its family-oriented roles. Our findings showed seven domains of user expectations on these roles, and we realized that all the expectations can be represented as family cohesion. In addition, privacy awareness was emphasized regarding personal supports. Finally, we discuss a new perspective for AI speaker design and offer two suggestions: 1) leveraging human-likeness to develop its potential roles of supporting the unit of a family and 2) interpreting the home context to seamlessly connect family and personal supporting roles.},

abstract = {The promise AI’s proponents have made for decades is one in which our needs are predicted, anticipated, and met - often before we even realize it. Instead, algorithmic systems, particularly AIs trained on large datasets and deployed to massive scales, seem to keep making the wrong decisions, causing harm and rewarding absurd outcomes. Attempts to make sense of why AIs make wrong calls in the moment explain the instances of errors, but how the environment surrounding these systems precipitate those instances remains murky. This paper draws from anthropological work on bureaucracies, states, and power, translating these ideas into a theory describing the structural tendency for powerful algorithmic systems to cause tremendous harm. I show how administrative models and projections of the world create marginalization, just as algorithmic models cause representational and allocative harm. This paper concludes with a recommendation to avoid the absurdity algorithmic systems produce by denying them power.},

abstract = {Designing for children with ADHD has been of increasing interest to the HCI community. However, current approaches do not adequately involve all relevant stakeholders, and primarily focus on addressing symptoms, following a medical model of disability that is extrinsic to neurodivergent interests. To address this, we employed a multi-step, multi-stakeholder approach (N=31). First, we conducted 1) interviews with children with ADHD and their care ecosystem followed by 2) a co-design pilot with one child with ADHD and his therapists and an interview with a UX designer and an occupational therapist. We then employed 3) co-design sessions with neurotypical children and children with ADHD, and 4) a focus group with their therapists. We identified communication and reflection as key concepts for empowering and promoting the well-being of children with ADHD and their care ecosystem. We contribute design implications for future systems aiming to promote the overall well-being of this population.},

abstract = {Delivering a presentation has been reported as one of the most anxiety-provoking tasks faced by English Language Learners. Researchers suggest that instructors should be more aware of the learners' emotional states to provide appropriate emotional and instructional scaffolding to improve their performance when presenting. Despite the critical role of instructors in perceiving the emotional states among English language learners, it can be challenging to do this solely by observing the learners? facial expressions, behaviors, and their limited verbal expressions due to language and cultural barriers. To address the ambiguity and inconsistency in interpreting the emotional states of the students, this research focuses on identifying the potential of using biosensor-based feedback of learners to support instructors. A novel approach has been adopted to classify the intensity and characteristics of public speaking anxiety and foreign language anxiety among English language learners and to provide tailored feedback to instructors while supporting teaching and learning. As part of this work, two further studies were proposed. The first study was designed to identify educators' needs for solutions providing emotional and instructional support. The second study aims to evaluate a resulting prototype as a view of instructors to offer tailored emotional and instructional scaffolding to students. The contribution of these studies includes the development of guidance in using biosensor-based feedback that will assist English language instructors in teaching and identifying the students' anxiety levels and types while delivering a presentation.},

In this study, we explored how VCAs could encourage adolescents with ASD in navigating various aspects of their daily lives through the two-week use of VCAs and a series of participatory design workshops. Our findings demonstrated that VCAs could be an engaging, empowering, emancipating tool that supports adolescents with ASD to address their needs, personalities, and expectations, such as promoting self-care skills, regulating negative emotions, and practicing conversational skills. We propose implications of using off-the-shelf technologies as a personal assistant to ASD users in Assistive Technology design. We suggest design implications for promoting positive opportunities while mitigating the remaining challenges of VCAs for adolescents with ASD.},

abstract = {Administrative processes are ubiquitous in modern life and have been identified as a particular burden to those with accessibility needs. Students who have accessibility needs often have to understand guidance, fill in complex forms, and communicate with multiple parties to disclose disabilities and access appropriate support. Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) could allow us to reimagine such processes, yet there is currently limited understanding of how to design these to be accessible, or whether such an approach would be preferred. In the ADMINS (Assistants for the Disclosure and Management of Information about Needs and Support) project, we implemented a virtual assistant (VA) which is designed to enable students to disclose disabilities and to provide guidance and suggestions about appropriate support. ADMINS explores the potential of CUIs to reduce administrative burden and improve the experience of arranging support by replacing a static form with written or spoken dialogue. This article reports the results of two trials conducted during the project. A beta trial using an early version of the VA provided understanding of accessibility challenges and issues in user experience. The beta trial sample included 22 students who had already disclosed disabilities and 3 disability support advisors. After improvements to the design, a larger main trial was conducted with 134 students who disclosed their disabilities to the university using both the VA and the existing form-based process. The results show that the VA was preferred by most participants to completing the form (64.9% vs 23.9%). Qualitative and quantitative feedback from the trials also identified accessibility and user experience barriers for improving CUI design, and an understanding of benefits and preferences that can inform further development of accessible CUIs for this design space.},

abstract = {During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establishcommon ground ---a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs. Our study involved two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner that used a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study during which the autistic participants designed a game intended to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics. We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information. This project generated insights related to two distinct aspects of designing assistive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support autistic individuals: (1) the ability for visual elicitation activities to help autistic individuals recognize interaction patterns, gain a deeper understanding of other's perspectives, and imagine more desirable alternatives, and (2) the importance of recognizing and supporting multi-dimensional aspects of communication practices (i.e., social, emotional, sensory) in establishing and maintaining shared points of reference for neurodiverse conversation dyads.},

abstract = {The AI Ethics community faces an imperative to empower stakeholders and impacted community members so that they can scrutinize and influence the design, development, and use of AI systems in high-stakes domains. While a growing chorus of recent papers has kindled interest in so-called “participatory ML” methods, precisely what form participation ought to take and how to operationalize these ambitions are seldom addressed. Our survey of the relevant literature shows that in many papers, participation is reduced to highly structured, computational mechanisms designed to elicit mathematically tractable approximations of narrowly-defined moral values. Of papers that actually engage with real people, these engagements typically consist of one-time interactions with individuals that are often unrepresentative of the relevant stakeholders. Motivated by these clear limitations, we introduce a consolidated set of axes to evaluate and improve participatory approaches. We use these axes to analyze contemporary work in this space and outline future AI research directions that could meaningfully contribute to operationalizing the ideal of participation.},

This methodology was applied in a project for designing game concepts for and with senior citizens. The research started off by observing and probing senior citizens in their 'natural habitat', researching what positive experiences occur in their daily life. These observed passions then became the input for brainstorm sessions. Seniors and researchers generated game-ideas and, consequently, co-designed the selected ideas into game concepts.The results of this methodology are inspiring game concepts, directly grafted on the passions and desires of the senior. But more important than the actual game concepts, we conceived a model of passions in elderly life. This model provides game designers with an understanding of the ingredients that are fundamental to 'meaningful play' in elderly life.},

This company has an advanced computer network infrastructure for communication and information sharing, but the primary task of the employees at the petrol stations is serving customers. We identify some challenges to introducing E-learning in this kind of environment. A primary emphasis has been on using participatory design techniques in the planning and early implementation phases of a system prototype. The system development process was evolutionary, starting bottom-up (user participation) and ending top-down (centralized initiatives). We describe a conceptual framework for analyzing the adoption process. The framework has three dimensions: technology, pedagogy and organization. We use video recordings and interview data in the analysis. Preliminary findings indicate difficulties with respect to appropriateness of new technology and lateral cooperation. This paper provides insight into the successful co-existence of old and new technologies and multiple information seeking strategies.},

abstract = {Current cloud deletion mechanisms fall short in meeting users’ various deletion needs. They assume all data is deleted the same way—data is temporally removed (or hidden) from users’ cloud accounts before being completely deleted. This assumption neglects users’ desire to have data completely deleted instantly or their preference to have it recoverable for a more extended period. To date, these preferences have not been explored. To address this gap, we conducted a participatory study with four groups of active cloud users (five subjects per group). We examined their deletion preferences and the information they require to aid deletion. In particular, we explored how users want to delete cloud data and identify what information about cloud deletion they consider essential, the time it should be made available to them, and the communication channel that should be used. We show that cloud deletion preferences are complex and multi-dimensional, varying between subjects and groups. Information about deletion should be within reach when needed, for instance, be part of deletion controls. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of our study in improving the current deletion mechanism to accommodate these preferences.},

abstract = {Video and transcripts of two architectural design meetings are presented in an analysis of a specific design process. The focus of the analysis presented here is the social and cultural aspects of cognition in design. The argument begins with a discussion of the parallels in design studies and cognitive science as each begun to consider the importance of environmental influences in how we design and how we think. By applying three situated frameworks to understand the situated nature of design meetings, the analysis shows that notions of social creation and cultural cognition are complimentary and necessary when trying to understand how the design process works.},

abstract = {Data science has become more and more powerful as the development of algorithms and computing power has made huge progresses. Researchers have used machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to solve hard problems in a variety of domains. Nevertheless, data science will only show its true potential the moment that all categories of interested parties (not only specialist data scientists) will be capable of understanding and interacting with data.This work, hence, is not about data science in a classical way, but about exploring the data-human interface that may be possible to establish utilizing available tools, with little or no background knowledge of how a data science pipeline works.In this paper we show how, within a Sports Science degree course, where no specific knowledge regarding algorithms, statistics or data science is acquired, it was possible to obtain significant results in relation to a data analysis problem, using off-the-shelf application packages. In particular, we here show how, without any specific customization, it has been possible to employ the machine and deep learning algorithms offered by the publicly available platforms, to solve a fitness exercise classification problem, obtaining performances that would have been deemed remarkable until not long ago.},

abstract = {Recently, the AI/ML research community has indicated an urgent need to establish Responsible AI (RAI) values and practices as part of the AI/ML lifecycle. Several organizations and communities are responding to this call by sharing RAI guidelines. However, there are gaps in awareness, deliberation, and execution of such practices for multi-disciplinary ML practitioners. This work contributes to the discussion by unpacking co-production challenges faced by practitioners as they align their RAI values. We interviewed 23 individuals, across 10 organizations, tasked to ship AI/ML based products while upholding RAI norms and found that both top-down and bottom-up institutional structures create burden for different roles preventing them from upholding RAI values, a challenge that is further exacerbated when executing conflicted values. We share multiple value levers used as strategies by the practitioners to resolve their challenges. We end our paper with recommendations for inclusive and equitable RAI value-practices, creating supportive organizational structures and opportunities to further aid practitioners.},

Little is currently known about what children think and want for overcoming errors. In this paper we report on design-for-error workshops with children (age 5-10) in which we staged 3 simulated errors with a health assessment technology. In our developmentally-sensitive study, children witnessed the errors via a puppet show and created low-fidelity models of recovery mechanisms using familiar 'play-things'. We found the children were able to grasp the representational nature of the task. Their ideas were playful and inspired by magical thinking. Their work forced us to reflect on and revisit our own design assumptions. The tasks have had a direct impact on the design of the assessment.},

In this paper, we introduce ”Virtepex”, an immersive exergame for remote strength assessment developed through participatory design principles. We bring out the design process starting with a needs assessment to highlight the challenges for physicians in telehealth, followed by the expert guidelines for iterative system refinement. Virtepex addresses the challenges for remote strength assessment through a marker-less and an easy-to-setup strength estimation pipeline. It utilizes an RGB-D camera for motion tracking and an inverse dynamics module for force estimation. The force estimates are used for VR object interaction and can be assessed by a physician synchronously or asynchronously for an objective evaluation. Validation by external experts shows that Virtepex produces reliable force estimates for upper body joints, indicating the potential of marker-less force estimation for future remote assessment designs.},

The study is motivated by gender disparities in harm through online dating, and the relative absence of dating app designs that prioritize women. Findings show that women are receptive to the notion of AI that augments their existing strategies for assessing risk of harm with meeting a particular user face-to-face. They outline various physical and non-physical harms that they attempt to reduce uncertainty about, and a range of data points as indicators of risk that could serve as the basis for a risk awareness AI model. Due to subjectivity in what is considered an indicator of risk, current findings suggest that risk awareness AI, if implemented, should allow women to train their own models.},

In this paper, through an interview study, we attempt to understand how chatbots can be better designed for Black American communities within the context of COVID-19. Along with the interviews, we performed design activities with 18 Black Americans that allowed them to envision and design their own chatbot to address their needs and challenges during the pandemic. We report our findings on our participants’ needs for chatbots’ roles and features, and their challenges in using chatbots. We then present design implications for future chatbot design for the Black American population.},

Specifically, many video streaming technologies require input devices and content browsers that are inaccessible to individuals with sensory and physical impairments and do not work with their current assistive technologies. Our team of engineers, designers, and clinicians took an inclusive approach to assessing and redesigning these streaming service products, with the aim of creating more universally accessible experiences. We recruited 9 participants with diverse abilities to evaluate the accessibility of a large telecommunication company's commercially available video streaming products. This evaluation revealed significant accessibility barriers and informed the design of a participatory design activity to create accessible remote-controls, an onboarding assistance prototype, and a content browsing prototype that is screen reader accessible and supports audio descriptions. We evaluated these accessible prototypes with 11 additional participants and found they were more accessible, flexible, and enjoyable to use compared to the off-the shelf products. In this paper we summarize these findings and discuss how future streaming technology must support customization and follow established accessibility guidelines and standards.},

abstract = {As more children's technologies are designed to be used with a global audience, new tools need to be created to include more children's voices in the design process. However, working with those children who are geographically distributed as design partners is difficult because existing technologies either do not support distributed design, or are not child-friendly. Industries that produce items for children to consume have begun using traditionally academic co-design techniques in order to design new products and experiences for children. As these groups need to reach out to more diverse and global populations, they will begin using technologies that support distributed co-design. As child-computer interaction researchers, we have a duty to understand this concept and identify recommendations for others to use that incorporate the ideals of our field. In order to do this, this paper describes the design process of an online environment to support geographically distributed, intergenerational co-design. Within this environment, children can work together despite differences of time zones, geographic location, or availability. The online environment was deployed for eight weeks during the summer and was modified each week throughout that time to better support the participants. Based on the experiences of participants within the environment, we make suggestions for new technologies including user management tools, creative expression tools, and ad hoc team membership that encourage more voices in the design process.},

The ubiquity of such technologies raises a host of ethical questions, value clashes, and unforeseen consequences that must be confronted. Developments such as Ai-Da and DALL-E 2 are exciting in that they present robust new capabilities in AI and creativity. However, the futures such technologies unlock are also unpredictable. Given the speed with which such technologies are emerging and becoming adopted, the need to engage target audiences to weigh in on possible AI futures is critical. Our pilot project, Artistic Process Futures and AI, seeks to explore the role and potential implications of AI technologies with artists. In this paper, we show how participatory speculative design processes might be channeled into a public statement, or manifesto, regarding possible and preferable AI futures for supporting the artistic process, and how our workshop exposed uncertainty at the core of such deliberation.},

abstract = {With the development of service-oriented computing environments, more and more Web services have become available. Service providers have to consider how to design composite services to meet requirements from various users. However, QoS of composite service is difficult to evaluate and predict due to the uncertainty and multiple metrics of QoS, which makes it necessary for user-centered design of composite services. Moreover, combining human services and Web services is becoming an important issue in service composition in cases that Web services cannot meet the requirements from users. Therefore, it is necessary to test the service composition environments for human-computer interaction and study human behaviors. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a participatory service design approach based on user-centered QoS considering a real-world case of field-based multi-language communication service design. To achieve this goal, we first describe the QoS model for service design considering users' requirements. Then, we propose the participatory service design process, consisting of service model refinement, participatory simulation, QoS evaluation and QoS data update. Finally, we use the field study of multi-language service design for Vietnamese agricultural knowledge communication to illustrate our proposed design methodology.},

abstract = {Technology companies continue to invest in efforts to incorporate responsibility in their Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, while efforts to audit and regulate AI systems expand. This shift towards Responsible AI (RAI) in the tech industry necessitates new practices and adaptations to roles—undertaken by a variety of practitioners in more or less formal positions, many of whom focus on the user-centered aspects of AI. To better understand practices at the intersection of user experience (UX) and RAI, we conducted an interview study with industrial UX practitioners and RAI subject matter experts, both of whom are actively involved in addressing RAI concerns throughout the early design and development of new AI-based prototypes, demos, and products, at a large technology company. Many of the specific practices and their associated challenges have yet to be surfaced in the literature, and distilling them offers a critical view into how practitioners’ roles are adapting to meet present-day RAI challenges. We present and discuss three emerging practices in which RAI is being enacted and reified in UX practitioners’ everyday work. We conclude by arguing that the emerging practices, goals, and types of expertise that surfaced in our study point to an evolution in praxis, with associated challenges that suggest important areas for further research in HCI.},

abstract = {The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design.This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO’s utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.},

The present research examined how accurately three different machine-learning algorithms could automatically classify users’ domain expertise based on signal features of their writing, without any content analysis. Compared with an unguided machine-learning classification accuracy of 71%, hybrid methods using empirical-statistical guidance correctly classified 79–92% of students by their domain expertise level. In addition to improved accuracy, the hybrid approach contributed a causal understanding of prediction success and generalization to new data. These novel findings open up opportunities to design new automated learning analytic systems and student-adaptive educational technologies for the rapidly expanding sector of commercial pen systems.},

Interactive applications of such agents, termed AI clones, pose risks related to impression management, identity abuse, and unhealthy dependencies. Identifying concerns AI clones will generate is a prerequisite to establishing the basis of discourse around how this technology will impact a source individual's selfhood and interpersonal relationships. We presented 20 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds with 8 speculative scenarios to explore their perception towards the concept of AI clones. We found that (1. doppelganger-phobia) the abusive potential of AI clones to exploit and displace the identity of an individual elicits negative emotional reactions; (2. identity fragmentation) creating replicas of a living individual threatens their cohesive self-perception and unique individuality; and (3. living memories) interacting with a clone of someone with whom the user has an existing relationship poses risks of misrepresenting the individual or developing over-attachment to the clone. These findings provide an avenue to discuss preliminary ethical implications, respect for identity and authenticity, and design recommendations for creating AI clones.},

Yet, it is often underused due to a lack of visualization skills and time needed to sketch and detail. Current visual co-creation tools can support this with existing images, whereas generative AI can produce entirely new images from textual prompts, allowing for highly specific, personalized results. In this paper, we explore how AI image generation can be used to enhance inspiration and communication throughout collaborative design. We introduce BrainFax, a tool that facilitates generating, editing, and sharing images with AI through a chat bot and online whiteboard. Through co-creation with designers in the field, we found that AI image generation can boost designerly co-creation, yet needs careful embedding into a workflow to leverage inspirational and communicative creations. We close with a critical perspective on the implications of this technology for design and discuss limitations and future work.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation aims to ameliorate deficits in motor control via intensive practice with the affected limb. Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers. We present the initial quantitative results, which support several aspects of our design rationales and conclude with our future study plans.},

We first present GANspire, a deep learning tool that generates fine-grained breathing waveforms, which we crafted in collaboration with one respiratory physician, attending to joint materialities of human breathing data and deep generative models. We then relate a probe, produced with breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, and led with a group of ten respiratory care experts, responding to its material attributes. Qualitative annotations showed that respiratory care experts interpreted both realistic and ambiguous attributes of breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, according to subjective aspects of physiology, activity and emotion. Semi-structured interviews also revealed experts' broader perceptions, expectations and ethical concerns on AI technology, based on their clinical practice of respiratory care, and reflexive analysis of GANspire. These findings suggest design implications for technological aids in respiratory care, and show how ambiguity of deep generative models can be leveraged as a resource for qualitative inquiry, enabling socio-material research with generative deep learning. Our paper contributes to the CSCW community by broadening how generative deep learning may be approached not only as a tool to design human-computer interactions, but also as a probe to provoke open conversations with communities of practice about their current and speculative uses of AI technology.},

abstract = {Despite the prevalence of mental health conditions, stigma, lack of awareness, and limited resources impede access to care, creating a need to improve mental health support. The recent surge in scientific and commercial interest in conversational agents and their potential to improve diagnosis and treatment seems a potentially fruitful area in this respect, particularly for young adults who widely use such systems in other contexts. Yet, there is little research that considers the acceptability of conversational agents in mental health. This study, therefore, presents three research activities that explore whether conversational agents and, in particular, chatbots can be an acceptable solution in mental healthcare for young adults. First, a survey of young adults (in a university setting) provides an understanding of the landscape of mental health in this age group and of their views around mental health technology, including chatbots. Second, a literature review synthesises current evidence relating to the acceptability of mental health conversational agents and points to future research priorities. Third, interviews with counsellors who work with young adults, supported by a chatbot prototype and user-centred design techniques, reveal the perceived benefits and potential roles of mental health chatbots from the perspective of mental health professionals, while suggesting preconditions for the acceptability of the technology. Taken together, these research activities: provide evidence that chatbots are an acceptable solution to offering mental health support for young adults; identify specific challenges relating to both the technology and environment; and argue for the application of user-centred approaches during development of mental health chatbots and more systematic and rigorous evaluations of the resulting solutions.},

In this paper, such a CPS named D&amp;RSense has been proposed to promote smart transportation in order to make travelling more comfortable and safe. By studying driving patterns of drivers, D&amp;RSense can get valuable insights to their braking and accelerating styles which can help to give them real-time warnings when they drive aggressively. Detection of rash driving prone areas across the city can help to recommend which areas of the city need stricter surveillance. D&amp;RSense involves smartphones of commuters and utilizes their accelerometer and GPS sensors to detect driving events like braking and acceleration as well as poor road conditions like bumps and potholes by applying the ensemble learning method for classification, Random Forest (RF). The accuracy of the same has been compared to other supervised machine learning classifiers like Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Rash-driving prone areas and poor road segments during the course of the experiment have been plotted using Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Effectiveness of the proposed application has been evaluated through extensive testing.},

Based on the resulting insights and ideas, we implemented a first prototype that balances individual feedback visualizations with detailed user profiles, a user journey and a communication feature. The prototype was assessed in seven focus groups with a total of 26 participants and with the AttrakDiff questionnaire. We found out that the persona view, the user journey view and the flexible filters of our prototype allowed designers to gain a insightful picture of users' experiences.

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

abstract = {Algorithms as a component of decision-making in healthcare are becoming increasingly prevalent and AI in healthcare has become a topic of mass consideration. However, pursuing these methods without a human-centered framework can lead to bias, thus incorporating discrimination on behalf of the algorithm upon implementation. By examining each step of the design process from a human-centered perspective and incorporating stakeholder motivations, algorithmic implementation can become vastly useful, and more accurately tailored to stakeholder needs. We examine previous work in healthcare executed with a human-centered design, to analyze the multiple frameworks which effectively create human-centered application, as extended to healthcare.},

While applications have been developed to assist in the treatment of these illnesses, the specific psychological characteristics of these disorders have rarely been considered extensively in the design process. Here, we explore how an understanding of the low-level characteristics of bipolar disorder, combined with a clinically-validated treatment and patients' lived experience, can inform mHealth design. We present a novel method -- in situ design -- to support ecologically valid design, and demonstrate its use through the co-development with 9 individuals with bipolar disorder of MoodRhythm, a mobile application designed to track and stabilize daily routines. We provide evidence that mHealth design elements tailored to the characteristics and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder can result in engaging interactions.},

abstract = {Emerging methods for participatory algorithm design have proposed collecting and aggregating individual stakeholders’ preferences to create algorithmic systems that account for those stakeholders’ values. Drawing on two years of research across two public school districts in the United States, we study how families and school districts use students’ preferences for schools to meet their goals in the context of algorithmic student assignment systems. We find that the design of the preference language, i.e. the structure in which participants must express their needs and goals to the decision-maker, shapes the opportunities for meaningful participation. We define three properties of preference languages – expressiveness, cost, and collectivism – and discuss how these factors shape who is able to participate, and the extent to which they are able to effectively communicate their needs to the decision-maker. Reflecting on these findings, we offer implications and paths forward for researchers and practitioners who are considering applying a preference-based model for participation in algorithmic decision making.},

abstract = {Smart homes have long been proposed as a viable mechanism to promote independent living for older adults in the home environment. Despite tremendous progress on the technology front, there has been limited uptake by end-users. A critical barrier to the adoption of smart home technology by older adults is the lack of engagement of end-users in the development process and the resulting one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to recognize the specific needs of the older adult demographic. In this paper, we propose a novel online platform aimed at closing the gap between older adults and technology developers: ASPIRE (Alignment of Social Personas in Inclusive Research Engagement). ASPIRE is an online collaborative network (OCN) that allows older adults, care partners, and developers to engage in the design and development of a joint shared product: the smart-home solution. To promote the adoption of the OCN and the alignment of this collaborative network with the values and emotional needs of its end-users, ASPIRE harnesses a social-psychological theory of identity. This paper presents ASPIRE as a conceptual model, with a preliminary implementation.},

abstract = {A key challenge in human-robot interaction (HRI) design is to create and sustain engaging social interactions. This paper argues that improvisational techniques from the performing arts can address this challenge. Contrary to the ways in which improvisation is generally used in social robotics, we propose an understanding of improvisational techniques as based on rules that shape motion choices. We claim that such an approach, represented in what we name the "external" and "emergent" perspectives on improvisation, could benefit the way in which robot movement and behaviour is designed and deployed, increasing playful engagement and responsiveness. As an example of this type of improvisation, we discuss how American dancer and choreographer William Forsythe's Improvisation Technologies could be used in an HRI context. We also report on a preliminary experimentation using a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory prototyping system and a participatory design method with professional dancers geared towards the exploration of interactive movement possibilities with a Pepper robot. Finally, we report on how this workshop offered valuable information about the applicability of these tools, as well as reflections on how it could help increase the level of engagement in the interaction.},

Both frameworks define a series of "pragmatic dimensions" of ontologies. Because our derived framework does not cover all possible dimensions, we propose to complement it, by relying on existing work from the Ontology Engineering community in general, and from the Pragmatic Web community in particular. In conclusion, we invite the Pragmatic Web community to pursue such a work by jointly elaborating a consensual "Pragmatic Ontology Framework".},

We focus on the forms of HCI knowledge and practice that proved useful to a coalition of community organizations claiming rights of input into and political oversight over surveillance technology. Their claims were a response to their exclusion from decision-making about smart city implementation in San Diego. We offer tactics “from below” as a way to attune HCI to the needs and practices of those excluded from power over widespread technology infrastructures. Ultimately, we argue that HCI cultivates a variety of capacities beyond design and redesign that can strengthen struggles to shape real-world technologies from below.},

We contribute to this growing body of work by describing and analysing the perspectives of people and organisations who made submissions in response to Australia's proposed 'AI Ethics Framework', the first framework of its kind to include 'contestability' as a core ethical principle. Our findings reveal that while the nature of contestability is disputed, it is seen as a way to protect individuals, and it resembles contestability in relation to human decision-making.

Specifically, we discuss the results of four focus groups where we used contestational artifacts to promote critical discussions and confront taken-for-granted beliefs among stakeholders. We reflect on the results to distill methodological insight and design recommendations for conducting adversarial participatory design research as a way towards confronting dominant narratives. Together with the methodological approach, the main contribution of this work, we also provide a set of narrative tensions that can be used to question common beliefs surrounding automated driving futures.},

In particular, low-vision readers using magnification encounter additional barriers to quickly skimming and visually locating information. In this work, we explored the design of interfaces to enable readers to: 1) navigate papers more easily, and 2) input the required navigation hooks that AI cannot currently automate. To explore this design space, we ran two exploratory studies. The first focused on current practices of low-vision paper readers, the challenges they encounter, and the interfaces they desire. During this study, low-vision participants were interviewed, and tried out four new paper navigation prototypes. Results from this study grounded the design of our end-to-end system prototype Ocean, which provides an accessible front-end for low-vision readers, and enables all readers to contribute to the backend by leaving traces of their reading paths for others to leverage. Our second study used this exploratory interface in a field study with groups of low-vision and sighted readers to probe the user experience of reading and creating traces. Our findings suggest that it may be possible for readers of all abilities to organically leave traces in papers, and that these traces can be used to facilitate navigation tasks, in particular for low-vision readers. Based on our findings, we present design considerations for creating future paper-reading tools that improve access, and organically source the required data from readers.},

abstract = {Cyberbullying is a growing problem across social media platforms, inflicting short and long-lasting effects on victims. To mitigate this problem, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around the roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations of humans. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection. We analyzed 56 papers based on a three-prong human-centeredness algorithm design framework - spanning theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. We found that the past literature fell short of incorporating human-centeredness across multiple aspects, ranging from defining cyberbullying, establishing the ground truth in data annotation, evaluating the performance of the detection models, to speculating the usage and users of the models, including potential harms and negative consequences. Given the sensitivities of the cyberbullying experience and the deep ramifications cyberbullying incidents bear on the involved actors, we discuss takeaways on how incorporating human-centeredness in future research can aid with developing detection systems that are more practical, useful, and tuned to the diverse needs and contexts of the stakeholders.},

abstract = {Emotion-aware services are increasingly used in different applications such as gaming, mental health tracking, video conferencing, and online tutoring. The core of such services is usually a machine learning model that automatically infers its user's emotions based on different biological indicators (e.g., physiological signals and facial expressions). However, such machine learning models often require a large number of emotion annotations or ground truth labels, which are typically collected as manual self-reports by conducting long-term user studies, commonly known as Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Responding to repetitive ESM probes for self-reports is time-consuming and fatigue-inducing. The burden of repetitive self-report collection leads to users responding arbitrarily or dropping out from the studies, compromising the model performance. To counter this issue, we, in this paper, propose a Human-AI Collaborative Emotion self-report collection framework, HACE, that reduces the self-report collection effort significantly. HACE encompasses an active learner, bootstrapped with a few emotion self-reports (as seed samples), and enables the learner to query for only not-so-confident instances to retrain the learner to predict the emotion self-reports more efficiently. We evaluated the framework in a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection scenario by performing a 3-week in-the-wild study (N = 32). The evaluation of HACE on this dataset (≈11,000 typing sessions corresponding to more than 200 hours of typing data) demonstrates that it requires 46% fewer self-reports than the baselines to train the emotion self-report detection model and yet outperforms the baselines with an average self-report detection F-score of 85%. These findings demonstrate the possibility of adopting such a human-AI collaborative approach to reduce emotion self-report collection efforts.},

This program is designed for pregnant women in rural Assam in India. We observed the gestures of 24 pregnant women to determine how to present the following seven computational functions that were used in the health information program: Select, Pause, Resume, Help, Activate Menu, Next, and Previous. The participants belonged to the low socio-economic strata in rural Assam, India and most had poor literacy levels. A participatory approach through a user-generated gesture collection method was used for this study. This study produced a total of 49 different gestures that participants performed to represent the seven computational functions.

abstract = {Word embeddings are numeric representations of meaning derived from word co-occurrence statistics in corpora of human-produced texts. The statistical regularities in language corpora encode well-known social biases into word embeddings (e.g., the word vector for family is closer to the vector women than to men). Although efforts have been made to mitigate bias in word embeddings, with the hope of improving fairness in downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, these efforts will remain limited until we more deeply understand the multiple (and often subtle) ways that social biases can be reflected in word embeddings. Here, we focus on gender to provide a comprehensive analysis of group-based biases in widely-used static English word embeddings trained on internet corpora (GloVe 2014, fastText 2017). While some previous research has helped uncover biases in specific semantic associations between a group and a target domain (e.g., women - family), using the Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence of gender biases that also show differences in: (1) frequencies of words associated with men versus women; (b) part-of-speech tags in gender-associated words; (c) semantic categories in gender-associated words; and (d) valence, arousal, and dominance in gender-associated words. We leave the analysis of non-binary gender to future work due to the challenges in accurate group representation caused by limitations inherent in data.First, in terms of word frequency: we find that, of the 1,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary, 77% are more associated with men than women, providing direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of the English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top male-associated words are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the top female-associated words are typically adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving, emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate parts-of-speech. Third, for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000 words associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and domains of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast, the top female-associated concepts are less focused on roles, including, instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content, as well as appearance and kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and dominance from a ~20,000 word lexicon, we find that male-associated words are higher on arousal and dominance, while female-associated words are higher on valence. Ultimately, these findings move the study of gender bias in word embeddings beyond the basic investigation of semantic relationships to also study gender differences in multiple manifestations in text. Given the central role of word embeddings in NLP applications, it is essential to more comprehensively document where biases exist and may remain hidden, allowing them to persist without our awareness throughout large text corpora.},

abstract = {This paper argues for the inclusion of tools that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) in information technology (IT) undergraduate courses that teach the fundamentals of software. LLM tools have become widely available and disrupt traditional methods for teaching software concepts. Learning objectives are compromised when students submit AI-generated code for a classroom assignment without comprehending or validating the code. Since LLM tools including OpenAI Codex, Copilot by GitHub, and ChatGPT are being used in industry for software development, students need to be familiar with their use without compromising student learning. Incorporating LLM tools into the curriculum prepares students for real-world software development. However, students still need to understand software fundamentals including how to write and debug code. There are many challenges associated with the inclusion of AI tools into the IT curriculum that need to be addressed and mitigated. This paper presents strategies and techniques to integrate student use of LLM tools, assist students’ interaction with the tools, and help prepare students for careers that increasingly use AI tools to design, develop, and maintain software.},

abstract = {Explanations of AI Agents' actions are considered to be an important factor in improving users' trust in the decisions made by autonomous AI systems. However, as these autonomous systems evolve from reactive, i.e., acting on user input, to proactive, i.e., acting without requiring user intervention, there is a need to explore how the explanation for the actions of these agents should evolve. In this work, we explore the design of explanations through participatory design methods for a proactive auto-response messaging agent that can reduce perceived obligations and social pressure to respond quickly to incoming messages by providing unavailability-related context. We recruited 14 participants who worked in pairs during collaborative design sessions where they reasoned about the agent's design and actions. We qualitatively analyzed the data collected through these sessions and found that participants' reasoning about agent actions led them to speculate heavily on its design. These speculations significantly influenced participants' desire for explanations and the controls they sought to inform the agents' behavior. Our findings indicate a need to transform users' speculations into accurate mental models of agent design. Further, since the agent acts as a mediator in human-human communication, it is also necessary to account for social norms in its explanation design. Finally, user expertise in understanding their habits and behaviors allows the agent to learn from the user their preferences when justifying its actions.},

Engagement in iterative design activities with clinicians over the course of two years revealed a strong need for time-based features and mechanisms, including timestamps for tasks based on absolute time and automatic stopclocks measuring time by counting up since task performance. We describe in detail the aspects of temporal awareness central to clinicians' awareness needs and then provide examples of how we addressed these needs through the design of a shared information display. As an outcome of this process, we define four types of time representation techniques to facilitate the design of time-based features: (1) timestamps based on absolute time, (2) timestamps relative to the process start time, (3) time since task performance, and (4) time until the next required task.},

However, we still lack an understanding of how to develop machine learning systems with fairness criteria that reflect relevant stakeholders’ nuanced viewpoints in real-world contexts. To address this gap, we propose a framework for eliciting stakeholders’ subjective fairness notions. Combining a user interface that allows stakeholders to examine the data and the algorithm’s predictions with an interview protocol to probe stakeholders’ thoughts while they are interacting with the interface, we can identify stakeholders’ fairness beliefs and principles. We conduct a user study to evaluate our framework in the setting of a child maltreatment predictive system. Our evaluations show that the framework allows stakeholders to comprehensively convey their fairness viewpoints. We also discuss how our results can inform the design of predictive systems.},

abstract = {Iterative user-centred design has become a standard approach for developing interactive products. This process relies on prototyping and usertesting as early as possible to deliver a positive user experience and ensure that final products align with designers' intentions. The video game industry has benefited greatly from this design approach, with games user researchers adapting and introducing various evaluation techniques. However, repeatedly creating game builds suitable for usertesting (i.e., high-fidelity prototypes) is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, recruiting users and conducting evaluation sessions are labour-intensive tasks. These challenges are especially pressing in the evaluation of game level and world design, where designers may wish to evaluate many alternatives or rapidly measure the impact of many small design changes on a game's ability to deliver the intended experience. To support developers grappling with these challenges, we have developed PathOS, a novel tool for simulating testing sessions with agents that model player navigation. This paper reports on our development objectives, implementation, and a user study with professional game developers to assess PathOS' application in a level design context. Our results demonstrate the ability of an automated testing tool to enhance the workflow of practicing developers.},

Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the method reveal that the values personas concretely shaped annotators' sensitivity judgments, and analysis of the test collection itself demonstrates that the sensitivity annotations have utility for identifying features that may correlate with email sensitivity.

To design and develop detection systems that are capable of achieving satisfactory performance, a thorough understanding of the nature and properties of the targeted type of conflictual language is of great importance. The scientific communities investigating human psychology and social behavior have studied these languages in details, but their insights have only partially reached the computer science community.In this survey, we aim both at systematically characterizing the conceptual properties of online conflictual languages, and at investigating the extent to which they are reflected in state-of-the-art automatic detection systems. Through an analysis of psychology literature, we provide a reconciled taxonomy that denotes the ensemble of conflictual languages typically studied in computer science. We then characterize the conceptual mismatches that can be observed in the main semantic and contextual properties of these languages and their treatment in computer science works; and systematically uncover resulting technical biases in the design of machine learning classification models and the dataset created for their training. Finally, we discuss diverse research opportunities for the computer science community and reflect on broader technical and structural issues.},

These technologies have concerning implications for workers’ ability to exercise labor rights, build collective power, and exercise autonomy at work. In this paper, I argue that worker-led technology design and data-driven research is a key step to ensure fair working futures under these conditions. First, synthesizing scholarship from legal, economic, and HCI fields, I outline the complex reasons behind why many modern workers suffer from an ”information asymmetry” at work, and argue why it will likely expand broadly to knowledge work. I then argue that data sharing is an important way that workers can counter algorithmic and data-driven management to improve working conditions, making the case that access to information is a crucial part of labor organizing. Finally, I argue for researchers in the CHI and CSCW fields to engage in a new kind of ”Digital Workerism”: worker-led research into data collection, analysis, and governance tools that could help provide the labor movement in the US with the tools to change the course of worker power.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

The case study consists of a participant observed while searching and browsing the internet for campaign information in a mock-voting situation while taking notes that were to be shared with others. Interaction analysis of the case study data consisted of applying Information Foraging Theory to understand participant specific behaviors in searching and browsing. Case study results show skewed time allocation to activities, a tradeoff between enrichment vs. exploitation of search results, and issues with lack of scent, low value perception, and value depletion of information. Potential implications for voter-centered design of e-voting portals are discussed and future work is outlined.},

abstract = {Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists’ expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.},

abstract = {What does it mean when we design for accessibility, inclusivity and "dissolving boundaries" -- particularly those boundaries between the design philosophy, the software/interface actuality and the stated goals? This paper is about the principles underlying a research project called 'The Little Grey Cat engine' or greyCat. GreyCat has grown out of our experience in using commercial game engines as production environments for the transmission of culture and experience through the telling of individual stories. The key to this endeavour is the potential of the greyCat software to visualize worlds and the manner in which non-formal stories are intertwined with place. The apparently simple dictum of "show, don't tell" and the use of 3D game engines as a medium disguise an interesting nexus of problematic issues and questions, particularly in the ramifications for cultural dimensions and participatory interaction design. The engine is currently in alpha and the following paper is its background story. In this paper we discuss the problematic, thrown into sharp relief by a particular project, and we continue to unpack concepts and early designs behind the greyCat itself.},

We introduce Scones, a mixed-initiative, machine-learning-driven system that enables users to iteratively author sketches from text instructions. Scones is a novel deep-learning-based system that iteratively generates scenes of sketched objects composed with semantic specifications from natural language. Scones exceeds state-of-the-art performance on a text-based scene modification task, and introduces a mask-conditioned sketching model that can generate sketches with poses specified by high-level scene information. In an exploratory user evaluation of Scones, participants reported enjoying an iterative drawing task with Scones, and suggested additional features for further applications. We believe Scones is an early step towards automated, intelligent systems that support human-in-the-loop applications for communicating ideas through sketching in art and design.},

This study introduces the concept of co-creation with a robot agent into culturally-responsive computing (CRC). Co-creation with computer agents has previously focused on creating external artifacts. Our work differs by making the robot agent itself the co-created product. Through participatory design activities, we positioned adolescent girls and an agentic social robot as co-creators of the robot’s identity. Taking a thematic analysis approach, we examined how girls embody the role of creator and co-creator in this space. We identified themes surrounding who has the power to make decisions, what decisions are made, and how to maintain social relationship. Our findings suggest that co-creation with robot technology is a promising implementation vehicle for realizing CRC.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of home and social robot products, it is essential for the general population to feel comfortable in using and understanding these robots in their homes. The goal of this research is to understand the general population's definition of "robot state." We conducted 11 participatory design groups (PDGs) (n=30), in which participants completed two exercises: (1) Memory based: they recalled their past robots to come up with a working "robot state" definition through a series of exercises, and (2) Example-based: they saw short videos of 3 different home robots. Each PDG session yielded a set of "robot states" they felt were important to communicate to a user and a "robot state" definition, which were tested with the same set of participants via an online survey. We found that On/off/booting was significantly rated as more important than all other robot states. Interestingly, task-related stimuli did not result in task-related states being rated being more important to communicate to the user. We believe establishing fundamental knowledge of "robot states" will increase acceptability of home robots by the users and aid robot designers by providing information on states that are essential to be communicated.},

abstract = {Despite its benefits for children’s skill development and parent-child bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy’s design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy’s usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.},

abstract = {Requirements elicitation is a crucial process in software engineering, which involves identifying and understanding the needs of stakeholders to define system requirements. Several techniques are used for requirements elicitation, each with unique advantages, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among 33 practitioners in the software development community to investigate their experiences with requirements elicitation techniques. The results revealed that practitioners find the elicitation process highly challenging due to difficulties managing the relationship between the development team and the client, understanding complex business processes, and the lack of knowledge among stakeholders. The survey also assessed the participants’ familiarity with various elicitation techniques. The most well-known techniques were brainstorming, data analysis, use cases, interviews, user stories, and prototyping. In contrast, techniques such as ethnography, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Joint Application Development (JAD), blueprint, and laddering were less recognized. When providing the pros and cons of some techniques, participants considered techniques’ clarity, speed of use, resource cost, and stakeholder involvement. This research contributes to the field by highlighting challenges, providing insights into practitioner experiences, and guiding informed decision-making in requirements elicitation.},

I want to mention some projects conducted by my research group "Digital Media in Education" at the University of Bremen, Germany, where we try to develop software for women and women's projects and to take a more user-friendly look at the processes of software development.},

To complement and extend managerial and engineering descriptions emphasizing the functionality and performance of these devices, we used recuperative approaches to re-center the socio-material realities of workers on-the-ground. For example, workers reported concerns on the safety of the devices in congested areas and a need for more comprehensive training across all levels of the organization.

abstract = {This study is part of a larger project that showed the potential of our mixed reality (MR) system in fostering social initiation behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). We compared it to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools, where both mediated a face-to-face dyadic play session between an ASC child and a non-ASC child. In this study, our first goal is to show that an MR platform can be utilized to alter the nonverbal body behavior between ASC and non-ASC during social interaction as much as a traditional therapy setting (LEGO). A second goal is to show how these body cues differ between ASC and non-ASC children during social initiation in these two platforms. We present our first analysis of the body cues generated under two conditions in a repeated-measures design. Body cue measurements were obtained through skeleton information and characterized in the form of spatio-temporal features from both subjects individually (e.g. distances between joints and velocities of joints), and interpersonally (e.g. proximity and visual focus of attention). We used machine learning techniques to analyze the visual data of eighteen trials of ASC and non-ASC dyads. Our experiments showed that: (i) there were differences between ASC and non-ASC bodily expressions, both at individual and interpersonal level, in LEGO and in the MR system during social initiation; (ii) the number of features indicating differences between ASC and non-ASC in terms of nonverbal behavior during initiation were higher in the MR system as compared to LEGO; and (iii) computational models evaluated with combination of these different features enabled the recognition of social initiation type (ASC or non-ASC) from body features in LEGO and in MR settings. We did not observe significant differences between the evaluated models in terms of performance for LEGO and MR environments. This might be interpreted as the MR system encouraging similar nonverbal behaviors in children, perhaps more similar than the LEGO environment, as the performance scores in the MR setting are lower as compared to the LEGO setting. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of full body interaction and MR settings for children with ASC.},

abstract = {Investigative data journalists work with a variety of data sources to tell a story. Though prior work has indicated that there is a close relationship between journalists' data work practices and that of data scientists. However, these relationships and data work practices are not empirically examined, and understanding them is crucial to inform the design of tools that are used by different groups of people including data scientists and data journalists. Thus, to bridge this gap, we studied investigative reporters' data work practices with one non-profit investigative newsroom. Our study design includes two activities: 1) semi-structured interviews with journalists, and 2) a sketching activity allowing journalists to depict examples of their work practices. By analyzing these data and synthesizing them across related prior work, we propose the major phases in the data-driven investigative journalism story idea generation process. Our study findings show that the journalists employ a collection of multiple, iterative, cyclic processes to identify journalistically "interesting'' story ideas. These processes both significantly resemble and show subtle nuanced differences with data science work practices identified in prior research. We further verified our proposal through a member check with key informants. This work offers three primary contributions. First, it provides a close glimpse into the main phases of investigative journalists' data-driven story idea generation technique. Second, it complements prior work studying formal data science practices by examining data-driven investigative journalists, whose primary expertise lies outside computing. Third, it identifies particular points in the data exploration processes that would benefit from design interventions and suggests future research directions.},

abstract = {Energy systems researchers are proposing a broad range of future "smart" energy infrastructures to promote more efficient management of energy resources. This paper considers how consumers might relate to these future smart grids within the UK. To address this challenge we exploited a combination of demonstration and animated sketches to convey the nature of a future smart energy infrastructure based on software agents. Users' reactions suggested that although they felt an obligation to engage with energy issues, they were principally disinterested. Users showed a considerable lack of trust in energy companies raising a dilemma of design. While users might welcome agents to help in engaging with complex energy infrastructures, they had little faith in those that might provide them. This suggests the need to consider how to design software agents to enhance trust in these socio-economic settings.},

abstract = {User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design have become an indispensable part of today’s tech industry. Recently, much progress has been made in machine-learning-enabled design support tools for UX designers. However, few of these tools have been adopted by practitioners. To learn the underlying reasons and understand user needs for bridging this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis with 8 UX professionals to understand their practice and identify opportunities for future research. We found that the current AI-enabled systems to support UX work mainly work on graphical interface elements, while design activities that involve more ‘design thinking” such as user interviews and user testings are more helpful for designers. Many current systems were also designed for overly-simplistic and generic use scenarios. We identified 4 areas in the UX workflow that can benefit from additional AI-enabled assistance: design inspiration search, design alternative exploration, design system customization, and design guideline violation check.},

abstract = {For adult newcomers to countries such as Canada, learning language is more than an academic task. Language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. Many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. To explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in English, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. Post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. We discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities.},

abstract = {The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation has become a topic of conversation across HCI, CSCW, and other computing communities. This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring” through co-designed speculative design fictions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fictions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},

abstract = {When designing artificial intelligence (AI) in politicised contexts, such as the public sector, optimistic promises of what AI can achieve often shape decisions around which problems AI should address. Different epistemological views carry different understandings of what is considered the problem at hand, and, as we show in this paper, ethnographic perspectives often fail to match the politicised promises of AI. This paper reflects on personal experiences from an interdisciplinary research project that aimed to take a responsible approach to research and design AI for public services in Denmark. Seeking alternatives to the inflexible algorithms [3, 38] often used to automate or augment specific decision-making tasks in these contexts [1, 2, 35], our research project took a flexible approach to research and design and included ethnographic workplace studies to explore whether AI could both leverage the increasing powers of computing and retain the discretion of the user [23]. Following Mesman [33], we present three empirical moments that were particularly challenging for us as ethnographic researchers and influenced our project in important ways regarding the problems for AI to solve. Problematising [6] them, enabled us to surface how ‘readiness’, emerging from the politicised context of AI in Denmark, had confounded our efforts at interdisciplinary collaboration. Problematisation, then, allowed us to come to a new understanding of the problem at hand and open up a space to collaboratively re-imagine the problems for AI to solve. This paper is in the spirit of serving as a bridge between our initial and revised understanding, pointing to the ongoing discussion in HCI about ‘bridging the gap’ between ethnography and design. Our contribution is a discussion of how researchers and designers might engage with problematisation at the frontiers of HCI to develop an open-ended approach to collaborative AI design in politicised contexts.},

Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.},

However, the way in which such disruptive technologies could be deployed in various areas of digital government needs systematic investigation to understand emerging research and training needs. Future scenarios can be used as a method to elicit potential future evolutions of new technologies. In this paper, we suggest a future scenarios technique to identify research and training needs along the introduction of new disruptive technologies in the public sector. The paper describes the methodology of this scenario approach and an exemplification of identifying research and training needs relating to the implementation of Internet of things in public service provisioning, based on the application of the scenario approach. The methodology foresees expert engagement in the interactive workshops aimed at identification and prioritisation of the needs through a moderated discussion of the pre-constructed future scenarios. The methodology proved to be a useful tool for the identification of the research and training needs based on the expert input and produced useful and useable results during its application.},

abstract = {AI curricula are being developed and tested in classrooms, but wider adoption is premised by teacher professional development and buy-in. When engaging in professional development, curricula are treated as set in stone, static and educators are prepared to offer the curriculum as written instead of empowered to be leaders in efforts to spread and sustain AI education. This limits the degree to which teachers tailor new curricula to student needs and interests, ultimately distancing students from new and potentially relevant content. This paper describes an AI Educator Make-a-Thon, a two-day gathering of 34 educators from across the United States that centered co-design of AI literacy materials as the culminating experience of a year-long professional development program called Everyday AI (EdAI) in which educators studied and practiced implementing an innovative curriculum for Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) in their classrooms. Inspired by the energizing and empowering experiences of Hack-a-Thons, the Make-a-Thon was designed to increase the depth and longevity of the educators' investment in AI education by positively impacting their sense of belonging to the AI community, AI content knowledge, and their self confidence as AI curriculum designers. In this paper we describe the Make-a-Thon design, findings, and recommendations for future educator-centered Make-a-Thons.},

In our case, a local community suffered from air pollution caused by industrial activity. The residents lacked the technological fluency to gather and curate diverse scientific data to advocate for regulatory change. We collaborated with the community in developing an air quality monitoring system which integrated heterogeneous data over a large spatial and temporal scale. The system afforded strong scientific evidence by using animated smoke images, air quality data, crowdsourced smell reports, and wind data. In our evaluation, we report patterns of sharing smoke images among stakeholders. Our survey study shows that the scientific knowledge provided by the system encourages agonistic discussions with regulators, empowers the community to support policy making, and rebalances the power relationship between stakeholders.},

abstract = {A number of initiatives invite members of the public to perform online classification tasks such as identifying objects in images. These tasks are crucial to numerous large-scale Citizen Science projects in different disciplines, with volunteers using their knowledge and online support tools to, for example, identify species of wildlife or classify galaxies by their shapes. However, for complex classification tasks, such as this case study on identifying species of bumblebee, reaching an agreement between volunteers - or even between experts~-~may require consensus-building processes. Collaboration and teamwork approaches to problem solving and decision-making have been widely documented to improve both task performance and user learning in the real world. Most of these processes and projects are mediated online through feedback delivered in an asynchronous manner, and this article thus addresses a central research question: How do participants involved in species identification tasks respond to different forms of feedback provided in online collaboration, designed to support peer-learning and improve task performance? We tested four different approaches to feedback within a collaboration task, where participants reviewed their previously annotated data based on information curated from their peers on a long running online citizen science initiative. The selected interfaces have a strong foundation in social science and psychology literature and can be applied to citizen science practices as well as other online communities. Results showed that while all four approaches increased accuracy, there were differences based on the types of consensus that existed before collaboration. Such differences highlight the usefulness of different forms of feedback during collaboration for increasing data accuracy of identification and furthering users' expertise on identification tasks. We found that anonymised and goal-directed free text comments posted on social learning interfaces were most effective in improving data accuracy as well as creating opportunities for peer-learning, particularly where the species identification task was more difficult. This study has significant implications for extending the practice of citizen science across formal and informal learning environments and reaching out to a variety of users.},

What if the participatory process was extended during the design phase of an ARG as well? Few, if any, studies have explored how to include player populations in the ARG design process -- especially ARGs that target youth. In this paper, we share the process we followed to design a large-scale ARG to promote scientific inquiry for teenagers (13-17 years old) by partnering with them. Our findings suggest that co-designing with youth resulted in novel design features in the final game, and gave us insight into adolescent attitudes toward various scientific concepts. We also share co-design techniques that were not as effective and offer suggestions for future approaches.},

abstract = {Perinatal stroke (PS) is a serious condition that, if undetected and thus untreated, often leads to life-long disability, in particular Cerebral Palsy (CP). In clinical settings, Prechtl's General Movement Assessment (GMA) can be used to classify infant movements using a Gestalt approach, identifying infants at high risk of developing PS. Training and maintenance of assessment skills are essential and expensive for the correct use of GMA, yet many practitioners lack these skills, preventing larger-scale screening and leading to significant risks of missing opportunities for early detection and intervention for affected infants. We present an automated approach to GMA, based on body-worn accelerometers and a novel sensor data analysis method--Discriminative Pattern Discovery (DPD)--that is designed to cope with scenarios where only coarse annotations of data are available for model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a study with 34 newborns (21 typically developing infants and 13 PS infants with abnormal movements). Our method is able to correctly recognise the trials with abnormal movements with at least the accuracy that is required by newly trained human annotators (75%), which is encouraging towards our ultimate goal of an automated PS screening system that can be used population-wide.},

Although rapid technological advancements are driving the development and maturation of robotics platforms across a range of domains, the methods by which people work with these platforms remains a largely open question. Unpacking this solution requires a multifaceted approach with key contributions from diverse fields and disciplines including user modelling, adaptive interfaces, persistent communication, interaction design, human factors, and situational awareness. This workshop intends to discuss the opportunities, threats, and future of collaborative robotics. We invite researchers and practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics and Engineering, Ethics, Psychology, Social Sciences, Design, Architecture, and Artificial Intelligence, who work actively or wish to expand their knowledge to discuss the requirements for next-generation human-robot collaboration, and synthesise a path towards the future where people and robots work hand in hand.},

abstract = {In less than a year’s time, March 2022 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the first documented game jam, the Indie Game Jam, which took place in Oakland, California in 2002. Initially, game jams were widely seen as frivolous activities. Since then, they have taken the world by storm. Game jams have not only become part of the day-to-day process of many game developers, but jams are also used for activist purposes, for learning and teaching, as part of the experience economy, for making commercial prototypes that gamers can vote on, and more. Beyond only surveying game jams and the relevant published scientific literature from the last two decades, this paper has several additional contributions. It builds a history of game jams, and proposes two different taxonomies of game jams — a historical and a categorical. In addition, it discusses the definition of game jam and identifies the most active research areas within the game jam community such as the interplay and development with local communities, the study and analysis of game jammers and organisers, and works that bring a critical look on game jams.},

abstract = {Automated passive sensing applications and self-reported smart diaries seem to hold promise for the management of anxiety in autism and other mental health conditions. However, passive sensing often struggles with noisy data, ambiguous feedback and weak user agency over the device, whilst self-reporting relies on user-entered data which can be time consuming and cognitively demanding. To address these limitations, we explore a different approach, whereby individuals consciously actuate personal data capture and are in control of it at all times; yet, the interaction solely involves clicking a button, thus avoiding cognitive overload whilst supporting immediate reflection. We call this approach intentive computing. Through our initial investigations we found that conscious interactions cannot only provide real-time relief in anxiety management, but can also function as memory anchors irrespective of the content captured and even prior to data visualization.},

In this paper, we explore the contribution of creative AI tools to overcome design fixation and enhance creative processes in HRI design. In a four weeks long design exploration, we used generative text-to-image models to ideate and visualise robotic artefacts and robot sociotechnical imaginaries. We exchanged results along with reflections through a digital postcard format. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to imagining novel robot concepts, surfacing existing assumptions and robot stereotypes, and situating robotic artefacts in context. We discuss the contribution to designerly HRI practices and conclude with lessons learnt for using creative AI tools as an emerging design practice in HRI research and beyond.},

abstract = {Major humanitarian organizations face the crucial challenge of estimating land damage from conflict in developing countries. A lack of on the ground data collection motivates the use of satellite imagery to meet this challenge. However, existing analysis methods involving satellite imagery are time-consuming, require special expertise, or lack automation. To mitigate these obstacles, SatDash was designed using Sentinel-2 images and ACLED data to provide a classification of areas that have undergone land damage due to conflict in northwestern Nigeria and Mali. SatDash was constructed using free and publicly available images and is accompanied by a user-friendly dashboard that allows domain experts to train their own data and export it for future use. The dashboard was created for a humanitarian organization, referred to as the DAAO, Damage Assessment and Aid Organization, and the design process adhered to four primary recommendations for a successful AI for Social Good (AI4SG) partnership that are further detailed in this paper. Within this paper, I draw attention to the context of CHI4Good research, detailing how the deployment phases of such systems often have their own set of potential barriers, along with describing ethical challenges that arise with this type of research. This paper focuses primarily on the design process and responses to both the constraints mentioned in literature and those presented by the DAAO. I acknowledge that AI applications, especially in development contexts, require close attention and context-specific awareness, and this is reflected through the conscious decision to include domain experts and ensure that the tool is only used for its intended purpose. When designing SatDash, the primary aim was to think critically about the involvement of local context and spur the conversation about inclusive design of similar systems in a large organization such as the DAAO. This research affirms that satellite imagery data can be used to assist humanitarian aid organizations with land change detection and demonstrates how human-in-the-loop systems can aid these organizations with identification of communities negatively impacted by hunger and recurring conflict.},

abstract = {Affective computing is an imperative topic for Human-Computer Interaction, where user emotions and emotional communication can be utilized to improve the usability of a system. Several strategies are available to detect user emotions but it is questionable when identifying the most suitable and compatible strategy which can be used to detect emotions when using mobile devices. Multimodal emotion recognition paves the path to detect emotions by combining two or more strategies in order to identify the most meaningful emotion. Emotion identification through facial expressions and text analytics has given high accuracies but combining them and practically applying them in the context of a mobile environment should be done. Three prototypes were developed using evolutionary prototyping which can detect emotions from facial expressions and text data, using state of the art APIs and SDKs where the base of the prototypes was a keyboard known as "Emotional Keyboard" which is compatible with Android devices. Evaluations of Prototype 1 and 2 have been performed based on participatory design and reviewed the compatibility of emotion identification through facial expressions and text data in the mobile context. Evaluation of Prototype 3 should be done in the future and a confusion matrix should be built to verify the accuracies by cross-checking with training and validation accuracies that have been obtained when developing the neural network.},

In this paper, the use of a decision support prototype is explored to assist stakeholders in the context of public budgeting, to address the questions of what information is needed to facilitate decisions, and how to design and embed such a system. A user-centered approach was chosen, including a context analysis, qualitative interviews, and a shortened design sprint. From the insights gained, design implications as well as two hands-on application scenarios were derived. Based on this, a high-fidelity prototype was developed with modern web technologies. Afterwards, a summative evaluation was conducted in an interactive and cohesive online survey where participants could interact directly with the embedded prototype. The results show that the majority of participants expect such a system to have a positive impact on decision-making during budget preparations. Furthermore, most of the defined design requirements were fulfilled and the usability as well as the visual aesthetics of the prototype, were evaluated in a positive manner. The design implications provide a profound basis for further research and design iterations.},

abstract = {The rise of automated text processing systems has led to the development of tools designed for a wide variety of application domains. These technologies are often developed to support non-technical users such as domain experts and are often developed in isolation of the tools primary user. While such developments are exciting, less attention has been paid to domain experts’ expectations about the values embedded in these automated systems. As a step toward addressing that gap, we examined values expectations of journalists and legal experts. Both these domains involve extensive text processing and place high importance on values in professional practice. We engaged participants from two non-profit organizations in two separate co-speculation design workshops centered around several speculative automated text processing systems. This study makes three interrelated contributions. First, we provide a detailed investigation of domain experts’ values expectations around future NLP systems. Second, the speculative design fiction concepts, which we specifically crafted for these investigative journalists and legal experts, illuminated a series of tensions around the technical implementation details of automation. Third, our findings highlight the utility of design fiction in eliciting not-to-design implications, not only about automated NLP but also about technology more broadly. Overall, our study findings provide groundwork for the inclusion of domain experts values whose expertise lies outside of the field of computing into the design of automated NLP systems.},

abstract = {AI systems are becoming increasingly pervasive within children’s devices, apps, and services. However, it is not yet well-understood how risks and ethical considerations of AI relate to children. This paper makes three contributions to this area: first, it identifies ten areas of alignment between general AI frameworks and codes for age-appropriate design for children. Then, to understand how such principles relate to real application contexts, we conducted a landscape analysis of children’s AI systems, via a systematic literature review including 188 papers. This analysis revealed a wide assortment of applications, and that most systems’ designs addressed only a small subset of principles among those we identified. Finally, we synthesised our findings in a framework to inform a new “Code for Age-Appropriate AI”, which aims to provide timely input to emerging policies and standards, and inspire increased interactions between the AI and child-computer interaction communities.},

abstract = {Is it possible to detect toxicity in games just by observing in-game behavior? If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA gameFor Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been sanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players. This research shows that observing in-game behavior can support the work of community managers in moderating and possibly containing the burden of toxic behavior.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is cumbersome even for expert clinicians owing to the diversity in the symptoms exhibited by the children which depend on the severity of the disorder. Furthermore, the diagnosis is based on the behavioural observations and the developmental history of the child which has substantial dependence on the perspectives and interpretations of the specialists. In this paper, we present a robot-assisted diagnostic system for the assessment of behavioural symptoms in children for providing a reliable diagnosis. The robotic assistant is intended to support the specialist in administering the diagnostic task, perceiving and evaluating the task outcomes as well as the behavioural cues for assessment of symptoms and diagnosing the state of the child. Despite being used widely in education and intervention for children with autism (CWA), the application of robot assistance in diagnosis is less explored. Further, there have been limited studies addressing the acceptance and effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions for CWA in the Global South. We aim to develop a robot-assisted diagnostic framework for CWA to support the experts and study the viability of such a system in the Indian context.},

The flexibility of notebooks brings challenges for effective code search, where classic search interfaces for traditional software code may be limited. In this paper, we propose, NBSearch, a novel system that supports semantic code search in notebook collections and interactive visual exploration of search results. NBSearch leverages advanced machine learning models to enable natural language search queries and intuitive visualizations to present complicated intra- and inter-notebook relationships in the returned results. We developed NBSearch through an iterative participatory design process with two experts from a large software company. We evaluated the models with a series of experiments and the whole system with a controlled user study. The results indicate the feasibility of our analytical pipeline and the effectiveness of NBSearch to support code search in large notebook collections.},

Through goal setting activities, paper prototyping, and field-testing of resident designed technology probes, we present use cases, design principles and experiential insights. After sharing these findings, we introduce the emergence of smart domestic environments as possessing persuasive, personified and artful qualities.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity suffers from an oversaturation of centralized, hierarchical systems and a lack of exploration in the area of horizontal security, or security techniques and technologies which utilize democratic participation for security decision-making. Because of this, many horizontally governed organizations such as activist groups, worker cooperatives, trade unions, not-for-profit associations, and others are not represented in current cybersecurity solutions, and are forced to adopt hierarchical solutions to cybersecurity problems. This causes power dynamic mismatches that lead to cybersecurity and organizational operations failures. In this work we introduce COLBAC, a collective based access control system aimed at addressing this lack. COLBAC uses democratically authorized capability tokens to express access control policies. It allows for a flexible and dynamic degree of horizontality to meet the needs of different horizontally governed organizations. After introducing COLBAC, we finish with a discussion on future work needed to realize more horizontal security techniques, tools, and technologies.},

abstract = {How to protect people from algorithmic harms? A promising solution, although in its infancy, is algorithmic impact assessment (AIA). AIAs are iterative processes used to investigate the possible short and long terms societal impacts of AI systems before their use, but with ongoing monitoring and periodic revisiting even after their implementation. When conducted in a participatory and transparent fashion, they could create bridges across the legal, social and computer science domains, promoting the accountability of the entity performing them as well as public scrutiny. They could enable to re-attach the societal and regulatory context to the mathematical definition of fairness, thus expanding the formalistic approach thereto. Whilst the regulatory framework in the European Union currently lacks the obligation to perform such AIA, some other provisions are expected to play a role in AI development, leading the way towards more widespread adoption of AIA. These include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the risk assessment process under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Conformity Assessment (CA) foreseen under the AI Regulation proposal.In this paper, after briefly introducing the plurality of definitions of fairness in the legal, social and computer science domains, and explaining to which extent the current and upcoming legal framework mandates the adoption of fairness metrics, we will illustrate how AIA could create bridges between all these disciplines, allowing us to build fairer AI solutions. We will then recognise the role of DPIA, DSA risk assessment and CA by discussing the contributions they can offer towards AIA but also identify the aspects lacking therein. We will then identify how these assessment provisions could aid the overall technical discussion of introducing and assessing fairness in AI-based models and processes.},

How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way? As one answer to this question, we present WeBuildAI, a collective participatory framework that enables people to build algorithmic policy for their communities. The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

The main contribution of this work is the development of methods and tools for child-centered robot design. We adapted existing participatory design practices used with adults to fit children's development stages. We followed the Double-Diamond Design Process Model and rested the design process of the robot on the following principles: low floor and wide walls, creativity provocations, open-ended playfulness, and disappointment avoidance through abstraction. The final product is a social robot designed for and with children. Our results show that YOLO increases their creativity during play, demonstrating a successful robot design project. We identified several guidelines that made the design process successful: the use of toys as tools, playgrounds as spaces, the emphasis of playfulness for child expression, and child policies as allies for design studies. The design process described empowers children's in the design of robots.},

abstract = {As algorithms have become ubiquitous in consequential domains, societal concerns about the potential for discriminatory outcomes have prompted urgent calls to address algorithmic bias. In response, a rich literature across computer science, law, and ethics is rapidly proliferating to advance approaches to designing fair algorithms. Yet computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists are often not speaking the same language when using the term ‘bias.’ Debates concerning whether society can or should tackle the problem of algorithmic bias are hampered by conflations of various understandings of bias, ranging from neutral deviations from a standard to morally problematic instances of injustice due to prejudice, discrimination, and disparate treatment. This terminological confusion impedes efforts to address clear cases of discrimination. In this paper, we examine the promises and challenges of different approaches to disambiguating bias and designing for justice. While both approaches aid in understanding and addressing clear algorithmic harms, we argue that they also risk being leveraged in ways that ultimately deflect accountability from those building and deploying these systems. Applying this analysis to recent examples of generative AI, our argument highlights unseen dangers in current methods of evaluating algorithmic bias and points to ways to redirect approaches to addressing bias in generative AI at its early stages in ways that can more robustly meet the demands of justice.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent around the world, with the benefits related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability attractive in addition to the opportunity to establish entirely new capabilities. In order to operationalise autonomous systems technology it is critical to have in place the legal, regulatory and ethical infrastructure necessary to enable safe and trusted operation. While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems. The paper concludes by recommending next steps towards the regulation of safe and trusted autonomous systems, including a focus on collaboration and experimentation.},

abstract = {Hybrid Simulation (HS) is the application of two or more simulation techniques (e.g., ABS, DES, SD) in a single M&amp;S study. Distinct from HS, Hybrid Modelling (HM) is defined as the combined application of simulation approaches (including HS) with methods and techniques from the broader OR/MS literature and also across disciplines. In this paper, we expand on the unified conceptual representation and classification of hybrid M&amp;S, which includes both HS (Model Types A-C), hybrid OR/MS models (D, D.1) and cross-disciplinary hybrid models (Type E), and assess their innovation potential. We argue that model types associated with HM (D, D.1, E), with its focus on OR/MS and cross-disciplinary research, are particularly well-placed in driving innovation in the theory and practice of M&amp;S. Application of these innovative HM methodologies will lead to innovation in the application space as new approaches in stakeholder engagement, conceptual modelling, system representation, V&amp;V, experimentation, etc. are identified.},

abstract = {Robotic systems are increasingly seen as possible technical aids against the background of demographic change and the associated pressures on care systems, with increasing numbers of care recipients and a decreasing number of trained caregivers. In human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work, different design paradigms are currently being pursued to explore which features and appearances are favorable for meaningful interactions of humans with robotic systems. One such approach, labeled as "otherware", proposes to conceptualize robots beyond a naive anthropomorphism or zoomorphism, rather developing the idea of a figure that goes beyond the dichotomy between "being alive" and "being a technical artefact". We present an ethnographic study on the perceptions, attitudes, and practices of care attendants and nursing-home residents in their experimenting with off-the-shelf robotic cats and dogs. The three-week study shows specific appropriation practices of the robotic pets, and how the care attendants - partly together with the residents - define their experiences of the robotic pets, i.e., in which situations the robotic pets are considered either as living beings or as technology toys. The study provides practice-based insights into how possible uses of robotic pets could be meaningfully integrated into care practices, but also which ethical reflections were discussed during their use. Finally, this ethnographic study functioned as a collaborative learning process between researchers, care attendants, and residents, and thus also points out possible aspects that arose with regard to future learning spaces of professional and organizational development for dealing with innovative technologies in residential care contexts.},

abstract = {This systematic mapping review sheds light on how emerging technologies have been introduced and taught in various K–12 learning settings, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). These technologies are rapidly being integrated into children's everyday lives, but their functions and implications are rarely understood due to their complex and distributed nature. The review provides a rigorous overview of the state of the art based on 107 records published across the fields of human-computer interaction, learning sciences, computing education, and child–computer interaction between 2010 and 2020.&nbsp;The findings show the urgent need on a global scale for inter- and transdisciplinary research that can integrate these dispersed contributions into a more coherent field of research and practice. The article presents nine discussion points for developing a shared agenda to mature the field. Based on the HCI community's expertise in human-centred approaches to technology and aspects of learning, we argue that the community is ideally positioned to take a leading role in the realisation of this future research agenda.},

abstract = {Youth regularly use technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is increasingly well-known that AI can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly involved in decision making in high-stakes domains, including loan applications, employment screening, and assistive clinical decision making. Meanwhile, involving AI in these high-stake decisions has created ethical concerns on how to balance different trade-offs to respect human values. One approach for aligning AIs with human values is to elicit human ethical preferences and incorporate this information in the design of computer systems. In this work, we explore how human ethical preferences are impacted by the information shown to humans during elicitation. In particular, we aim to provide a contrast between verifiable information (e.g., patient demographics or blood test results) and predictive information (e.g., the probability of organ transplant success). Using kidney transplant allocation as a case study, we conduct a randomized experiment to elicit human ethical preferences on scarce resource allocation to understand how human ethical preferences are impacted by the verifiable and predictive information. We find that the presence of predictive information significantly changes how humans take into account other verifiable information in their ethical preferences. We also find that the source of the predictive information (e.g., whether the predictions are made by AI or human doctors) plays a key role in how humans incorporate the predictive information into their own ethical judgements.},

abstract = {Adolescent online safety researchers have emphasized the importance of moving beyond restrictive and privacy invasive approaches to online safety, towards resilience-based approaches for empowering teens to deal with online risks independently. Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to teens' personal experiences online; thus, they do not effectively cater to the unique needs of teens. To better understand how we might design online safety interventions that help teens deal with online risks, as well as when and how to intervene, we must include teens as partners in the design process and equip them with the skills needed to contribute equally to the design process. As such, we conducted User Experience (UX) bootcamps with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first teach them important UX design skills using industry standard tools, so they could create storyboards for unsafe online interactions commonly experienced by teens and high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for dealing with these situations. Based on their storyboards, teens often encountered information breaches and sexual risks with strangers, as well as cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While teens often blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with responding to risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice from others on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did not find any of the existing ways for responding to these risks to be effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their own design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned "nudges" that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the victim) to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from occurring, or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior to prevent it from happening again in the future. Teens also designed personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the ability to manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens also designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help them know how to handle online risks themselves without intervention from their parents. Our findings highlight how teens want to address online risks "at the root" by putting the onus of risk prevention on those who perpetrate them - rather than on the victim. Our work is the first to leverage co-design with teens to develop novel online safety interventions that advocate for a paradigm shift from youth risk protection to promoting good digital citizenship.},

More than six months of informed investigation and analysis resulted in an ambitious redesign of the web site, which launched in October 1999. The aquarium and AlbenFaris worked in close partnership in a collaborative development process that included visitor research, establishment of a clear strategic vision, a set of goals and content objectives, identification of target audiences, scenario planning, competitive analysis, site definition and design. As a result, the new E-Quarium exemplifies the relevance of grounded design practice.More than a design case study, this is a thoughtful weaving of the process, perspectives and experiences the designers gained from understanding the aquariums structure, mission and culture and the needs of the aquariums key audiences. The inclusion of experts in marine biology and conservation, exhibition design and technology as members of the development team provided inspiration and insights beyond the normal boundaries of interactive design.This presentation is also a journey into the wonder of kelp forests and the deep sea-habitats showcased in the aquarium exhibits and the online E-Quarium. Both the physical aquarium and the E-Quarium have a profound effect on visitors, inspiring and informing them about the wonders of the oceans. And both serve as catalysts, making visitors aware of ocean conservation issues and encouraging them to join with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the cause of ocean conservation.},

Our RoboTIPS study sets out to design and trial an innovative design feature that will advance the safe operation of social robots and foster societal trust. The Ethical Black Box (EBB) collects data about a robot's actions in real time and in context; when an incident occurs, this data can be used within a wider investigation process to determine what went wrong and prevent similar adverse events. In this paper we draw on Lucy Suchman's groundbreaking work on human-machine relationships to elucidate the goals, practices and potential impact of our study. We align with Suchman's positioning of safety as an accomplishment of situated action and draw on her analysis to describe the actions of the EBB-enhanced social robot as contingent on context and the robot's status as a social agent. We also describe shared priorities in our methodological approaches. We close with observations on how participatory design and an ethnomethodologically-informed stance towards data collection and analysis can contribute to the field of responsible innovation (RI), which seeks to ensure that innovations are undertaken in the public interest and provide societal value.},

abstract = {Real-time collaboration between a requester and crowd workers expands the scope of tasks that crowdsourcing can be used for by letting requesters and crowd workers interactively create various artifacts (e.g., a sketch prototype, writing, or program code). In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups. Finally, we make design recommendations that can inform the design of future real-time collaboration processes in crowdsourcing systems.},

abstract = {The use of AI and other algorithms in resource-constrained public sector settings of the developing world face unique technical and social challenges. The organizational and institutional realities of the public sector such as legacy data/IT systems, embedded work culture, bureaucratic norms and resource-constraints both explicitly and implicitly shape deliberation, design and deployment of public sector data science projects. Through the case of algorithmic rural road planning in a large-scale government program in India, our work demonstrates how algorithms can be positively utilized within the context of constrained capacities and choices. As practitioners deeply involved in the entire project life-cycle, our action-research provides an intimate and reflective account of how production of even seemingly “simple” algorithmic projects pose non-trivial complexities and challenges in the public sector. We situate the conversation around the humans-in-the-loop in our setting and show how public sector characteristics impact participatory design, choice of interfaces, data inequities and algorithm design. Further, we show how the preparation and production of technology by constrained capacities can be counter-productive and detrimental even before the technology is put to use. This further expands the scope of the debate concerning the use of public sector algorithms. Understanding the nuances, practices and constraints in production of data science in the public sector will not only allow more responsible production of data sciences, but also help formulate realistic strategies to mitigate the risks involved in the use of algorithms in high-stakes public policy situations.},

However, the complicated nature of a community’s goals and needs, as well as the complexity of AI’s development procedures, outputs, and potential impacts, often prevents effective participation. In this paper, we present the Model Card Authoring Toolkit, a toolkit that supports community members to understand, navigate and negotiate a spectrum of machine learning models via deliberation and pick the ones that best align with their collective values. Through a series of workshops, we conduct an empirical investigation of the initial effectiveness of our approach in two online communities – English and Dutch Wikipedia, and document how our participants collectively set the threshold for a machine learning based quality prediction system used in their communities’ content moderation applications. Our results suggest that the use of the Model Card Authoring Toolkit helps improve the understanding of the trade-offs across multiple community goals on AI design, engage community members to discuss and negotiate the trade-offs, and facilitate collective and informed decision-making in their own community contexts. Finally, we discuss the challenges for a community-centered, deliberation-driven approach for AI design as well as potential design implications.},

abstract = {Online dating is a space where autistic individuals can find romantic partners with reduced social demands. Autistic individuals are often expected to adapt their behaviors to the social norms underlying the online dating platform to appear as desirable romantic partners. However, given that their autistic traits can lead them to different expectations of dating, it is uncertain whether conforming their behaviors to the norm will guide them to the person they truly want. In this paper, we explored the perceptions and expectations of autistic adults in online dating through interviews and workshops. We found that autistic people desired to know whether they behaved according to the platform’s norms. Still, they expected to keep their unique characteristics rather than unconditionally conform to the norm. We conclude by providing suggestions for designing inclusive online dating experiences that could foster self-guided decisions of autistic users and embrace their unique characteristics.},

abstract = {Especially in ill-defined problems like complex, real-world tasks more than one way leads to a solution. Until now, the evaluation of information visualizations was often restricted to measuring outcomes only (time and error) or insights into the data set. A more detailed look into the processes which lead to or hinder task completion is provided by analyzing users' problem solving strategies. A study illustrates how they can be assessed and how this knowledge can be used in participatory design to improve a visual analytics tool. In order to provide the users a tool which functions as a real scaffold, it should allow them to choose their own path to Rome. We discuss how evaluation of problem solving strategies can shed more light on the users' "exploratory minds".},

abstract = {Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is an efficient way for non-experts to teach new skills to a robot. PbD can be carried out in different ways, for instance, by kinesthetic guidance, teleoperation or by using external controls. In this paper, we compare these three ways of controlling a robot in terms of efficiency, effectiveness (success and error rate) and usability. In an industrial assembly scenario, 51 participants carried out peg-in-hole tasks using one of the three control modalities. The results show that kinesthetic guidance produces the best results. In order to test whether the problems during teleoperation are due to the fact that users cannot, like in kinesthetic guidance, switch between control points using traditional teleoperation devices, we designed a new device that allows users to switch between controls for large and small movements. A user study with 15 participants shows that the novel teleoperation device yields almost as good results as kinesthetic guidance.},

This is due to the results from UX research activities that are not perceived to be impactful by developers, designers and other stakeholders in digital transformation projects especially by the government that has been suffering from vendor-centric Request for Proposal (RFP) tender for the past 60 years. In consequences, time taken by developers to code from requirements captured by business analysts is longer than visual representation produced by UX or UI designers, which shortens the requirement gathering process. In conclusion, we found that UX sketching that produces visual representation of user needs to be effective especially in participatory design approach and to reduce user frustrations.},

abstract = {Given a growing concern about the lack of ethical consideration in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, many have begun to question how dominant approaches to the disciplinary education of computer science (CS)---and its implications for AI---has led to the current "ethics crisis". However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of "exclusionary pedagogy," where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as "ethical unicorns" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education.},

abstract = {Algorithmic audits (or ‘AI audits’) are an increasingly popular mechanism for algorithmic accountability; however, they remain poorly defined. Without a clear understanding of audit practices, let alone widely used standards or regulatory guidance, claims that an AI product or system has been audited, whether by first-, second-, or third-party auditors, are difficult to verify and may potentially exacerbate, rather than mitigate, bias and harm. To address this knowledge gap, we provide the first comprehensive field scan of the AI audit ecosystem. We share a catalog of individuals (N=438) and organizations (N=189) who engage in algorithmic audits or whose work is directly relevant to algorithmic audits; conduct an anonymous survey of the group (N=152); and interview industry leaders (N=10). We identify emerging best practices as well as methods and tools that are becoming commonplace, and enumerate common barriers to leveraging algorithmic audits as effective accountability mechanisms. We outline policy recommendations to improve the quality and impact of these audits, and highlight proposals with wide support from algorithmic auditors as well as areas of debate. Our recommendations have implications for lawmakers, regulators, internal company policymakers, and standards-setting bodies, as well as for auditors. They are: 1) require the owners and operators of AI systems to engage in independent algorithmic audits against clearly defined standards; 2) notify individuals when they are subject to algorithmic decision-making systems; 3) mandate disclosure of key components of audit findings for peer review; 4) consider real-world harm in the audit process, including through standardized harm incident reporting and response mechanisms; 5) directly involve the stakeholders most likely to be harmed by AI systems in the algorithmic audit process; and 6) formalize evaluation and, potentially, accreditation of algorithmic auditors.},

In this paper, we explore in particular how information about a person's emotions can be communicated to the agent with means of non-verbal communication through tangible interfaces. The purpose is to explore how different individuals approach the task of designing their own tangible interfaces for communicating emotions with a digital companion, and the range of different preferences and expectations. Six participants were interviewed and created tangible prototypes during a co-creation workshop. The data was analysed using theories about human emotions and activity, and translated into a generic user model, an architecture for a multiagent system and interface design proposals. The results include increased understanding of how different individuals would like to express their emotions with tangible interfaces, and informed the design of the information models regarding representing emotions. The study illuminated the importance of personalisation of functionality and interface design to address the diversity among individuals, as well as the design of the adaptive behaviour of a digital companion. Future work includes further studies involving additional participants, the development of the stress management application and conducting user studies where prototypes are used in daily activities.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, civil litigants in the U.S. have come to increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) systems to classify documents for discovery review and fact-finding, an approach now broadly referred to as Technology-Assisted Review (TAR). The transformation of legal discovery from a painstaking manual process to a sophisticated algorithm-driven methodology took place over a relatively short period of time, many years before controversies arose surrounding the use of automated risk assessment tools on the criminal side of the U.S. justice system. Introduced in 2008 to a handful of litigators in an experimental research setting hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), TAR was first deployed live on an active litigation in 2012, and by 2015 a vocal and influential vanguard of judges was actively advocating for its use on cases involving large, complex document discovery. My research examines the cross-disciplinary experimentation and collaboration that took place across legal practitioners and computer scientists leading to ML becoming a judicially accepted solution in U.S. civil litigation practice. The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive case study for how an expert professional field wrestled with the challenges of integrating ML into sensitive decision-making workflows. While deeply attentive to the unique and complex encounter between U.S. civil litigation practice and computer science, my work also aims to inform the practice of algorithmic system design, development, and governance across other high-stakes professional domains.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. This skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. For example, Kay et al. showed that although 28% of CEOs in the U.S. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for "CEO" in Google Image Search are women. Similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. Most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. These labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. As observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. We develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. It accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this "diversity score" into the final selection process. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 Google Image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known CelebA dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as "smiling" or "glasses". Both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current Google Image Search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. Further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. These empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.},

Robots may enable smooth non face-to-face interactions between medical staff and patients by providing cognitive and physical support to the medical staff. In this paper, we identified the medical staff's pain points and needs about the robots which would help them. In addition, researchers and medical staff together participated in generating the design concept of a robot needed in times of COVID-19 as design participants. We conducted qualitative interviews about robots with nurses working in a negative pressure isolation room (NPIR) where patients with COVID-19 are isolated while treatment. As a result, the needs for supporting increased workload including inventory monitoring, waste management, meal delivery, and medicine delivery as well as supporting communication in emergency including communication in patient's emergency and communication in medical staff's emergency were discovered. Based on the findings from the interview, we proposed a robot design concept that can satisfy medical staff's need in NPIR.},

abstract = {Bringing AI technology into clinical practice has proved challenging for system designers and medical professionals alike. The academic literature has, for example, highlighted the dangers of black-box decision-making and biased datasets. Furthermore, end-users’ ability to validate a system’s performance often disappears following the introduction of AI decision-making. We present the MAP model to understand and describe the three stages through which medical observations are interpreted and handled by AI systems. These stages are Measurement, in which information is gathered and converted into data points that can be stored and processed; Algorithm, in which computational processes transform the collected data; and Presentation, where information is returned to the user for interpretation. For each stage, we highlight possible challenges that need to be overcome to develop Human-Centred AI systems. We illuminate our MAP model through complementary case studies on colonoscopy practice and dementia diagnosis, providing examples of the challenges encountered in real-world settings. By defining Human-AI interaction across these three stages, we untangle some of the inherent complexities in designing AI technology for clinical decision-making, and aim to overcome misalignment between medical end-users and AI researchers and developers.},

abstract = {Menopause is a natural part of women's aging, but is often accompanied by an increased cardiometabolic risk (CMR), of which most women are unaware. Preventive self-care via mobile health applications (apps) is a promising way to address this issue, but research on apps for middle-aged women is limited. Further, modeling such risk is no trivial task in a non-clinical self-care context, where most biomarkers used in traditional models are unavailable. Machine learning (ML) is a potential option in this regard, but many ML approaches are effectively black box models, which leads to doubt regarding their trustworthiness. Therefore, in this paper we analyze and compare different decision tree and rule-based classification models, considered to be inherently interpretable, to assess the CMR of early middle-aged women in the context of a non-clinical self-care app. For this, we first defined a set of candidate determinants based on the feedback of potential users and domain experts. We then used data from a subset of the participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to compare these ML models with traditional risk score models, based on five cardiometabolic 10-year outcomes: heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.},

We investigated the approaches to annotator diversity through 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 44 AI/ML practitioners. While practitioners described nuanced understandings of annotator diversity, they rarely designed dataset production to account for diversity in the annotation process. The lack of action was explained through operational barriers: from the lack of visibility in the annotator hiring process, to the conceptual difficulty in incorporating worker diversity. We argue that such operational barriers and the widespread resistance to accommodating annotator diversity surface a prevailing logic in data practices—where neutrality, objectivity and ‘representationalist thinking’ dominate. By understanding this logic to be part of a regime of existence, we explore alternative ways of accounting for annotator subjectivity and diversity in data practices.},

abstract = {In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.},

Despite the inclusion of dignity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, like many other AI ethics principles, there is little operational understanding of what dignity can look like in practice when it comes to the development of algorithms. Drawing on cybernetics and a model of dignity developed in the field of international conflict resolution, this paper presents our work-in-progress tool - the Dignity Lens - for considering dignity throughout the AI development lifecycle, and practitioner reflections from using the tool. This work is an initial step towards articulating what dignity-centred AI development could look like in practice, assisting practitioners designing and developing algorithms to actively consider dignity.},

abstract = {English: With the increasing attention non-binary people receive in Western societies, strategies of gender-fair language have started to move away from binary (only female/male) concepts of gender. Nevertheless, hardly any approaches to take these identities into account into machine translation models exist so far. A lack of understanding of the socio-technical implications of such technologies risks further reproducing linguistic mechanisms of oppression and mislabelling. In this paper, we describe the methods and results of a workshop on gender-fair language and language technologies, which was led and organised by ten researchers from TU Wien, St. P\"{o}lten UAS, FH Campus Wien and the University of Vienna and took place in Vienna in autumn 2021. A wide range of interest groups and their representatives were invited to ensure that the topic could be dealt with holistically. Accordingly, we aimed to include translators, machine translation experts and non-binary individuals (as “community experts”) on an equal footing. Our analysis shows that gender in machine translation requires a high degree of context sensitivity, that developers of such technologies need to position themselves cautiously in a process still under social negotiation, and that flexible approaches seem most adequate at present. We then illustrate steps that follow from our results for the field of gender-fair language technologies so that technological developments can adequately line up with social advancements. Deutsch: Mit zunehmender gesamtgesellschaftlicher Wahrnehmung nicht-bin\"{a}rer Personen haben sich in den letzten Jahren auch Konzepte von genderfairer Sprache von der bisher verwendeten Binarit\"{a}t (weiblich/m\"{a}nnlich) entfernt. Trotzdem gibt es bislang nur wenige Ans\"{a}tze dazu, diese Identit\"{a}ten in maschineller \"{U}bersetzung abzubilden. Ein fehlendes Verst\"{a}ndnis unterschiedlicher sozio-technischer Implikationen derartiger Technologien birgt in sich die Gefahr, fehlerhafte Ansprachen und Bezeichnungen sowie sprachliche Unterdr\"{u}ckungsmechanismen zu reproduzieren. In diesem Beitrag beschreiben wir die Methoden und Ergebnisse eines Workshops zu genderfairer Sprache in technologischen Zusammenh\"{a}ngen, der im Herbst 2021 in Wien stattgefunden hat. Zehn Forscher*innen der TU Wien, FH St. P\"{o}lten, FH Campus Wien und Universit\"{a}t Wien organisierten und leiteten den Workshop. Dabei wurden unterschiedlichste Interessensgruppen und deren Vertreter*innen breit gestreut eingeladen, um sicherzustellen, dass das Thema holistisch behandelt werden kann. Dementsprechend setzten wir uns zum Ziel, Machine-Translation-Entwickler*innen, \"{U}bersetzer*innen, und nicht-bin\"{a}re Privatpersonen (als “Lebens-welt-Expert*innen”) gleichberechtigt einzubinden. Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass Geschlecht in maschineller \"{U}bersetzung eine ma\ss{}geblich kontextsensible Herangehensweise erfordert, die Entwicklung von Sprachtechnologien sich vorsichtig in einem sich noch in Aushandlung befindlichen gesellschaftlichen Prozess positionieren muss, und flexible Ans\"{a}tze derzeit am ad\"{a}quatesten erscheinen. Wir zeigen auf, welche n\"{a}chsten Schritte im Bereich genderfairer Technologien notwendig sind, damit technische mit sozialen Entwicklungen mithalten k\"{o}nnen.},

Robots have been proposed to help engage older adults in physical activity (PA), albeit with limited success. There is a lack of robust understanding of older adults' needs and wants from robots designed to engage them in PA. In this paper, we report on the findings of a co-design process where older adults, physical therapy experts, and engineers designed robots to promote PA in older adults. We found a variety of motivators for and barriers against PA in older adults; we, then, conceptualized a broad spectrum of possible robotic support and found that robots can play various roles to help older adults engage in PA. This exploratory study elucidated several overarching themes and emphasized the need for personalization and adaptability. This work highlights key design features that researchers and engineers should consider when developing robots to engage older adults in PA, and underscores the importance of involving various stakeholders in the design and development of assistive robots.},

In this paper, we outline the history of our institute against the background of trends in HCI, working out the cornerstones and “useful practices” from our research tradition towards our vision of the future of a human-centred AI/IA, with the expectation that this analysis may be useful for similar organisations. In doing so, we illustrate tensions between theory and application, humans and technology, and show how keeping those aspects in balance is an important challenge and chance for bringing disruptive emerging technologies successfully into practice.},

Thus, foot gestures are an intuitive and natural form of expression for interpersonal interaction. Recent studies have mostly introduced smart shoes as personal gadgets, while foot gestures used in multi-person foot interactions in social scenarios remain largely unexplored. We present Shoes++, which includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-mounted sole and an input vocabulary of social foot-to-foot gestures to support foot-based interaction. The gesture vocabulary is derived and condensed by a set of gestures elicited from a participatory design session with 12 users. We implement a machine learning model in Shoes++ which can recognize two-person and three-person social foot-to-foot gestures with 94.3% and 96.6% accuracies (N=18). In addition, the sole is designed to easily attach to and detach from various daily shoes to support comfortable social foot interaction without taking off the shoes. Based on users' qualitative feedback, we also found that Shoes++ can support team collaboration and enhance emotion expression, thus making social interactions or interpersonal dynamics more engaging in an expanded design space.},

abstract = {Voice assistants (VAs), typically promoted as omniscient conversational butlers, still remain below users’ expectations. Interaction designers seem to struggle bringing in user perspectives necessary to develop more meaningful VA applications beyond simple use cases such as playing music. One of the reasons might be the immateriality of cloud-based VA technology making it difficult to comprehend such complex and ever-evolving systems. In this paper, we investigate provotyping as a design tool for ‘materialising the immaterial’. In our case study, teams of multidisciplinary experts devised twelve provotypes to explore intangible VA technology. We present and discuss three generalisations in respect to the role of provotypes for the exploration of VAs. Our findings show provotypes can serve as the necessary props by which we can bring in missing perspectives around this technology and generate material which enables designers to speculate, debate, and sketch out ideas for meaningful futures of VA applications.},

It has been used by artists as a medium offering 2) creative stimulation to generate material and develop ideas for their work. The Ouija also enables people to express nonconscious knowledge, as research suggests, and thus can provide 3) access to tacit dimension. In this paper, we present the Otherworld Framework that describes its principal elements and provide speculations on how to exploit them in design for collaborative, engaging and unconventional group interactions.},

The key focus of these dashboards is to support better human sense-making and decision-making by visualising data about learners to a variety of stakeholders. Early research on learning analytics dashboards focused on the use of visualisation and prediction techniques and demonstrates the rich potential of dashboards in a variety of learning settings. Present research increasingly uses participatory design methods to tailor dashboards to the needs of stakeholders, employs multimodal data acquisition techniques, and starts to research theoretical underpinnings of dashboards. In this paper, we present these past and present research efforts as well as the results of the VISLA19 workshop on "Visual approaches to Learning Analytics" that was held at LAK19 with experts in the domain to identify and articulate common practices and challenges for the domain.

abstract = {This initial study explores the design of flavor-based cues with older adults for their self-defining memories. It proposes using food to leverage the connections between odor and memory to develop new multisensory memory cues. Working with 4 older adults, we identified 6 self-defining autobiographical memories for each participant, 3 related to food, 3 unrelated to food. Flavor-based cues were then created for each memory through a co-design process. Findings indicate the dominance of relationship themes in the identified self-defining memories and that flavor-based cues related mostly to multiple ingredient dishes. We discuss how these findings can support further research and design into flavor-based memory cues through 3D food printing.},

abstract = {Despite impressive performance in many benchmark datasets, AI models can still make mistakes, especially among out-of-distribution examples. It remains an open question how such imperfect models can be used effectively in collaboration with humans. Prior work has focused on AI assistance that helps people make individual high-stakes decisions, which is not scalable for a large amount of relatively low-stakes decisions, e.g., moderating social media comments. Instead, we propose conditional delegation as an alternative paradigm for human-AI collaboration where humans create rules to indicate trustworthy regions of a model. Using content moderation as a testbed, we develop novel interfaces to assist humans in creating conditional delegation rules and conduct a randomized experiment with two datasets to simulate in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our study demonstrates the promise of conditional delegation in improving model performance and provides insights into design for this novel paradigm, including the effect of AI explanations.},

Our project aims to provide citizens and community organizers with a better understanding of the legal landscape of police accountability in Allegheny County, allowing them to more effectively advocate for reform. We do so by creating an open collaborative network that works to overcome the issues of data inaccessibility, data complexity, and the fragmentation of data across different municipalities. We engaged with community leaders, gathered contracts and other data on over 100 police departments in Allegheny County, and created a web platform to make this previously inaccessible information available to the public. In its creation, we also utilized visual representation to aid those engaging with the law to better understand and collaborate without being inhibited by complicated legal concepts.},

In this paper, we present clinicians' perspectives on the prospective benefits and harms of voice data collection during health consultations. Such data collection is being proposed as a means to power models to assist clinicians with medical data entry, administrative tasks, and consultation analysis. Yet, clinicians' attitudes and concerns are largely absent from the AI narratives surrounding these use cases, and the academic literature investigating them. Our qualitative interview study used the concept of an informed consent process as a type of design fiction, to support elicitation of clinicians' perspectives on voice data collection and use associated with a fictional, near-term AI assistant. Through reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth sessions with physicians, we distilled eight classes of potential risks that clinicians are concerned about, including workflow disruptions, self-censorship, and errors that could impact patient eligibility for services. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of these prospective risks, reflect on the use of the speculative processes that illuminated them, and reconsider evaluation criteria for AI-assisted clinical documentation technologies in light of our findings.},

There is a limited understanding of how AI may perform in group decision-making. This paper presents a wizard-of-oz study in which two participants and an AI form a committee to rank three English essays. One novelty of our study is that we adopt a speculative design by endowing AI equal power to humans in group decision-making. We enable the AI to discuss and vote equally with other human members. We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions. Moreover, the divergent opinions of our participants regarding an “equal AI” shed light on the possible future of human-AI relations.},

Via three vignettes, we discuss how considering the possible effects of trauma and traumatic stress reactions provides an explanatory lens with new insights into people’s technology experiences. Then, we present a framework—trauma-informed computing—in which we adapt and show how to apply six key principles of trauma-informed approaches to computing: safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, enablement, and intersectionality. Through specific examples, we describe how to apply trauma-informed computing in four areas of computing research and practice: user experience research &amp; design, security &amp; privacy, artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning, and organizational culture in tech companies. We conclude by discussing how adopting trauma-informed computing will lead to benefits for all users, not only those experiencing trauma.},

abstract = {This paper draws attention to new complexities of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to sensitive contexts, such as welfare allocation. AI is increasingly used in public administration with the promise of improving decision-making through predictive modelling. To accurately predict, it needs all the agreed criteria used as part of decisions, formal and informal. This paper empirically explores the informal classifications used by caseworkers to make unemployed welfare seekers 'fit' into the formal categories applied in a Danish job centre. Our findings show that these classifications are documentable, and hence traceable to AI. However, to the caseworkers, they are at odds with the stable explanations assumed by any bureaucratic recording system as they involve negotiated and situated judgments of people's character. Thus, for moral reasons, caseworkers find them ill-suited for formal representation and predictive purposes and choose not to write them down. As a result, although classification work is crucial to the job centre's activities, AI is denuded of the real-world (and real work) character of decision-making in this context. This is an important finding for CSCW as it is not only about whether AI can 'do' decision-making in particular contexts, as previous research has argued. This paper shows that problems may also be caused by people's unwillingness to provide data to systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the empirical results of this research, followed by a discussion of implications for AI-supported practice and research.},

Leveraging advanced computer vision, ARMath recognizes everyday objects, visualizes their mathematical attributes, and turns them into tangible or virtual manipulatives. Using the manipulatives, children can solve problems that situate math operations or concepts in specific everyday contexts. Informed by four participatory design sessions with teachers and children, we developed five ARMath modules to support basic arithmetic and 2D geometry. We also conducted an exploratory evaluation of ARMath with 27 children (ages 5-8) at a local children's museum. Our findings demonstrate how ARMath engages children in math learning, how failures in AI can be used as learning opportunities, and challenges that children face when using ARMath.},

Given that India is a multilingual country (22 official languages), a uniform framework for an integrated text-to-speech synthesis systems with screen readers across six Indian languages are developed, which can be easily extended to other languages as well. Since Indian languages are syllable centred, syllable-based concatenative speech synthesizers are built.This paper describes the development and evaluation of syllable-based Indian language Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system (around festival TTS) with ORCA and NVDA, for Linux and Windows environments respectively. TTS systems for six Indian Languages, namely, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Telugu were built. Usability studies of the screen readers were performed. The system usability was evaluated by a group of visually challenged people based on a questionnaire provided to them. And a Mean Opinion Score(MoS) of 62.27% was achieved.},

However, AAC devices do not support nonverbal communication, which allows people to take turns, regulate conversation dynamics, and express intentions. Nonverbal communication requires motion, which is often challenging for AAC users to produce due to motor constraints. In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as ''sidekicks,'' might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers' goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing. We show how these parameters manifest in appearance and behavior and how they can guide future designs for augmented nonverbal communication.},

abstract = {Many researchers have started to explore natural interaction scenarios for children. No matter if these children are normally developing or have special needs, evaluating Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) is a challenge. To find methods that work well and provide reliable data is difficult, for example because commonly used methods such as questionnaires donot work well particularly with younger children. Previous research has shown that children need support in expressing how they feel about technology. Given this, researchers often choose time-consuming behavioral measures from observations to evaluate CRI. However, these are not necessarily comparable between studies and robots.This workshop aims to bring together researchers from differentdisciplines to share their experiences on these aspects. The main topics are methods to evaluate child-robot interaction design, methods to evaluate socially assistive child-robot interaction and multi-modal evaluation of child-robot interaction.Connected questions that we would like to tackle are for example: i) What are reliable metrics in CRI' ii) How can we overcome the pitfalls of survey methods in CRI' iii) How can we integrate qualitative approaches in CRI' iv) What are the best practices for in the wild studies with children? Looking across disciplinary boundaries, we want to discuss advantages and short-comings of using different evaluation methods in order to compile guidelines for future CRI research.

abstract = {The development of ontologies is traditionally a process of building vocabularies and understanding complexities of a specific domain to link data and infer knowledge. However, this method does not always include the domain experts throughout the entire development process. This paper presents a Co-design framework as a structured methodology for ontology design and development. The framework, known as the Co-Designing Ontologies Methodology (C-DOM), presents a strategy to draw knowledge from the Subject Matter Expert (SME) without the SME needing to know any-thing about how to create an ontology. The C-DOM framework outlines a series of workshops that align to the layers of the Semantic Technologies architecture and has been developed via an iterative design process and tested in different domains with different levels of complexity and purpose.

abstract = {Giving presents can have a positive impact upon the giver's mental well-being [1-4]. We wonder whether giving a present to an AI agent could have the same effect. We investigate this question in the context of video games with non-player characters (NPCs), because the rapid expansion of the game industry makes NPCs one of the most common ways in which we experience AI agents. We seek to understand whether players benefit mentally by giving gifts to NPCs in video games. We intend to observe the behaviour of players and measure their psychological changes through a specially designed video game providing them with mechanisms for gifting to NPCs. We have taken an understanding of gifting from the real world and applied this understanding within a game. The game development has been an iterative process of design-build-playtest. Such a process helps us better understand the research space and to better describe the questions. This article reports the latest findings from the game development after playtesting with 12 participants.},

abstract = {Algorithms processing data from wearable sensors promise to more accurately predict risks of falling -- a significant concern for older adults. Substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. We present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. A participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. We then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. We also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.},

A major part of the project has been the iterative, participatory design of a new RDF/S Knowledge Base to store data and metadata relating to the UK’s museums, and a Web Application for the project’s humanities scholars to browse, search, and visualise the data to investigate their research questions.

abstract = {Because algorithm audits are conducted by technical experts, audits are necessarily limited to the hypotheses that experts think to test. End users hold the promise to expand this purview, as they inhabit spaces and witness algorithmic impacts that auditors do not. In pursuit of this goal, we propose end-user audits-system-scale audits led by non-technical users-and present an approach that scaffolds end users in hypothesis generation, evidence identification, and results communication. Today, performing a system-scale audit requires substantial user effort to label thousands of system outputs, so we introduce a collaborative filtering technique that leverages the algorithmic system's own disaggregated training data to project from a small number of end user labels onto the full test set. Our end-user auditing tool, IndieLabel, employs these predicted labels so that users can rapidly explore where their opinions diverge from the algorithmic system's outputs. By highlighting topic areas where the system is under-performing for the user and surfacing sets of likely error cases, the tool guides the user in authoring an audit report. In an evaluation of end-user audits on a popular comment toxicity model with 17 non-technical participants, participants both replicated issues that formal audits had previously identified and also raised previously underreported issues such as under-flagging on veiled forms of hate that perpetuate stigma and over-flagging of slurs that have been reclaimed by marginalized communities.},

We propose a real-time image-text retrieval system for edge-end servers with low-power AI accelerator cards. The procedure is conspicuously sped up by selectively placing part of the deep learning calculation on accelerator devices with a heterogeneous collaborative computation scheme. We also design a lightweight GCN optimization method, which directly transfers the correlation between the image detection areas in projection to reduce computational redundancy. Our other contributions include performance analyses of models with different weights for industrial reference in practical applications. It is the first GCN-based image-text retrieval system to perform a real-time end-to-end search to the best of our knowledge. Experiments show that the system can process 20 image-to-text retrievals per second with high accuracy.},

We perform an extensive evaluation with 50 participants to show the effectiveness of VIMES for memory recall. VIMES outperforms (90% memory accuracy) other traditional methods such as self-recall (34%) while offering the best memory experience (Vividness, Coherence, and Visual Perspective all score over 4/5).

At the same time, they can be abused to engage in cyberbullying, which can cause significant psychological harm to those affected. Thus, with the growth in multimodal communication platforms, there is an urgent need to devise multimodal methods for cyberbullying detection and prevention. However, there are no existing approaches that use automated audio and video analysis to complement textual analysis. Based on the analysis of a human-labeled cyberbullying data-set of Vine "media sessions' (six-second videos, with audio, and corresponding text comments), we report that: 1) multiple audio and visual features are significantly associated with the occurrence of cyberbullying, and 2) audio and video features complement textual features for more accurate and earlier cyberbullying detection. These results pave the way for more effective cyberbullying detection in emerging multimodal (audio, visual, virtual reality) social interaction spaces.},

Collaborative interfaces attempt to realign the roles, making the participants collaborators in solving the person's problem. This paper describes Writer's Aid, a system that deploys AI planning techniques to enable it to serve as an author's collaborative assistant. Writer's Aid differs from previous collaborative interfaces in both the kinds of actions the system partner takes and the underlying technology it uses to do so. While an author writes a document, Writer's Aid helps in identifying and inserting citation keys and by autonomously finding and caching potentially relevant papers and their associated bibliographic information from various on-line sources. This autonomy, enabled by the use of a planning system at the core of Writer's Aid, distinguishes this system from other collaborative interfaces. The collaborative design and its division of labor result in more efficient operation: faster and easier writing on the user's part and more effective information gathering on the part of the system. Subjects in our laboratory user study found the system effective and the interface intuitive and easy to use.},

To do so, we analyze the need for four vision skills--object recognition, text recognition, color recognition, and counting--on over 27,000 visual questions from two datasets representing both scenarios. We next quantify the difficulty of these skills for both humans and computers on both datasets. Finally, we propose a novel task of predicting what vision skills are needed to answer a question about an image. Our results reveal (mis)matches between aims of real users of such services and the focus of the AI community.

abstract = {Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of 'human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for 'critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.},

To date, this has been framed as an image captioning task, where the machine takes an RGB image as input and generates a 2-3 sentence summary of findings as output. The quality of these reports has been canonically measured using metrics from the NLP community for language generation such as Machine Translation and Summarization. However, the evaluation metrics (e.g. BLEU, CIDEr) are inappropriate for the medical domain, where clinical correctness is critical. To address this, our team brought together machine learning experts with radiologists for a pilot study in co-designing a better metric for evaluating the quality of an algorithmically-generated radiology report. The interdisciplinary collaborative process involved multiple interviews, outreach, and preliminary annotation to design a larger scale study - which is now underway - to build a more meaningful evaluation tool.},

abstract = {The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.},

abstract = {The field of Predictive Analytics (PA) provides the possibility to utilize large amounts of data to improve forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and competitive advantage. Especially the transport logistics sector, which is characterized by high business-related uncertainties, time-sensitivity, and volatility, highly benefits from accurate resource and production planning. While success factors and framework conditions of applying PA are well-investigated on a theoretical SCM level, findings on internal and external challenges of transport logistics organizations remain scarce. Therefore, based on a multiple case approach, this study offers in-depth insights into six real-world cases of freight forwarders, ocean carriers, and air carriers. The results uncover both internal and external challenges. From the internal perspective, the biggest challenges are related to the technical implementation including the acquisition of globally generated, internal and external data and its harmonization. In addition, stakeholder management and target setting impede the development of PA. Regarding external challenges, relational and external conditions hamper the application. Therefore, especially actions of third-party institutions in terms of standardization and security enhancements are required. This study contributes to the existing literature in various ways as the systematic identification addresses real-world issues of PA in the neglected but crucial area of transport logistics, discussing urgent research needs and highlighting potential solutions. Additionally, the results offer valuable guidance for managers when implementing PA in transport logistics.},

abstract = {Patient safety errors account for over 400,000 preventable deaths annually in US in hospitals alone, 70% of which are caused by team communication breakdowns, stemming from hierarchical structures and asymmetrical power dynamics between physicians, nurses, patients, and others. Nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and prevent these errors, but they are often penalized for speaking up, particularly when physicians are responsible. Nevertheless, empowering nurses and building strong interdisciplinary teams can lead to improved patient safety and outcomes. Thus, our group has been developing a series of intelligent systems that support teaming in safety critical settings, Robot-Centric Team Support System (RoboTSS), and recently developed a group detection and tracking system for collaborative robots. In this paper, we explore how RoboTSS can be used to empower nurses in interprofessional team settings, through a three month long, collaborative design process with nurses across five US-based hospitals. The main findings and contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we found that participants envisioned using a robotic crash cart to guide resuscitation procedures to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Second, nurses discussed how RoboTSS can generate choreography for efficient spatial reconfigurations in co-located clinical teams, which is particularly important in time-sensitive situations such as resuscitation. Third, we found that nurses want to use RoboTSS to "stop the line," and disrupt power dynamics by policing unsafe physician behavior, such as avoiding safety protocols using a robotic crash cart. Fourth, nurses envisioned using our system to support real-time error identification, such as breaking the sterile field, and then communicating those errors to physicians, to relieve them of responsibility. Finally, based on our findings, we propose robot design implications that capture how nurses envision utilizing RoboTSS. We hope this work promotes further exploration in how to design technology to challenge authority in asymmetrical power relationships, particularly in healthcare, as strong teams save lives.},

abstract = {Facial recognition systems pose numerous ethical challenges around privacy, racial and gender bias, and accuracy, yet little guidance is available for designers and developers. We explore solutions to these challenges in a three-phase design process to create Civil War Twin (CWT), an educational web-based application where users can discover their lookalikes from the American Civil War era (1861--65) while learning more about facial recognition and history. Through this design process, we operationalize a framework for AI literacy, consult with scholars of history, gender, and race, and evaluate CWT in feedback sessions with diverse prospective users. We iteratively formulate design goals to incorporate transparency, inclusivity, speculative design, and empathy into our application. We found that users' perceived learning about the strengths and limitations of facial recognition and Civil War history improved after using CWT, and that our design successfully met users' ethical standards. We also discuss how our ethical design process can be applied to future facial recognition applications.},

abstract = {Accountability is widely understood as a goal for well governed computer systems, and is a sought-after value in many governance contexts. But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners. This map reframes existing discussions around accountability and transparency, using the principle of traceability to show how, when, and why transparency can be deployed to serve accountability goals and thereby improve the normative fidelity of systems and their development processes.},

In response, we reimagine not only how technologies and their models are designed, but also who designs them. We present our work toward developing the concept of gathering as a design process that invites physical prototyping as an important mechanism in developing culturally sustaining technologies. Gathering is inspired by “Hui,” an ‘undefinedlelo Hawai‘i Hawaiian language word translated as: to band together, assemble, organize. We share our ongoing journey of inventing and engaging in gathering and present four characteristics of gathering as a design process.

We introduce an abstract model of social computation that helps capture some of its core research problems more precisely. We explore the potential contribution of multiagent systems technologies to the solution of these problems by exposing the close relationship between social computation and existing methods in multiagent systems. We describe how these methods could be reused in this novel application context, what methodological implications this has, and argue that the resulting cross-fertilisation will be highly beneficial for both sides.},

To make the concept of meaningfulness more graspable, we refer to what Frankl calls the three existentials of life: freedom, responsibility, and noos. We elaborate four dimensions, namely the existentials as an outcome, as their embeddedness in technology, their role in interaction, and their (non-)usage. This is followed by a discussion on the interwovenness of the three existentials as well as their potential impact on HCI research. By that, we aim to contribute to a profound understanding of meaning for HCI, from the epistemological to the methodological perspective, to enable meaning-centered design.},

abstract = {Water supply and drainage systems, which are categorized as critical infrastructure, serve a crucial role in preserving societal health and well-being. Since climate change effects, harsher regulations, population changes, and aging infrastructure pose problems for these systems, the industry is experiencing a digital transition to meet these concerns. This article addresses Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and its application to water distribution networks, combining cyber, physical, and social components for adaptive, responsive, and intelligent management. This paper’s primary contributions include a review of recent security problems in the water industry, which emphasizes the necessity for stronger security measures. The article also examines how water distribution networks, as CPSS, fit into the interrelated realms of physical infrastructure, digital components, and stakeholder involvement, necessitating an all-encompassing system design and management strategy. In addition, the article investigates various cyber-physical attack scenarios, risk management methodologies, and the crucial role of integrated knowledge in mitigating these risks. In the context of increasing digitalization, the paper emphasizes the significance of taking into account both water infrastructure regulations under social space, such as the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD), and cyberspace-related legal and legislative standards, such as the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Cybersecurity Act. By tackling these difficulties and concentrating on privacy concerns, water utilities may contribute to the overall security and resiliency of vital infrastructure while assuring compliance with applicable legislation.},

And YOLOv3 is one of the most popular algorithms in the field of object detection owing to its high performance and efficiency. However, the conventional YOLOv3 algorithm is still too heavy to deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. Consequently, this paper proposes a method to improve the YOLOv3 thus it can be easily deployed to embedded platforms without losing performance. First, substitutes the backbone of YOLOv3, i.e. Darknet53 for MobileNet, which has been proven to be a very efficiency framework for lightweight network. Second, there are numerous redundancies in the detection heads of YOLOv3 and will take a lot of time in the inference process, so we prune the detection heads to a dead-simple structure. Various experiments on our own Power Transmission Line datasets verify our method has state-of-the-art performance while can meet the requirements for deployment to the mobile platforms.},

abstract = {In a collaborative design environment, various software tools are utilized to enhance the product development. This entails a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across these different systems. Semantic interoperability of product information refers to enabling the exchange of design intelligence, including construction history, parameters, features, and constraints. This is a crucial difference compared to current standards such as STEP that deliver "dumb" geometry, where no design intent is associated. To enable semantics data exchange, we propose an ontology-based approach, consisting in developing a "Common Design Features Ontology", called CDFO. Interoperability among ontologies is fulfilled by defining several mapping rules. We use a descriptive logic-based language, notably OWL DL to represent formally our ontology.},

abstract = {The opaque nature of many intelligent systems violates established usability principles and thus presents a challenge for human-computer interaction. Research in the field therefore highlights the need for transparency, scrutability, intelligibility, interpretability and explainability, among others. While all of these terms carry a vision of supporting users in understanding intelligent systems, the underlying notions and assumptions about users and their interaction with the system often remain unclear. We review the literature in HCI through the lens of implied user questions to synthesise a conceptual framework integrating user mindsets, user involvement, and knowledge outcomes to reveal, differentiate and classify current notions in prior work. This framework aims to resolve conceptual ambiguity in the field and enables researchers to clarify their assumptions and become aware of those made in prior work. We further discuss related aspects such as stakeholders and trust, and also provide material to apply our framework in practice (e.g., ideation/design sessions). We thus hope to advance and structure the dialogue on supporting users in understanding intelligent systems.},

Our novel contribution to HCI is to show how community-engagement can surface key technical and social issues and opportunities for more effective speech-based systems. We introduce a bespoke toolkit of technologies and showcase how we utilised the toolkit to engage communities of under-heard language speakers; and, through that engagement process, situate key aspects of ASR development in community contexts. The toolkit consists of (1) an information appliance to facilitate spoken-data collection on topics of community interest, (2) a mobile app to create crowdsourced transcripts of collected data, and (3) demonstrator systems to showcase ASR capabilities and to feed back research results to community members. Drawing on the sensibilities we cultivated through this research, we present a series of challenges to the orthodoxy of state-of-the-art approaches to ASR development.},

However, little to no research on adaptive learning systems or semantic technologies explore personalized experiences based on the various out-of-school experiences and activities of the users. This research investigates the design, development, and evaluation of an ontology-based framework for students' interests in a math word problem generator that may be applied to various other learning systems and possibly other domains. The cohesiveness of the problems in addition to the usability, usefulness, and the short-term effectiveness of the derived technology will be investigated by comparing the generated questions to numerical and traditional Algebra I problems. We aim to better understand students' interests to identify the role that their interests can play in semantic technologies, further supporting the recent advances in ontology-based educational technologies and personalized math word problem generators.},

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

abstract = {Many industries are facing the challenge of how to capture workers’ knowledge such that it can be shared, in particular tacit knowledge. The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines.},

abstract = {As tools for design get increasingly complex and powerful, it is increasingly important that their users have a solid grounding in what it is these tools do and how they do it. When these tools are software engineering tools, we can assume that their users have formal training in computing. However, when the tools are for designing art or multimedia objects, the artists using the tools typically don't have much background in the computing technology they are using. While interdisciplinary design teams can work around the shortcomings of individual team members, they might be more effective teams if they shared a common language and understanding of certain key aspects of the design process. At the University of Washington we have begun a project to study the use of the theory of problem solving as shared knowledge by design teams engaged in creating of multimedia games. The theory we used is derived from early work in artificial intelligence. The concepts of state space, search, operators and evaluation functions are key components of the shared knowledge. The theory is embodied in a software system called T-STAR (Transparent STate-spaces search ARchitecture) which supports a collaborative interface for problem-solving. A key question for the project is "to what extent will interdisciplinary design teams adopt and exploit the theory of problem solving when given an opportunity to do so?"},

abstract = {It has been argued that people are more inclined to accept a robot in their daily lives and even their home, if they have the feeling that the robot's behavior and interaction style matches their characteristics, needs and abilities. The concept of personalization has been introduced in order to create such personal, tailored human-robot interactions (HRI). Personalizing HRI means that robot takes into account individual user characteristics and can adjust its behavior to the situation and the human interaction partner. Previous HRI research indicates that personalization can have positive effects on the user experience during HRI as well as the user's attitudes towards and perceptions of the robot. This workshop is aimed at discussing the value of and exchanging ideas about the concept of personalization for HRI design. More concretely, we want to explore tools, methods and processes for appropriate robot behavior design and interaction modelling for personalized HRI. The workshop uses interactive, creative activities inspired by design thinking and participatory design to promote collaboration and co-creation between the participants and to inspire new, innovative perspectives on personalized HRI.},

Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.},

The AI inequality is caused by (1) the technology divide in who has access to AI technologies in gig work; and (2) the data divide in who owns the data in gig work leads to unfair working conditions, growing pay gap, neglect of workers’ diverse preferences, and workers’ lack of trust in the platforms. In this position paper, we argue that a bottom-up approach that empowers individual workers to access AI-enabled work planning support and share data among a group of workers through a network of end-user-programmable intelligent assistants is a practical way to bridge AI inequality in gig work under the current paradigm of privately owned platforms. This position paper articulates a set of research challenges, potential approaches, and community engagement opportunities, seeking to start a dialogue on this important research topic in the interdisciplinary CHIWORK community.},

Designs annotating and describing emotions are categorised as anthropomorphic, abstract, object based, or biomorphic. The paper concludes that teenagers use a variety of visual metaphors to describe emotions, that teenagers use anthropomorphic visual metaphors the most to describe emotions and that teenagers make more use of abstract and biomorphic visual metaphors to describe 'negative' emotions. The effect of materials on designs is analysed, suggesting that teenagers are more likely to create designs describing emotions featuring anthropomorphic visual metaphors when using malleable three-dimensional materials. Suggestions are made for the use of externalisation and personification as part of interactive emotion displays within affective systems. This research will be of value to interaction designers and Child Computer Interaction researchers seeking to understand how teenagers use different visual metaphors to describe different emotions. The contribution of this work is a categorisation of the visual metaphors teenagers use to express different emotions.},

However, the IoT revolution comes along with other so-called disruptive technologies. Making sense of the data gathered through sensors comes along with discussions of AI, Big Data, Machine Learning and other such technological advancements. While a number of projects already address current challenges of exploiting such technological advancements in digital government, the full scope of deploying the disruptive technologies in smart city initiatives requires more research. This paper therefore aims at investigating research needs in successfully implementing and deploying disruptive technologies in smart cities. The paper first analyses existing EU-funded projects concerning the research needs these projects address and/or put forward. Subsequently, a future scenario is developed to demonstrate the potentials of using disruptive technologies in smart cities. Finally, nine research needs (technical and nontechnical) derived from the comparison of existing research needs from the projects and from the future scenario.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9781538685556},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {This paper presents a gesture set for communicating states to novice users from a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) through an elicitation study comparing gestures created by participants recruited from the general public with varying levels of experience with an sUAS. Previous work in sUAS flight paths sought to communicate intent, destination, or emotion without focusing on concrete states such as Low Battery or Landing. This elicitation study uses a participatory design approach from human-computer interaction to understand how novice users would expect an sUAS to communicate states, and ultimately suggests flight paths and characteristics to indicate those states. We asked users from the general public (N=20) to create gestures for seven distinct sUAS states to provide insights for human-drone interactions and to present intuitive flight paths and characteristics with the expectation that the sUAS would have general commercial application for inexperienced users. The results indicate relatively strong agreement scores for three sUAS states: Landing (0.455), Area of Interest (0.265), and Low Battery (0.245). The other four states have lower agreement scores, however even they show some consensus for all seven states. The agreement scores and the associated gestures suggest guidance for engineers to develop a common set of flight paths and characteristics for an sUAS to communicate states to novice users.},

abstract = {Background: Microservices migrations are challenging and expensive projects with many decisions that need to be made in a multitude of dimensions. Existing research tends to focus on technical issues and decisions (e.g., how to split services). Equally important organizational or business issues and their relations with technical aspects often remain out of scope or on a high level of abstraction.Aims: In this study, we aim to holistically chart the decision-making that happens on all dimensions of a migration project towards microservices (including, but not limited to, the technical dimension).Method: We investigate 16 different migration cases in a grounded theory interview study, with 19 participants that recently migrated towards microservices. This study strongly focuses on the human aspects of a migration, through stakeholders and their decisions.Results: We identify 3 decision-making processes consisting of 22 decision-points and their alternative options. The decision-points are related to creating stakeholder engagement and assessing feasibility, technical implementation, and organizational restructuring.Conclusions: Our study provides an initial theory of decisionmaking in migrations to microservices. It also outfits practitioners with a roadmap of which decisions they should be prepared to make and at which point in the migration.},

It draws on sociological accounts of representation and translation to examine one particular case: the application of topic modeling to blogs written by parents of children on the autism spectrum. In doing so, the paper illustrates the kinds of statements that topic models, and other computational techniques, can make on behalf of people. It also articulates some of the potential consequences of such statements. The paper concludes by offering several suggestions about how to address potential harms that can occur when computational models speak on behalf of someone.},

In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users' preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants, 3,625 referents, and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.

While researchers have proposed many AI techniques to lift data scientists’ burden on data preparation and model selection, few have targeted the presentation creation task. Based on the needs identified from a formative study, this paper presents NB2Slides, an AI system that facilitates users to compose presentations of their data science work. NB2Slides uses deep learning methods as well as example-based prompts to generate slides from computational notebooks, and take users’ input (e.g., audience background) to structure the slides. NB2Slides also provides an interactive visualization that links the slides with the notebook to help users further edit the slides. A follow-up user evaluation with 12 data scientists shows that participants believed NB2Slides can improve efficiency and reduces the complexity of creating slides. Yet, participants questioned the future of full automation and suggested a human-AI collaboration paradigm.},

abstract = {Thinking of technology as a design material is appealing. It encourages designers to explore the material’s properties to understand its capabilities and limitations—a prerequisite to generative design thinking. However, as a material, AI resists this approach because its properties only emerge as part of the user experience design. Therefore, designers and AI engineers must collaborate in new ways to create both the material and its application experience. We investigate the co-creation process through a design study with 10 pairs of designers and engineers. We find that design ‘probes’ with user data are a useful tool in defining AI materials. Through data probes, designers construct designerly representations of the envisioned AI experience (AIX) to identify desirable AI characteristics. Data probes facilitate divergent design thinking, material testing, and design validation. Based on our findings, we propose a process model for co-creating AIX and offer design considerations for incorporating data probes in AIX design tools.},

abstract = {Previous work in 3D printing of hand orthotic devices has shown that patients prefer a 3D-printed design over traditional orthotic splints. Despite the possibility to incorporate self-expression when designing for 3D printing, further customization post-printing is not possible. This creates a design iteration process that may require multiple 3D-printed customized orthosis to obtain the final product. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are unique materials for design due to their "origami" nature; that is, their ability to bend when heated. This paper looks at how to harness this ability to create what we propose as Orthorigami: orthotics made using folding techniques. Specifically, the paper explores how to design an aesthetically pleasing, lightweight, simple, easily adjustable, personally customizable Orthorigami device. This paper presents three design cases using Orthorigami. These cases are used as a means to explore the design process of Orthorigami and see if the process provides an improvement on design iteration over its 3D-printed counterparts. The outcome of case studies is used to propose a process that the end-user may use to create a tailored Orthorigami device in a DIY setting.},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.}

With Outpost, users collaboratively author web site information architectures on an electronic whiteboard using physical media (Post-it notes and images), structuring and annotating that information with electronic pens. This interaction is enabled by a touch-sensitive SMART Board augmented with a robust computer vision system, employing a rear-mounted video camera for capturing movement and a front-mounted high-resolution camera for capturing ink. We conducted a participatory design study with fifteen professional web designers. The study validated that Outpost supports information architecture work practice, and led to our adding support for fluid transitions to other tools.},

Within a vast design space with multiple design options, different interaction concepts were explored. One concept is based on gaze, which is tracked using eye tracking technology. It is then indicated if the operator's gaze is on a software identified object and allows an interaction through a secondary input device. To evaluate the concept, a simulator experiment was designed, comparing it to a joystick input. Expert users will complete two equal scenarios using both interaction methods, whilst metrics such as task success are recorded and interviews are conducted, for a balanced analysis of qualitative and quantitative, as well as subjective and objective data.},

abstract = {Geometrical thinking is a life-long skill, yet, despite its importance, geometry teaching and learning is fraught with difficulties. Traditional pen and pencil approaches have failed to address them. In this vein, a conceptual instructional design (ID), namely GeoArt-ID, is proposed as a radically novel, holistic approach to develop geometrical thinking using art as a source for inspiring activity content for learning geometry. The dynamic design of GeoArt-ID is based upon a framework where the synergy of multiple knowledge, i.e., Technological, Didactical, Content (TDCK) knowledge is involved. GeoArt-ID is set within an affective (a-), blended (b-) and collaborative (c-) learning environment, introducing unique quantitative metrics to express the evolution of the learner's geometrical thinking. oese metrics could be derived from the analysis of a collection of a large amount of sensorial biosignals (big data) captured via unobtrusive smart sensors during sensorimotor learning activities. Data-to-knowledge representation, considering the domains of emotion, cognitive, body gesture and geometric tasks, could be achieved via advanced signal processing and machine/deep learning. Consequently, GeoArt-ID can exhibit high adaptability, scaffolding mentally disabled students to perform geometrical thinking and reasoning for all.},

This complexity requires better addressing the situated and interrelated aspects of sensemaking practices and platforms, and how different disciplines and organisations collaborate during a crisis to turn ambiguity into resilience, and complexity into comprehension. We use design research and participatory design methodology to draw on learnings from the Finnish context and response to COVID-19 and other crises. These insights are then used to create design principles that bridge crisis informatics theory with HCI knowledge to create speculative, diegetic artefacts, which embody new practices and platforms that can be used to encourage collaborative sensemaking to tackle complex, large-scale crises and therefore have a positive impact on the resilience of the society.},

Overly clinical therapy games run the risk of being boring, which defeats the purpose of using games to motivate healing in the first place [10, 23]. In this work, we adapt and repurpose an existing immersive virtual reality (iVR) game, Spellcasters, originally designed purely for entertainment for use as a stroke rehabilitation game—which is particularly relevant in the wake of COVID-19, where telehealth solutions are increasingly needed [4]. In preparation for participatory design sessions with stroke survivors, we collaborate with 14 medical professionals to ensure Spellcasters is safe and therapeutically valid for clinical adoption. We present our novel VR sandbox implementation that allows medical professionals to customize appropriate gestures and interactions for each patient’s unique needs. Additionally, we share a co-designed companion app prototype based on clinicians’ preferred data reporting mechanisms for telehealth. We discuss insights about adapting and repurposing entertainment games as serious games for health, features that clinicians value, and the potential broader impacts of applications like Spellcasters for stroke management.},

Our approach strives for supporting a collaborative (programmer-designer) and user-centered design activity. The workbench architecture allows exploration of novel interaction techniques through seamless integration and adaptation of heterogeneous components, high-fidelity rapid prototyping, runtime evaluation and fine-tuning of designed systems. This paper illustrates through the iterative construction of a running example how OpenInterface allows the leverage of existing resources and fosters the creation of non-conventional interaction techniques.},

This communication strategy is called code-mixing, and it has surged with today’s ever-increasing linguistic and cultural diversity. Because of their communication style, multilinguals who use conversational agents have specific needs and expectations which are currently not being met by conversational systems. While research has been undertaken on code-mixing conversational systems, previous works have rarely focused on the code-mixing users themselves to discover their genuine needs. This work furthers our understanding of the challenges faced by code-mixing users in conversational agent interaction, unveils the key factors that users consider in code-mixing scenarios, and explores expectations that users have for future conversational agents capable of code-mixing. This study discusses the design implications of our findings and provides a guide on how to alleviate the challenges faced by multilingual users and how to improve the conversational agent user experience for multilingual users.},

SemanticCollage helps designers to 1) translate vague, visual ideas into search terms; 2) make better sense of and communicate their designs; while 3) not disrupting their creative flow. A structured observation with 12 professional designers demonstrated how semantic labels help designers successfully guide image search and find relevant words that articulate their abstract, visual ideas.

We elaborate this link with an empirical study of AI in the context of decision-making in a street-level bureaucracy: job placement. The study examines caseworkers' perspectives on the use of AI, and contributes to an understanding of bureaucratic decision-making, with implications for integrating AI in caseworker systems. We report findings from a participatory workshop on AI with 35 caseworkers from different types of public services, followed up by interviews with five caseworkers specializing in job placement. The paper contributes an understanding of caseworkers' collaboration around documentation as a key aspect of bureaucratic decision-making practices. The collaborative aspects of casework are important to show because they are subject to process descriptions making case documentation prone for an individually focused AI with consequences for the future of how casework develops as a practice. Examining the collaborative aspects of caseworkers' documentation practices in the context of AI and (potentially) automation, our data show that caseworkers perceive AI as valuable when it can support their work towards management, (strengthen their cause, if a case requires extra resources), and towards unemployed individuals (strengthen their cause in relation to the individual's case when deciding on, and assigning a specific job placement program). We end by discussing steps to support cooperative aspects in AI decision-support systems that are increasingly implemented into the bureaucratic context of public services.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {The need for critically reflecting on the deceptive nature of advanced technologies, such as social robots, is urging academia and civil society to rethink education and the skills needed by future generations. The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.},

The supporting role of a number of single responsibility agents is described and results for a case study indicate that the application of such agents to search-based design scenarios provides efficient, high performance and effective support. The notion of interactive, joint human-computer activity appears to map well to conceptual software design scenarios: focus on superior design concepts and thence to useful and interesting designs provides a natural and effective way of narrowing the population based search. In addition, agents and the human designer appear to interact as cooperative "team players", jointly influencing the evolutionary algorithm based search. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including expanding the scale of implementation of underlying technologies to support distributed, collaborative design.},

Unfortunately, for the 1.8 million Americans with motor impairments who cannot eat without assistance, challenges restrict them from enjoying this pleasant social ritual. In this work, we identify the needs of participants with motor impairments during social dining and how robot-assisted feeding can address them. Using speculative videos that show robot behaviors within a social dining context, we interviewed participants to understand their preferences. Following a community-based participatory research method, we worked with a community researcher with motor impairments throughout this study. We contribute (a) insights into how a robot can help overcome challenges in social dining, (b) design principles for creating robot-assisted feeding systems, (c) and an implementation guide for future research in this area. Our key finding is that robots' unique assistive qualities can address challenges people with motor impairments face during social dining, promoting empowerment and belonging.},

However, the macroscale patterns of users' information practices and their relationship with the design and adoption of VAs have been largely understudied, especially when it comes to older adults (OAs), who stand to benefit greatly from VAs. We conducted a preliminary investigation to understand the role design elements, such as anthropomorphic aspects of VAs, play in OAs' perception of VAs and in OAs' preferences for VAs' participation within their health information practices. Some unexpected findings indicate that the fidelity of anthropomorphic features influences perception in ways that are dependent on the context of the information tasks. This suggests that research on improving the design and increasing the adoption of VAs should factor the interplay between fidelity of VA representation and information context.},

abstract = {As research and industry moves towards large-scale models capable of numerous downstream tasks, the complexity of understanding multi-modal datasets that give nuance to models rapidly increases. A clear and thorough understanding of a dataset’s origins, development, intent, ethical considerations and evolution becomes a necessary step for the responsible and informed deployment of models, especially those in people-facing contexts and high-risk domains. However, the burden of this understanding often falls on the intelligibility, conciseness, and comprehensiveness of the documentation. It requires consistency and comparability across the documentation of all datasets involved, and as such documentation must be treated as a user-centric product in and of itself. In this paper, we propose Data Cards for fostering transparent, purposeful and human-centered documentation of datasets within the practical contexts of industry and research. Data Cards are structured summaries of essential facts about various aspects of ML datasets needed by stakeholders across a dataset’s lifecycle for responsible AI development. These summaries provide explanations of processes and rationales that shape the data and consequently the models—such as upstream sources, data collection and annotation methods; training and evaluation methods, intended use; or decisions affecting model performance. We also present frameworks that ground Data Cards in real-world utility and human-centricity. Using two case studies, we report on desirable characteristics that support adoption across domains, organizational structures, and audience groups. Finally, we present lessons learned from deploying over 20 Data Cards.x},

Various methods have been used at different stages of algorithm development to encourage researchers and designers to consider the potential societal impact of their research. An understudied yet promising area in this realm is using participatory foresight to anticipate these different societal impacts. We employ crowdsourcing as a means of participatory foresight to uncover four different types of impact areas based on a set of governmental algorithmic decision making tools: (1) perceived valence, (2) societal domains, (3) specific abstract impact types, and (4) ethical algorithm concerns. Our findings suggest that this method is effective at leveraging the cognitive diversity of the crowd to uncover a range of issues. We further analyze the complexities within the interaction of the impact areas identified to demonstrate how crowdsourcing can illuminate patterns around the connections between impacts. Ultimately this work establishes crowdsourcing as an effective means of anticipating algorithmic impact which complements other approaches towards assessing algorithms in society by leveraging participatory foresight and cognitive diversity.},

abstract = {Sales property developer interacted with their customer in most conventional ways such as holding a meeting and deliver product knowledge by conversation. PT. GOLDLAND REALTY already uses innovation such as augmented reality to deliver visualization on their property building product knowledge, but the software shows a lack of interaction between sales staff and customer. Around 80% costumers tend to stop using the software within less than 5 minutes, which shows that customers are not enjoying the software enough. This paper proposes a solution which is capable of improving interaction on augmented reality with a user using User Centered Design (UCD) approach to a property developer building. The result showed that by using augmented reality and User Centered Design (UCD) approach, customers experienced more interaction with the software and gain more valuable product information while interacting.},

abstract = {Visual schedules--the use of symbols to represent a series of activities or steps--have been successfully used by caregivers to help children with autism to understand, structure, and predict activities in their daily lives. Building from in-depth fieldwork and participatory design sessions, we developed vSked, an interactive and collaborative visual scheduling system designed for elementary school classrooms. We evaluated vSked in situ in one autism-specific classroom over three weeks. In this paper, we present the design principles, technical solution, and results from this successful deployment. Use of vSked resulted in reductions in staff effort required to use visual supports. vSked also resulted in improvements in the perceived quality and quantity of communication and social interactions in the classroom.},

The framework includes six dimensions: Goal, Communication Genre, Sequencing, Cardinality, Mutability, and Responsiveness. We describe the iterative design process used to create the Framework, as well as three novel prototypes designed to increase social connectedness and social presence in high-latency situations: 1) the InSync app that allows partners to perform activities simultaneously even though they only see proof of their synchronicity later; 2) the After the Beep system that lets users leave IoT messages that are triggered by the recipients; and 3) the Surrogate platform where players play group battle games against "surrogate" artificial intelligence avatars that mimic unavailable individuals. Data from two design workshops validates the usefulness of the framework for generating new solutions to high-latency scenarios.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

We propose boundary conditions to denote such conditions. We explore this issue through interviews with eight participants in a large ongoing health IT project. The aim of the project is to implement a shared electronic health record system for health care services in a region of Norway. Four phenomena are discussed—group discontinuity, informal follow-up meetings, contractual discussions in the participatory activity, and the “parking” of design decisions. For each phenomenon, we reflect on the associated boundary conditions and their effects on participation and user impact. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made to help participatory design scale with the complexities of large-scale projects: (1) make the boundary conditions explicit; (2) plan for reflections on the process; and (3) plan for peer interaction between users.},

The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability---individual rights and systemic governance--- and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.},

abstract = {When a new product is delivered, it seldom meets all customer needs. The mature phase of a product is driven by customer needs. It requires a human-centered development cycle. As a result, the company should be able to listen the voice of its customers. Most industrial companies are driven by engineers and by technology itself. If current technology is to serve all actors of the life cycle of a product, related companies need to change their ways of dealing with maturity. They have to stop being so driven by features and start examining what customers actually do. The concept of customer itself has to be revisited to the point that any person or group who deals with a product (coming from a process) is a customer of those who developed the product. Product maturity and process maturity are usually distinguished. Product maturity is related to end-user satisfaction, i.e., customers. Product maturity deals with user experience. Process maturity is related to designers, developers, maintainers and other actors who have an impact on the making and evolution of the product. Process maturity deals with organizations, communities and teams involved in the production of a product. This paper proposes an integrated approach to product and process maturity that involves the use of active design documents to support the description of what the product is, how it is or should be used, why it is designed the way it is and how much it will cost to customers in terms of performance, safety, comfort and other criteria that may be relevant to the product purpose of use.},

This study focuses on conditions in which remote workers are distracted by factors that disturb, interrupt, or restrict them during their meetings. We aim to explore the various problem situations and user needs. To understand users’ pain points and needs, focus group interviews and participatory design workshops were conducted to learn about participants’ troubled working experiences over the past two years and the solutions they expected. Our study provides a unified framework of distracting factors by which to understand causes of poor user experience and reveals valuable implications to improve videoconferencing experiences.},

To investigate this problem, prior work by Zhang &amp; Wobbrock (2023) developed multimodal interaction techniques in a prototype system called A11yBoard, but their system was limited to a single artboard in a self-contained prototype and was unable to support real-world use. In this work, we present a major extension of A11yBoard that expands upon its initial interaction techniques, addresses numerous real-world issues, and makes it deployable with Google Slides. We describe the new features developed for A11yBoard for Google Slides along with our participatory design process with a blind co-author. We also present two case studies based on real-world deployments showing that participants were able to independently complete slide reading and authoring tasks that were not possible without sighted assistance previously. We conclude with several design guidelines for making accessible digital content creation tools.},

This article mainly focuses on the research of computer-aided furniture design and manufacturing prospects. First, it has made a general understanding of the theory of computer-aided furniture design based on the literature, and then developed the design of the computer-aided furniture design system. The designed system was tested, and the final test results confirmed that the overall evaluation of the system is high. The system's functions and the system's operating interface score above 3, but the system's response time score is low, mainly because the system uses solidworks for 3D modeling.},

The system automatically extracts events from the raw text, formalized as a sequence of temporally ordered predicate-arguments. These events are given to a machine-learner that produces a coarse-grained rating of the story. The results of the machine-learner and the extracted events are then used to generate fine-grained advice for the students.},

abstract = {Computer games are a rich subject for computer science instruction. Unlike many traditional topics in computer science, gaming is inherently interdisciplinary. Developing games requires integration of concepts from computer graphics, artificial intelligence, operating systems, physical simulation, and, for multi-player games, networking and distributed systems. Consequently, a course in computer games offers an opportunity to survey a broad number of subjects in Computer Science while still maintaining a coherent focus on a single subject. In addition to this unique perspective on Computer Science, computer game development is also a topic of great interest to students. In the following I describe a curriculum for a course which surveys Computer Science through the perspective of computer games. This course has been successfully used for two different courses at different institutions. Over the course of this curriculum, students construct a fully functional game. As topics in computer science are covered, functionality related to those topics is implemented in the game. This incremental development provides students with an integrated view of what are traditionally disparate topics in Computer Science.},

Adult participants (n=13) were presented with benign or concerning scenarios involving children interacting with AI technologies. Their brain activation patterns were recorded and analyzed. Preliminary data analysis revealed distinctive patterns in the mPFC region, which justifies future work to fully realize the potential of this method.},

abstract = {The privacy of personal data is a human right that is systematically violated in the computing industry, according to human rights organisations. The vision that technology would help society progress through more computing and more accumulation of personal data is now 30 years old. With the knowledge of today, such a vision would be different. Instead of violating a human right, technologists could use data minimisation as a central pillar of innovation. A compelling amount of evidence shows that the majority of consumers does not feel comfortable with being tracked or profiled. This paper analyses how this vision may be realised through a variety of projects and case examples. The conclusion is that technology without tracking, personal data collection, or personal data analysis, may gradually emerge as the dominant mode of innovation and computing over the next 30 years.},

abstract = {Information portals are usually created to support the integration of migrants into a host country. However, the information-seeking process can be exhausting, cumbersome and even confusing for migrants as they must cope with time-consuming information overload while searching desired information from lists of documents. Chatbots are easy-to-use, natural, and intuitive, and thus could support information-seeking. There is a lack of research that engages and empowers migrants and other stakeholders as co-design participants in chatbot development. We explored how migrants can be empowered in designing a chatbot that supports their social integration. Using a co-design approach, we conducted a series of activities with migrants and other stakeholders (i.e., online questionnaires, empathy probes, surveys, and co-design workshops) to first understand their expectations regarding chatbots, and then co-design a personality-driven chatbot. We found that chatbot personality can drive co-designing a chatbot as design goals, design directions, and design criteria.},

abstract = {Videos are convenient resources for asynchronous learning, but they lack interpersonal interactions found in synchronous classrooms. Due to missed social connectedness, the isolated video-based learners experience low emotional, behavioral, and cognitive engagement. This work presents "Scripted Vicarious Dialogues" (SVD), a technique for engaging students in a pseudo-social experience of witnessing scripted dialogues between virtual characters (teaching assistants and students) around a video. We conducted a participatory design study to derive design guidelines for SVD. The findings indicate the need to distinguish the virtual components and to give students control of the dialogue’s pace. We then implemented an interactive prototype of SVD and evaluated it (N=40) against a non-social, direct-learning baseline. The results show that the preference for SVD versus the baseline is polarized (25 of 40 preferred SVD; no neutral preferences), and those who preferred SVD had significantly higher emotional and behavioral engagement with SVD compared to the baseline.},

Through a participatory-design study with a set of prototypes with different levels of fidelity, we investigated users' perception of WristOrigami in a wide range of applications with the presented features, and summarized a list of common shape configurations. We summarized our findings into seven design recommendations, to inform the future design of foldable smartwatch interactions. We further developed a set of application demonstrations as proofs-of-concept.},

In this work, we conducted seven co-design workshops with six adolescents with ASD over eight months. The team exchanged ideas and communicated through group discussion and drawings. Our findings suggest that: (1) parents, community group and fellow participants play a pivotal role in supporting a longitudinal ASD co-design study and (2) adolescents with ASD are also able to make better design decision over an iterative software design process. These findings should to be considered when engaging adolescents with ASD as co-designers in a software design process.},

abstract = {Motivation -- With collaborative interaction design, formal models have to be used by expert stakeholders in order to work effectively and efficiently. But these formal models should not be discussed with non-expert stakeholders. Therefore, we use non-formal methods which are based on our formal models when we talk to non-expert stakeholders.Research approach --Expert stakeholders have to get a common ground for their discussions. To achieve that common ground, expert stakeholders have to use models, which formalize an interaction they want to design. We develop non-formal methods based on a conceptual model that are easy to apply by non-experts. This way, non-expert stakeholders can allow free play to their thoughts and do not have to adopt formal entities and models. Therefore, the expert can easily interpret the information received from non-expert stakeholders by using the underlying conceptual model.Findings/Design -- Early collaboration with non-expert stakeholders in order to design interaction in a user centered way is important and performed best with a formal model for expert stakeholders and non-formal methods based on these formal models for discussions between expert and non-expert stakeholders.Actually, formal modelling is crucial from our point of view, but we experienced that insisting on it when collaborating with non-experts, leads to insufficient results.Take away message -- Without having formal models in mind, non-formal methods cannot be applied effectively for a collaborative design of interactions. Non-formal methods like an open requirements elicitation in form of workshops or interviews may fail gaining all necessary information if there is no formal model which builds the basis for the non-formal methods. Only with formal models, we are able to plan, lead, and analyze non-formal methods in a way to get optimal results.},

Two of proposed future studies will pivot into evaluating and refining creator moderation design with different platform stakeholders. First, I will explore how audiences and creators recognize creator moderation's compatibility with platform ecosystem (e.g., monetization, recommendation algorithms). Second, I will organize participatory design workshops with stakeholders such as creators, commercial moderators, and audiences to redesign creator moderation to balance different stakeholders’ stakes and platform's top-down moderation efforts. My dissertation aims to contribute to HCI and CSCW fields through the notion of creator moderation and comprehensive design and policy solutions for a safe and sustaining platform ecosystem.},

The TRAceability Process (TRAP) is a process authoring tool for publishing product lifecycle process configurations as a web site for practitioners to access. A key component of the traceability process is the introduction of traceability patterns which provide a standardized mechanism for the visualization and communication of reusable traceability practices.A tool environment supporting the traceability framework is described. The TRAceability Pattern Environment (TRAPEd) is an environment for the structured and collaborative design of a traceability metamodel, process and patterns. Finally we represent the traceability metamodel, process and patterns using Topic Maps (ISO 13250)},

The construction of IUI is not easy and requires the knowledge of different methods, techniques and technologies from many domains (such as, HCI, artificial intelligence, ergonomics, software engineering, etc.). In this way, the existence of a process is an important tool for IUI developers. The literature presents design processes and frameworks for user interface, but most of them do not offer any knowledge regarding the methods, techniques, and technologies that can be used to support the activities involved. Thus, this work proposes a development process for IUIs which offers recommendations about methods, techniques, and technologies.

The focus is on understanding the needs of this user group in a participatory design approach for creative music technologies that allow for tailored accessibility.Outcomes from this research show that many multi-level social interactions surrounding the technology, users, audience, and any third party facilitators exist in the context of 'facilitated performance'. Results suggest that including facilitators in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) could allow for improved accessibility for users with complex disabilities.},

Taking Weinan City in Shaanxi Province, China as an example, this paper uses several social statistical analysis methods to extract the preferences of residents’ space satisfaction; and the suitability of the local residents’ satisfaction with the living space is studied. Using the rhino software and the grasshopper platform to combine quantitative design and genetic algorithm, this paper proposes an interactive design platform to improve residents’ participation in the design stage and reduce residents’ self-demolition and self-construction behavior. This will help improve residents' well-being and reduce pollution and carbon emissions from building consumables. Results show that the platform works well in participatory design by local residents.},

abstract = {The subject of human-computer interaction can serve for motivation of students of computing undergraduate courses, by empowering them in addressing problems of social importance and raising awareness on ethical issues. This is particularly important as there is a recognised lack of professional ethics direction in programs of study in most curricula. In this paper, it is argued that the subject of human-computer interaction is particularly suitable to serve this role, as it can relate to real life situations more easily than other theoretical or more technical subjects. Examples are provided of teaching interventions that relate the students to critical problems, e.g. to evaluate and re-design web sites of social relevance, design technologies for social inclusion, etc. It is argued that through such approaches of teaching human-computer interaction, computing is situated in a socially relevant context, motivating the students and increasing the learning effect of the teaching intervention.},

abstract = {Mobile robotic telepresence (MRP) allows remote users’ access and mobility in a range of local environments. MRP devices have been adopted in societally significant domains such as workplaces, museums, commerce, education, and healthcare, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic to provide accessibility to these spaces when physical attendance was precluded. Although telepresence robots have autonomous systems features such as collision avoidance, they do not typically allow for physical manipulation of the environment, so they have been found to engender limited trustworthiness and have yet to achieve widespread adoption. This work presents a prototype exploring the potential of Augmented Robotic Telepresence (ART) to improve on inclusion, accessibility, and independence provided to remote users of MRP, broadening the space for interaction and participation, by augmenting affordances in the local environment via techniques such as Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and remote actuation. Herein we describe the ART prototype developed thus far, which is built on top of a commercial MRP robot, the Double 3 by Double Robotics; we elaborate on the ART prototype design, its implementation, and current capabilities. Lastly, we describe our research plans, including design workshops with museum stakeholders, and point towards directions for future work.},

To complement our system, we plan to give the students' community the possibility to contribute to the whole system, not only with ideas (e.g., participatory design and user-driven innovation) and data (e.g., crowdsourcing and crowdsensing) but also with sensors to plug-in into the infrastructure and visualization add-ons to represent the gathered data.},

People maintain prosocial behaviors long-term only if they make decisions themselves intrinsically as opposed to forced restrictions. To build systems for effecting positive social purpose in pandemic and environmental concerns, we apply speculative design to create story structures and interactions that promote behaviors for social good. We designed stories and interactions using both plot-based narrative frameworks and character-based machine-learning-generated dialogues for effecting cooperation. We then ran a series of workshops investigating how designers negotiate and collaborate to tell stories for social purpose using a "finish each other's stories" approach. This work illustrates the application of design fiction to promote sustainable behavioral patterns that value societal good.},

abstract = {Love them or hate them, videos are a pervasive format for delivering online education at scale. They are especially popular for computer programming tutorials since videos convey expert narration alongside the dynamic effects of editing and running code. However, these screencast videos simply consist of raw pixels, so there is no way to interact with the code embedded inside of them. To expand the design space of learner interactions with programming videos, we developed Codemotion, a computer vision algorithm that automatically extracts source code and dynamic edits from existing videos. Codemotion segments a video into regions that likely contain code, performs OCR on those segments, recognizes source code, and merges together related code edits into contiguous intervals. We used Codemotion to build a novel video player and then elicited interaction design ideas from potential users by running an elicitation study with 10 students followed by four participatory design workshops with 12 additional students. Participants collectively generated ideas for 28 kinds of interactions such as inline code editing, code-based skimming, pop-up video search, and in-video coding exercises.},

This work seeks to address the deficit in understanding of what features and functionality young children and their parents desire to help with pain management by using co-design, a common approach to exploring participants' imaginations and gathering design requirements. To close this gap, we carried out a co-design workshop involving seven families (with children aged between 4-6 and their parents) to understand their expectations and design preferences for a robot designed for pain management in children. Data were collected from surveys, video and audio recordings, interviews, and field notes. We present the robot prototypes constructed during the workshops and derive several preferences of the children (e.g., zoomorphic shape, distractors and emotional expressions as behaviors). Additionally, we report methodological insights regarding the involvement of young children and their parents in the co-design process. Based on the findings of this co-design study, we discuss personalization as a possible design concept for future child-robot interaction development.},

In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 27 AI ethics toolkits to critically examine how the work of ethics is imagined and how it is supported by these toolkits. Specifically, we examine the discourses toolkits rely on when talking about ethical issues, who they imagine should do the work of ethics, and how they envision the work practices involved in addressing ethics. Among the toolkits, we identify a mismatch between the imagined work of ethics and the support the toolkits provide for doing that work. In particular, we identify a lack of guidance around how to navigate labor, organizational, and institutional power dynamics as they relate to performing ethical work. We use these omissions to chart future work for researchers and designers of AI ethics toolkits.},

This paper proposes a methodology to support AAC of people with motor impairments, using computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable personalized gestural interaction. The methodology was instantiated in a pilot system described in this paper and evaluated by Human-Computer Interaction experts. The evaluation results suggested improvements for the methodology and for the system, and indicated the methodology is feasible to support the design of AAC systems, and that the developed system is promising to support AAC.},

The diagnosis relies on the observation of behavioural symptoms and parent reporting of the developmental history of the child. It requires years of experience and training for identifying these symptoms which could be often misjudged as other mental conditions with similar symptomology. In this work, we propose a robot-assisted diagnostic protocol for the early detection of autism leveraging the onboard sensors of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) and the vast potential of machine learning techniques. The robot assistant's role will be two-fold: (a) supporting the expert in administering the diagnostic procedure and (b) evaluating the behavioural symptoms and reaching a reliable diagnosis. Even though similar studies have been done in the Global North, the challenges posed by the social and cultural diversity of the Indian population is varied and needs to be explored further.},

These struggles are even more pronounced in students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who might face additional difficulties, including interpersonal deficits, organisational challenges, lacking self-advocacy skills and sensory overload. This thesis uses a participatory design process to research how an adaptive, context-aware system could support students with autism in planning their student life, including managing time, tasks, stress and sensory stimulation. The first interviews resulted in a focus on intelligent planning systems with a low-effort interaction design. The design process will incrementally build towards intelligent support for personalised interactive scheduling as well as in-the-moment next-action recommendations that are context-aware and adaptive to data on the user’s stress level and sensory stimulation exposure.},

Whereas Wikipedia currently uses only manual flagging to detect possible bias, our scheme provides a foundation for the automating of bias flagging by improving upon the methodology of annotation schemes in classic sentiment analysis. We also address challenges unique to the task of identifying biased writing within the specific context of Wikipedia's neutrality policy. We perform a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement, which shows that although the agreement scores for intra-sentential tags were relatively low, the agreement scores on the sentence and entry levels were encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively). Based on an analysis of our first implementation of our scheme, we suggest possible improvements to our guidelines, in hope that further rounds of annotation after incorporating them could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of bias within Wikipedia.},

In earlier work, agents need to follow an order of the depth-first traversal of the hypertree to update their belief. Hence, agents need some synchronization with each other and belief updating can only be done in a limited parallel. Especially, belief updating will fail if any communication channels have problems. In this paper, we present an iterative method where multiple agents asynchronously perform belief updating in a complete parallel. Compared to the previous work, the iterative method is simple, self-adaptive and robust.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models. However, a growing body of evidence shows that these algorithms may not serve underprivileged communities well and at times discriminate against them. This is all the more concerning in education as negative outcomes have long-term implications. We propose a systematic process for framing, detecting, documenting, and reporting unfairness risks. The systematic approach’s outcomes are merged into a framework named FairEd, which would help decision-makers to understand unfairness risks along the environmental and analytical fairness dimension. The tool allows to decide (i) whether the dataset contains risks of unfairness; (ii) how the models could perform along many fairness dimensions; (iii) whether potentially unfair outcomes can be mitigated without degrading performance. The systematic approach is applied to a Chilean University case study, where a predicting student dropout model is aimed to build. First, we capture the nuances of the Chilean context where unfairness emerges along income lines and demographic groups. Second, we highlight the benefit of reporting unfairness risks along a diverse set of metrics to shed light on potential discrimination. Third, we find that measuring the cost of fairness is an important quantity to report on when doing the model selection.},

abstract = {This one-day hybrid workshop builds on previous feminist CSCW workshops to explore feminist theoretical and methodological approaches that have provided us with useful tools to see things differently and make space for change. Since its inception over a decade ago, feminist HCI has progressed from the margins to mainstream HCI, with numerous references in the literature. Feminist HCI has also evolved to incorporate other critical HCI practices such as Queer HCI, participatory design, and speculative design. While feminist approaches have grown in popularity and become mainstream, it is getting more difficult to distinguish the feminist emancipatory core from other attempts of developing and improving society in various ways. In this workshop, we therefore want to revisit our feminist roots, where theory is a liberatory and creative practice, motivated by affect, curiosity, and wonder. From this standpoint, we consider which of our feminist tools can make a significant difference today, in a highly datafied world. The goal of this workshop is to; 1) create an inventory of feminist theories and concepts that have had an impact on our work as designers, educators, researchers, and activists; 2) develop a feminist toolbox for the CSCW community to strengthen our feminist literacy.},

abstract = {Context: Evaluating software architectures in uncertain environments raises new challenges, which require continuous approaches. We define continuous evaluation as multiple evaluations of the software architecture that begins at the early stages of the development and is periodically and repeatedly performed throughout the lifetime of the software system. Numerous approaches have been developed for continuous evaluation; to handle dynamics and uncertainties at run-time, over the past years, these approaches are still very few, limited, and lack maturity. Objective: This review surveys efforts on architecture evaluation and provides a unified terminology and perspective on the subject. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and analyse architecture evaluation approaches for uncertainty including continuous and non-continuous, covering work published between 1990–2020. We examined each approach and provided a classification framework for this field. We present an analysis of the results and provide insights regarding open challenges. Major results and conclusions: The survey reveals that most of the existing architecture evaluation approaches typically lack an explicit linkage between design-time and run-time. Additionally, there is a general lack of systematic approaches on how continuous architecture evaluation can be realised or conducted. To remedy this lack, we present a set of necessary requirements for continuous evaluation and describe some examples.},

abstract = {AI technologies continue to advance from digital assistants to assisted decision-making. However, designing AI remains a challenge given its unknown outcomes and uses. One way to expand AI design is by centering stakeholders in the design process. We conduct co-design sessions with gig workers to explore the design of gig worker-centered tools as informed by their driving patterns, decisions, and personal contexts. Using workers’ own data as well as city-level data, we create probes—interactive data visuals—that participants explore to surface the well-being and positionalities that shape their work strategies. We describe participant insights and corresponding AI design considerations surfaced from data probes about: 1) workers’ well-being trade-offs and positionality constraints, 2) factors that impact well-being beyond those in the data probes, and 3) instances of unfair algorithmic management. We discuss the implications for designing data probes and using them to elevate worker-centered AI design as well as for worker advocacy.},

abstract = {AI-based design tools are proliferating in professional software to assist engineering and industrial designers in complex manufacturing and design tasks. These tools take on more agentic roles than traditional computer-aided design tools and are often portrayed as “co-creators.” Yet, working effectively with such systems requires different skills than working with complex CAD tools alone. To date, we know little about how engineering designers learn to work with AI-based design tools. In this study, we observed trained designers as they learned to work with two AI-based tools on a realistic design task. We find that designers face many challenges in learning to effectively co-create with current systems, including challenges in understanding and adjusting AI outputs and in communicating their design goals. Based on our findings, we highlight several design opportunities to better support designer-AI co-creation.},

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

Standardization research on 3D (three-dimensional) model of power transmission and transformation project was carried out, which is conducive to promoting the sharing of massive engineering information and fully exploiting the value of engineering data. In order to achieve reduction of the model volume, advanced modeling methods need to be studied. Therefore, the 3D spatial modeling method was studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of different 3D modeling methods were compared and analyzed. The CSG modeling technology was used based on the actual situation. The power transmission and transformation engineering design model based on CSG modeling technology were build. Combined with the characteristics of substation model, a 3D modeling method for substation was given.},

Motivated by challenges that existing technology approaches encountered for improving intergenerational storytelling (e.g., the need to hold the tablet, the potential view detachment from the physical world in Virtual Reality (VR)), we sought to find new ways of using Augmented Reality (AR) to support intergenerational storytelling, which offers new capabilities (e.g., 3D models, new interactivity) to enhance the expression for the storyteller. We conducted a two-part exploratory study, where pairs of grandparents and grandchildren 1) participated in an in-person storytelling activity with a semi-structured interview 2) and then a participatory design session with AR technology probes that we designed to inspire their exploration. Our findings revealed insights into the possible ways of intergenerational storytelling, the feasibility and usages of AR in facilitating it, and the key design implications for leveraging AR in intergenerational storytelling.},

We investigated how VUIs could support inclusive education, particularly for pupils with visual impairments (VIs). We organised focused discussions with educators at a school, with support staff from local authorities and, through bodystorming, with a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools, and opened a space for educators, sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios, a design space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this space.},

We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.},

abstract = {High quality and affordable support for chronic health conditions is simultaneously one of the great challenges and opportunities for the application of ubiquitous computing technologies. Mobile networks of wearable connected devices and sensors have the potential to offer data driven personalized support and contextually aware real-time advice that could help people in their everyday lives. My initial research has suggested three key areas for the implementation of such systems: reducing workload, automating extraction of meaningful information, and the communication of insights in an intuitive, timely and emotionally sensitive manner. While there are many technical issues involved with realization, the human factors related to user interaction with personal data will be critical in building systems that motivate users to choose beneficial lifestyle choices, and will therefore be a major focus of my research.},

abstract = {We propose a method that allows to develop shared understanding between two agents for the purpose of performing a task that requires cooperation. Our method focuses on efficiently establishing successful task-oriented communication in an open multi-agent system, where the agents do not know anything about each other and can only communicate via grounded interaction. The method aims to assist researchers that work on human-machine interaction or scenarios that require a human-in-the-loop, by defining interaction restrictions and efficiency metrics. To that end, we point out the challenges and limitations of such a (diverse) setup, while also restrictions and requirements which aim to ensure that high task performance truthfully reflects the extent to which the agents correctly understand each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate a use-case where our method can be applied for the task of cooperative query answering. We design the experiments by modifying an established ontology alignment benchmark. In this example, the agents want to query each other, while representing different databases, defined in their own ontologies that contain different and incomplete knowledge. Grounded interaction here has the form of examples that consists of common instances, for which the agents are expected to have similar knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate successful communication establishment under the required restrictions, and compare different agent policies that aim to solve the task in an efficient manner.},

abstract = {This essay joins recent scholarship in arguing that FAccT's fundamental framing of the potential to achieve the normative conditions for justice through bettering the design of algorithmic systems is counterproductive to achieving said justice in practice. Insofar as the FAccT community's research tends to prioritize design-stage interventions, it ignores the fact that the majority of the contextual factors that practically determine FAccT outcomes happen in the implementation and impact stages of AI/ML lifecycles.We analyze an emergent and widely-cited movement within the FAccT community for attempting to honor the centrality of contextual factors in shaping social outcomes, a set of strategies we term ‘metadata maximalism’. Symptomatic of design-centered approaches, metadata maximalism abstracts away its reliance on institutions and structures of justice that are, by every observable metric, already struggling (where not failing) to provide accessible, enforceable rights. These justice infrastructures, moreover, are currently wildly under-equipped to manage the disputes arising from digital transformation and machine learning. The political economy of AI/ML implementation provides further obstructions to realizing rights. Data and software supply chains, in tandem with intellectual property protections, introduce structural sources of opacity. Where duties of care to vulnerable persons should reign, profit incentives are given legal and regulatory primacy. Errors are inevitable and inextricable from the development of machine learning systems.In the face of these realities, FAccT programs, including metadata maximalism, tend to project their efforts in a fundamentally counter-factual universe: one in which functioning institutions and processes for due diligence in implementation and for redress of harms are working and ready to interoperate with. Unfortunately, in our world, these institutions and processes have been captured by the interests they are meant to hold accountable, intentionally hollowed-out, and/or were never designed to function in today's sociotechnical landscape. Continuing to produce (fair! accountable! transparent!) data-enabled systems that operate in high-impact areas, irrespective of this landscape's radically insufficient paths to justice, given the unavoidability of errors and/or intentional misuse in implementation, and the exhaustively-demonstrated disproportionate distribution of resulting harms onto already-marginalized communities, is a choice - a choice to be CounterFAccTual.},

We instantiate our design with a use case in the cultural sector, specifically a Neolithic archaeological site that acts as a stage of conversation on such hard themes. Our larger contributions include an interaction framework for bots of conviction, insights gained from an iterative process of participatory design and evaluation, and a vision for bot interaction mechanisms that can apply to the HCI community more widely.},

abstract = {Distributed Virtual Environments (DVEs), such as online games, military simulations, collaborative design, etc., are very popular nowadays. To support large-scale DVEs, a multi-server architecture is usually employed, and the virtual world is partitioned into multiple zones for load distribution. The client assignment problem arises when assigning the participating clients to the servers. Current approaches usually assign clients to servers according to the locations of clients in the virtual world, i.e., clients interacting in the same zone of the virtual world will be assigned to the same server. This approach may degrade the interactivity of DVEs if the network delay from a client to its assigned server is large. In this paper, we formulate the client assignment problem, and propose two algorithms to assign clients to servers in a more efficient way. The proposed algorithms are based on the heuristics developed for the well-known Terminal Assignment problem. Simulation results with the BRITE Internet Topology Generator show that our algorithms are effective in enhancing the interactivity of DVEs.},

The seminar discussions were centered around five core topics: (1) agile end-toend handling of uncertainties in goal-oriented self-adaptive systems, (2) managing uncertainty risks for self-adaptive systems, (3) uncertainty propagation and interaction, (4) uncertainty in self-adaptive machine learning systems, and (5) human empowerment under uncertainty. Building on the insights from these discussions, we propose a research agenda listing key open challenges, and a possible way forward for addressing them in the coming years.},

Modeling human emotions is particularly complicated when we consider the lived experiences of people who are on the autism spectrum. To understand the emotional experiences of autistic adults and their attitudes towards common representations of emotions, we deployed a context study as the first phase of a Grounded Design research project. Based on community observations and interviews, this work contributes empirical evidence of how the emotional experiences of autistic adults are entangled with social interactions as well as the processing of sensory inputs. We learned that (1) the emotional experiences of autistic adults are embodied and co-constructed within the context of physical environments, social relationships, and technology use, and (2) conventional approaches to visually representing emotion in affective education and computing systems fail to accurately represent the experiences and perceptions of autistic adults. We contribute a social-emotional-sensory design map to guide designers in creating more diverse and nuanced affective computing interfaces that are enriched by accounting for neurodivergent users.},

abstract = {VR has received increased attention as an educational tool and many argue it is destined to influence educational practices, especially with the emergence of the Metaverse. Most prior research on educational VR reports on applications or systems designed for specified educational or training objectives. However, it is also crucial to understand current practices and attitudes across disciplines, having a holistic view to extend the body of knowledge in terms of VR adoption in an authentic setting. Taking a higher-level perception of people in different roles, we conducted a qualitative analysis based on 23 interviews with major stakeholders and a series of participatory design workshops with instructors and students. We identified the stakeholders who need to be considered for using VR in higher education, and highlighted the challenges and opportunities critical for VR current and potential practices in the university classroom. Finally, we discussed the design implications based on our findings. This study contributes a detailed description of current perceptions and considerations from a multi-stakeholder perspective, providing new empirical insights for designing novel VR and HCI technologies in higher education.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant source of suffering, disability and societal cost in the US. However, while the ability to detect a person's risk for developing persistent pain is desirable for timely assessment, management, treatment, and reduced health care costs---no objective measure to detect clinical pain intensity exist. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have deployed clinical decision- making and assessment tools to enhance pain risk detection across core social and clinical domains. Yet, risk assessment models are only as "good" as the data they are based on. Thus, ensuring fairness is also a critical component of equitable care in both the short and long term. This paper takes an intersectional and public health approach to AI fairness in the context of pain and invisible disability, suggesting that computational ethnography is a multimodal and participatory real-world data (RWD) methodology that can be used to enhance the curation of intersectional knowledge bases, thereby expanding existing boundaries of AI fairness in terms of inclusiveness and transparency for pain and invisible disability use cases.},

To address this, we introduce ConceptEVA, a mixed-initiative approach to generate, evaluate, and customize summaries for long and multi-topic documents. ConceptEVA incorporates a custom multi-task longformer encoder decoder to summarize longer documents. Interactive visualizations of document concepts as a network reflecting both semantic relatedness and co-occurrence help users focus on concepts of interest. The user can select these concepts and automatically update the summary to emphasize them. We present two iterations of ConceptEVA evaluated through an expert review and a within-subjects study. We find that participants’ satisfaction with customized summaries through ConceptEVA is higher than their own manually-generated summary, while incorporating critique into the summaries proved challenging. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing summarization systems incorporating mixed-initiative interactions.},

abstract = {Drawing curves in mid-air with fingers is a fundamental task with applications to 3D sketching, geometric modeling, handwriting recognition, and authentication. Mid-air curve input is most commonly accomplished through explicit user input; akin to click-and-drag, the user may use a hand posture (e.g. pinch) or a button-press on an instrumented controller to express the intention to start and stop sketching. In this paper, we present a novel approach to recognize the user's intention to draw or not to draw in a mid-air sketching task without the use of postures or controllers. For every new point recorded in the user's finger trajectory, the idea is to simply classify this point as either hover or stroke. Our work is motivated by a behavioral study that demonstrates the need for such an approach due to the lack of robustness and intuitiveness while using hand postures and instrumented devices. We captured sketch data from users using a haptics device and trained multiple binary classifiers using feature vectors based on the local geometric and motion profile of the trajectory. We present a systematic comparison of these classifiers and discuss the advantages of our approach to spatial curve input applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the potential of AI-assisted visualization during the problem identification and construction phase of the creative problem-solving process. We examine this within the context of the ongoing crea.visions research project, which employs AI technologies to visualize citizens' visions of the future. Our findings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as: 1) the tool's dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhancement of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limitations related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts. This study serves as a foundation for future research on AI-assisted image generation as a resource in creative problem-solving, laying the groundwork for the creation of increasingly effective and user-friendly tools.},

abstract = {Data-driven health technologies, such as wearables and medical devices, are increasingly part of children’s daily lives. These technologies help children collect, reflect on, and use their health data. The hope is that they develop healthy habits and skills and prepare themselves to manage their health and wellbeing. However, past research has shown that children, especially those of young age, have limited interactions with these technologies and often struggle to understand their health data. My dissertation research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how children and their caregivers (i.e., parents and healthcare providers) perceive data-driven health technologies, and use the resulting data to improve children’s health. Drawing on findings from a systematic literature review, content analysis, qualitative interviews, and participatory design workshops, my dissertation research fosters discussion of children’s health data literacy and identifies design opportunities to build children’s health capacity through supporting their health data literacy.},

abstract = {Despite a lack of consensus on the nature of Computing Research Methods (CRM), a growing number of programs are exploring models and content for CRM courses. This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

In this work, we aim to understand impacted stakeholders’ perspectives on a deployed ADS that prioritizes scarce housing resources. We employed AI lifecycle comicboarding, an adapted version of the comicboarding method, to elicit stakeholder feedback and design ideas across various components of an AI system’s design. We elicited feedback from county workers who operate the ADS daily, service providers whose work is directly impacted by the ADS, and unhoused individuals in the region. Our participants shared concerns and design suggestions around the AI system’s overall objective, specific model design choices, dataset selection, and use in deployment. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders, even without AI knowledge, can provide specific and critical feedback on an AI system’s design and deployment, if empowered to do so.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

The emerging capabilities of intelligent learning systems highlight and exacerbate existing challenges with meaningful human control of, and accountability for, the actions and effects of such systems. The related challenge of human ‘answerability’ for system actions and harms has come into focus in recent literature on responsibility gaps [2, 3]. We describe a proposed interdisciplinary approach to designing for answerability in autonomous systems, grounded in an instrumentalist framework of ‘responsible agency cultivation’ drawn from moral philosophy and cognitive sciences as well as empirical results from structured interviews and focus groups in the application domains of health, finance and government. We outline a prototype dialogue agent informed by these emerging results and designed to help bridge the structural gaps in organisations that typically impede the human agents responsible for an autonomous sociotechnical system from answering to vulnerable patients of responsibility.},

This requires practitioners to act with intent and align their decision-making with ethical implications while navigating professional, organisational and business objectives. How can we support UX practitioners to deal with ethical tensions in this complex and uncertain space that encompasses many inter-personal, social and temporal dimensions? To explore this issue, we follow an iterative participatory design approach with 13 UX practitioners. Our findings revealed ethical tensions are experienced at different levels of micro (self, other design teams), meso (management or organisation as a whole) and macro (society) pertaining to varied practitioners attitudes towards ethical tensions (investigating, suppressing and mediating). The communities that UX practitioners relate to were found to be vital sites of care and safety that enable members to surface and mediate ethical tensions. We propose new directions for resources to support practitioners in dealing with multi-faceted ethical tensions.},

Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity, especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology, an important, emerging concern is how the self-the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency-plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question, we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of "care of the self," which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design.},

Similar issues are encountered by a variety of organizations, e.g., mobile-phone manufacturers and online magazines, who have to create new (non-existent) items to satisfy groups of users with different preferences. In this paper, we present a joint problem formalization of these interrelated issues, and propose generative methods that address these questions simultaneously. Specifically, we leverage on the latent space obtained by training a deep generative model---the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)---via a loss function that incorporates both rating performance and item reconstruction terms. We use a greedy search algorithm that utilize this learned latent space to jointly obtain K plausible new items, and user groups that would find the items appealing. An evaluation of our methods on a synthetic dataset indicates that our approach is able to generate novel items similar to highly-desirable unobserved items. As case studies on real-world data, we applied our method on the MART abstract art and Movielens Tag Genome datasets, which resulted in promising results: small and diverse sets of novel items.},

Two compelling strategies technologists have used to counteract such trends include games and generative AI art. In this paper, we design and test Closer Worlds, an ML-assisted 2-person game that fosters emotionally intimate conversations through co-creative world-building. We explore design principles inspired by facilitation methods and assess their effectiveness in a pilot study. We find that Closer Worlds elicits some self-disclosure behavior, but less than a social game without generative AI. However, participants clearly enjoy the unique affordances offered by visualizing shared values, which suggests that this method offers a comfortable and novel avenue for meaningful conversations. We conclude by discussing future ways in which co-creative games might leverage generative techniques to foster pro-social environments.},

Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.}

Given recent work suggests that with progression of dementia, users are likely to minimize use of digital devices, accounting for non-digital practices around remembering presents an opportunity that can be leveraged when designing reminder technologies for people with dementia. This poster proposes a voice-based reminder system that connects both physical and digital reminders through embodied home objects and can be customized to the unique routines of the individual with dementia.

abstract = {Current robotic systems in surgery are telemanipulators, but the future will likely be more automated. Past and current developments literally put the robotic system at the center of the action, and force the surgical team to adapt to it. In addition to important advantages of robotic surgery, empirical studies identify serious disadvantages in sensory perception and team communication, leading to decreased situational awareness among the surgeon and the team. We therefore raise two interrelated questions: Which actors of a surgical team should be part of a controlled, semi-automated robotic assistance and how should the collaborative interaction between the actors (including the robot) be designed. Previous research has examined the situation awareness in robotic-assisted surgeries with bedside assistant, being either residents or specifically trained registered nurse first assistants, with advantages of one over the other. We built on this work by observing for the first time robotic-assisted surgeries with highly experienced bedside assistants, senior surgeons. We found that a senior surgeon in this role excelled once again, for example, through lively medical discussions and independent problem solving, and was more likely to give us clues about a thoughtful development of semi-autonomous, collaborative surgical robots. These new insights will form the basis for subsequent interviews in which surgical teams will reflect on their expectations of the robotic agency. Our overarching goal is then to translate the results into new user interface designs for robotic surgery through repeated cycles of participatory design workshops and expert evaluations.},

abstract = {For more than two decades software agent technology represents one of rapidly developing areas of research. The main achievement of this trend of research was the development of new programming models that address both the basic features of agenthood (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and social abilities) as well as more advanced, human-like features usually collectively coined in the agent literature as "mental attitudes" (beliefs, desires, intentions, commitments). Agent oriented technologies, engineering of agent systems, agent languages, development tools, and methodologies are an active and emergent research area. The recent challenge is to include agents in real software environments and widely use the agent paradigm in mainstream programming. In this paper we are going to give an overview of the rapidly developing area of software agents including: overview of the agent programming languages, tools and platforms; possible applications of intelligent and mobile software agents; agents in "Smart Environments".},

abstract = {In a human-AI co-creation, AI not only categorizes, evaluates and interprets data but also generates new content and interacts with humans. As co-creative AI is a form of intelligent technology that directly involves humans, it is critical to anticipate and address ethical issues during all design stages. The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore several ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using a design fiction (DF) methodology. DF is a speculative research method that depicts a new concept or technology through stories as an intangible prototype. We present the findings from the study as potential users’ perspectives, stances, and expectations around ethical challenges in human-AI co-creativity as a basis for designing human-centered ethical AI partners for human-AI co-creation.},

How might designers support such human values? We interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 OECD countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.},

abstract = {Employment outcomes for autistic1 individuals are often poorer relative to their neurotypical (NT) peers, resulting in a greater need for other forms of financial and social support. While a great deal of work has focused on developing interventions for autistic children, relatively less attention has been paid to directly addressing the employment challenges faced by autistic adults. One key impediment to autistic individuals securing employment is the job interview. Autistic individuals often experience anxiety in interview situations, particularly with open-ended questions and unexpected interruptions. They also exhibit atypical gaze patterns that may be perceived as, but not necessarily indicative of, disinterest or inattention. In response, we developed a closed-loop adaptive virtual reality (VR)–based job interview training platform, which we have named Career Interview Readiness in VR (CIRVR). CIRVR is designed to provide an engaging, adaptive, and individualized experience to practice and refine interviewing skills in a less anxiety-inducing virtual context. CIRVR contains a real-time physiology-based stress detection module, as well as a real-time gaze detection module, to permit individualized adaptation. We also present the first prototype of the CIRVR Dashboard, which provides visualizations of data to help autistic individuals as well as potential employers and job coaches make sense of the data gathered from interview sessions. We conducted a feasibility study with 9 autistic and 8 NT individuals to assess the preliminary usability and feasibility of CIRVR. Results showed differences in perceived usability of the system between autistic and NT participants, and higher levels of stress in autistic individuals during interviews. Participants across both groups reported satisfaction with CIRVR and the structure of the interview. These findings and feedback will support future work in improving CIRVR’s features in hopes for it to be a valuable tool to support autistic job candidates as well as their potential employers.},

But in the actual busy lives of users, ambient notifications might be forgotten or even missed, nullifying the original notification. Could a system use multiple levels of noticeability to ensure its message is received, and how could this concept be effectively portrayed? To examine these questions, we took a Research through Design approach and created plant-mimicking Shape-Changing Interface (S-CI) artifacts, then conducted interviews with 10 participants who currently used a reminder system for health-related activities. We report findings on acceptable scenarios to disrupting people for health-related activities, and participants’ reactions to our design choices, including how using naturalistic aesthetics led to interpretations of the uncanny and morose, and which ways system physicality affected imagined uses. We offer design suggestions in health-related notification systems and S-CIs, and discuss future work in ambient-to-disruptive technology.},

abstract = {A method of organizing the crowd to generate ideas is described. It integrates crowds using evolutionary algorithms. The method increases the creativity of ideas across generations, and it works better than greenfield idea generation. Specifically, a design space of internet-scale idea generation systems is defined, and one instance is tested: a crowd idea generation system that uses combination to improve previous designs. The key process of the system is the following: A crowd generates designs, then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs were compared to the initial designs and to the designs produced by a greenfield idea generation system. The results show that the sequential combination system produced more creative ideas in the last generation and outperformed the greenfield idea generation system. The design space of crowdsourced idea generation developed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied to a wide range of design problems. The work has both pragmatic and theoretical implications: New forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to test existing and emerging theories of coordination and participatory design. Moreover, it may be possible for human designers, organized as a crowd, to codesign with each other and with automated algorithms.},

Special care was brought to make the simulations playable by humans and to favor the apparition of coalitions. Being controlled by humans, the agents of the initial model became completely pro-active and were able to exchange coffee and money and to form coalitions to fulfill the buyer's offers. Coalitions appeared as expected.Besides, during these experiments, we observed the emergence of specialized roles which were not included in the initial model. We implemented a regular multi-agent system based on the initial model to test the distributed system solving improvements brought by the roles that emerged.},

We build on these prior efforts to explore what a recommendation algorithm transparency report may include and how it should present information to users. Through a human-centered co-design research process we result in: (1) A set of guidelines for recommendation algorithm transparency reports; (2) initial suggestions, in the form of prototypes, for more engaging and interactive forms of transparency; (3) an evaluation of these prototypes’ strengths and weaknesses, and areas of exploration for future work.},

abstract = {Investigations of facial analysis (FA) technologies-such as facial detection and facial recognition-have been central to discussions about Artificial Intelligence's (AI) impact on human beings. Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning (DL) approaches have resulted in the dynamic generation of trace links that are far more accurate than was previously possible. However, DL-generated links lack clear explanations, and therefore non-experts in the domain can find it difficult to understand the underlying semantics of the link, making it hard for them to evaluate the link's correctness or suitability for a specific software engineering task. In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic healthcare systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the correctness of the link.},

abstract = {A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs. This user centered approach has proved fruitful, but there exists relatively little work examining the intent and values of the roboticists themselves. Furthermore, we know little of how the values of roboticists influence their own designs. Such knowledge could help designers better reflect on whether their designs effectively convey particular ethics to their users. In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids). Roboticists also see robots as testbeds for learning about humans themselves. We advocate a VSD approach for humanoids that goes beyond engineering disciplines and forces values to the forefront of discussion.},

Yet, the system's representation of reality can be more influential to outcomes than the complexities of daily life. They become problematic when they undermine the inclusivity of public decision making, and when their use perpetuates social or economic inequality.To address these challenges, the public must be able to participate in discourse about the implications of algorithmic systems. I propose a series of participatory installations exploring the impacts of algorithmic systems, providing contexts for active exploration of these concerns. I will conduct phenomenographic interviews to better understand how visitors experience art installations about technical topics, providing insight for subsequent installations. I will consolidate the results into a set of best practices about engaging the public on these topics.},

abstract = {The main purpose of assistive technology is to support an individual's daily activities, in order to increase ability, autonomy, relatedness and quality of life. The aim for the work presented in this article is to develop automated methods to tailor the behavior of the assistive technology for the purpose to provide just-in-time, adaptive interventions targeting multiple domains. This requires methods for representing and updating the user model, including goals, preferences, abilities, activity and its situation. We focus the assessment and intervention tasks typically performed by therapists and provide knowledge-based technology for supporting the process. A formative evaluation study was conducted as a part of a participatory action research process, involving two rehabilitation experts, two young individuals and one senior individual as end-user participants, in addition to knowledge engineers. The main contribution of this work is a theory-based method for assessing the individual's goals, preferences, abilities and motives, which is used for building a holistic user model. The user model is continuously updated and functions as the base for tailoring the system's assistive behavior during intervention and follow-up.},

abstract = {Research to date aimed at the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems has largely focused on topics such as identifying failures of current systems and on technical interventions intended to reduce bias in computational processes. Researchers have given less attention to methods that account for the social and political contexts of specific, situated technical systems at their points of use. Co-developing algorithmic accountability interventions in communities supports outcomes that are more likely to address problems in their situated context and re-center power with those most disparately affected by the harms of algorithmic systems. In this paper we report on our experiences using participatory and co-design methods for algorithmic accountability in a project called the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit. The main insights we gleaned from our experiences were: (i) many meaningful interventions toward equitable algorithmic systems are non-technical; (ii) community organizations derive the most value from localized materials as opposed to what is "scalable" beyond a particular policy context; (iii) framing harms around algorithmic bias suggests that more accurate data is the solution, at the risk of missing deeper questions about whether some technologies should be used at all. More broadly, we found that community-based methods are important inroads to addressing algorithmic harms in their situated contexts.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system that allows end users to design full body interactions with 3D animated virtual character through a process we call Interactive Performance Capture. This process is embodied in the sense that users design directly by moving and interacting using an interactive machine learning method. Two people improvise an interaction based only on their movements, one plays the part of the virtual character the other plays a real person. Their movements are recorded and they label it with metadata that identifies certain actions and responses. This labeled data is then used to train a Gaussian Mixture Model that is able to recognize new actions and generate suitable responses from the virtual character. A small study showed that users do indeed design in a very embodied way using movement directly as a means of thinking through and designing interactions.},

abstract = {The expansion of charging infrastructure and the optimal utilization of existing infrastructure are key influencing factors for the future growth of electric mobility. The main objective of this paper is to present a novel methodology which identifies the necessary stakeholders, processes their contextual information and meets their optimality criteria using a constraint satisfaction strategy. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used for optimally distributing the electric vehicle charging resources in a smart-mobility ecosystem. The algorithm performs context-aware, constrained-optimization such that the on-demand requests of each stakeholder, e.g., vehicle owner as end-user, grid-operator, fleet-operator, charging-station service operator, is fulfilled. In the proposed methodology, the system learns from the surrounding environment until the optimal charging resource allocation strategy within the limitations of the system constraints is reached. We look at the concept of optimality from the perspective of multiple stakeholders who participate in the smart-mobility ecosystem. A simple use case is presented in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential to develop this concept further to enable more complex digital interactions between the actors of a smart-mobility eco-system.},

These technologies have the potential to improve safety, but only if drivers understand how they work and when they may fail. Displays that dynamically show automation reliability (and likelihood of failure) have been suggested to improve performance, especially when the driver needs to take back control of the car. There remain many open questions about how best to design such displays. The proposed work investigates metric type, level of information, and modality of presentation to determine how best to improve driver outcomes of situation awareness, trust, reliance and compliance, and overall driving performance.},

Yet movement is not only functional, it is also highly expressive. In our research, we explore how movement expertise as articulated in Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) can contribute to the design of computational models of movement's expressive qualities as defined in the framework of Laban Efforts. We include experts in LMA in our design process, in order to select a set of suitable multimodal sensors as well as to compute features that closely correlate to the definitions of Efforts in LMA. Evaluation of our model shows that multimodal data combining positional, dynamic and physiological information allows for a better characterization of Laban Efforts. We conclude with implications for design that illustrate how our methodology and our approach to multimodal capture and recognition of Effort qualities can be integrated to design interactive applications.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design: Statistics, Digital Signal Processing, and Machine Learning in Practice provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for novel interaction design methods involving gesture, speech, text, and touch embedded in novel and emerging interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle devices, virtual reality, robotic, the Internet of Things (IoT), brain–computer interaction, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) for interactive systems. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working in interaction design on emerging platforms. This introductory textbook presents theory chapters on statistical grounding, signal processing, and ML foundations for guiding the development of novel interactive systems. Additional chapters discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces (BCI), probabilistic text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, building adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces (UIs). The chapters on case studies also highlight an in-depth look at domain-specific language (DSL) and ML methods used, for example, in touch, gesture, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout is the ubiquitous support for humans as they go about their daily professional or personal activities.This introductory book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal–multisensor systems. After each chapter an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the wider ethical issues on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during interaction with novel platforms.Parisa Eslambolchilar, Andreas Komninos, and Mark D.

abstract = {Over the past few decades, ubiquitous sensors and systems have been an integral part of humans’ everyday life. They augment human capabilities and provide personalized experiences across diverse contexts such as healthcare, education, and transportation. However, the widespread adoption of ubiquitous computing has also brought forth concerns regarding fairness and equitable treatment. As these systems can make automated decisions that impact individuals, it is essential to ensure that they do not perpetuate biases or discriminate against specific groups. While fairness in ubiquitous computing has been an acknowledged concern since the 1990s, it remains understudied within the field. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that incorporates fairness considerations into system design, including prioritizing stakeholder perspectives, inclusive data collection, fairness-aware algorithms, appropriate evaluation criteria, enhancing human engagement while addressing privacy concerns, and interactive improvement and regular monitoring. Our framework aims to guide the development of fair and unbiased ubiquitous computing systems, ensuring equal treatment and positive societal impact.},

Through individual interviews and collaborative design workshops, we explored ways to improve 360° video accessibility with immersion and engagement in mind. Our design workshops presented a unique opportunity for participants with diverse backgrounds to build on each others’ personal and professional experiences and collaboratively develop accessible 360° video prototypes. Participants included both AD creators and users, with a focus on BLV AD creators as their perspectives are underrepresented in prior work. We found that immersive video accessibility went beyond an extension of traditional video accessibility techniques. Participants valued accurate vocabulary and different points of view for descriptions, preferred a variety of presentation locations for spatialized AD, appreciated sound effects for setting the mood and subtly guiding, and wished to engage multiple senses to boost engagement. We conclude with implications for immersive media accessibility and future research directions to support disabled people as creators of access technology.},

However, interactive systems within industrial settings have yet to catch up with consumer products, especially with regard to the quality of interaction and user experience. With the rise of automation and data exchange on massive scales, the role of human work is challenged and the importance of cooperation emphasized. New concepts of smart factories in which machines and software are doing parts of the work tasks emerge, drastically altering the nature of work in industrial settings from manual labor to increasingly complex tasks. HCI and especially CSCW offer concepts, technical tools and methods to cope with this disruptive shift towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Networked assistive systems, for instance, are capable of individually addressing and satisfying the diverse needs of a heterogeneous workforce. We propose this workshop to discuss new perspectives on HCI and CSCW in industrial contexts with regard to the emerging IIoT. The goal of the workshop is to explore the design space of IIoT applications, its implications on cooperative work and to formulate new research opportunities to current challenges.},

abstract = {In recent years, a proliferation of women’s safety mobile applications have emerged in India that crowdsource street safety perceptions to generate ‘safety maps’ used by policy makers for urban design and academics for studying mobility patterns. Men and women’s differential access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), however, and the distinctions between their social and cultural subjective experiences may mitigate the value of crowdsourced safety perceptions data and the predictive ability of machine learning (ML) models utilizing such data. We explore this by collecting and analyzing primary data on safety perceptions from New Delhi, India. Our curated dataset consists of streetviews covering a wide range of neighborhoods for which we obtain subjective safety ratings from both female and male respondents. Simulation experiments where varying the proportion of ratings from each gender are assumed missing demonstrate that the predictive ability of standard ML techniques relies crucially on the distribution of data producers. We find that obtaining large amounts of crowdsourced safety labels from male respondents for predicting female safety perceptions is inefficient in a number of scenarios and even undesirable in others. Detailed comparisons between female and male respondents’ data demonstrate significant gender differences in safety perceptions and associated vocabularies. Our results have important implications for the design of platforms relying on crowdsourced data and the insights generated from them.},

abstract = {Recent developments in robotics demonstrated that bioinspiration and embodiement are powerful tools to achieve robust behavior in presence of little control. In this context morphological design is usually performed by humans, following a set of heuristic principles: in general this can be limiting, both from an engineering and an artificial life perspectives. In this work we thus suggest a different approach, leveraging evolutionary techniques. The case study is the one of improving the locomotion capabilities of an existing bioinspired robot. First, we explore the behavior space of the robot to discover a number of qualitatively different morphology-enabled behaviors, from whose analysis design indications are gained. The suitability of novelty search -- a recent open-ended evolutionary algorithm -- for this intended purpose is demonstrated. Second, we show how it is possible to condense such behaviors into a reconfigurable robot capable of online morphological adaptation (morphosis, morphing). Examples of successful morphing are demonstrated, in which changing just one morphological parameter entails a dramatic change in the behavior: this is promising for a future robot design. The approach here adopted represents a novel computed-aided, bioinspired, design paradigm, merging human and artificial creativity. This may result in interesting implications also for artificial life, having the potential to contribute in exploring underwater locomotion "as-it-could-be".},

abstract = {Responsive Design. Mobile First. Agile Development. Lean UX. Crowdsourcing. Machine Learning. In a world that has been disrupted by new technologies and approaches, what does it mean to do "front-end" or "user-centered design"? Are we relying on methods that are too rooted in the past? What techniques are succeeding and what changes do we need to be making? Do we need different data collected, different styles of prototyping, different design principles, and ways of structuring products or apps when building across multiple platforms? How will any changes in UCD techniques be received by current professionals as well as product managers and developers? This panel explores whether user research and design methods as we know them need to be radically overhauled, or some even eliminated.},

abstract = {Agent-based participatory simulations are laboratory experiments designed like agent-based simulations and where humans access the simulation as software agents.This paper describes the outcomes of six experiments lasting up to two hours each, where human players took part in an iterated game derived from the El Farol bar problem. Agents decide synchronously to go to the bar or to stay home and the benefit depends on the bar attendance, with a threshold effect: it is better to stay home if more than 60% of the agents go. Contrasting with the original version of this problem, we allowed agents, and therefore humans, to communicate before they took their decision.The first two experiments allowed us to train participants and to introduce the notion of teams. Teams represented coalitions within the game and positively affected scoring, but they were not part of an obvious solution to the problem and they did not enforce cooperative behavior in the game.Drawing from these experiments, we designed autonomous agents reproducing strategies of the participants. These agents took part in the last four participatory experiments and we observed the formation of coalitions between agents, between humans and between agents and humans.},

The results show how much all parties truly understand the requirements of the project. A trustworthy requirements prioritization process can ensure that the most important requirements are in line with business needs and should be developed first. The process results in the prioritized list of requirements that support decision making in release planning and subsequent activities to maximize software quality and customer satisfaction. This paper identified strengths and weaknesses of existing RP techniques. That leads to identification of factors in selecting the appropriate RP techniques for software projects. The recommendation can lead to improvement of the existing RP techniques. In addition, this paper presents the survey results of RP techniques used in participating software companies which developed software in Agile Software Development (ASD) context. The results reveal the challenges faced in their RP processes.},

In computing education, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these models to improve learning and teaching experiences in university-level programming courses. However, research into leveraging them to aid computer science instructors in curriculum development and course material design is relatively sparse, especially at the K-12 level. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas. We also hope to provide valuable insight into teachers’ perspectives on large language models and their integration into teaching practices.},

abstract = {With the development of quantum computing, the existing cryptography schemes based on classical cryptographic primitives will no longer be secure. Hence, cryptographers are designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes, and ideal lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. Today, as ideal lattice-based cryptography becomes more mature, its performance becomes an important optimization goal. In ideal lattice-based cryptography, polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling are the most time-consuming operations and therefore need to be accelerated. In this article, taking advantage of the parallelism of new 512-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX512), we present parallel implementations of polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling, thus comprehensively improving their performance. We conduct experiments with the Dilithium scheme(one scheme of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-4). Our implementation gets a nice performance boost compared to its pure C language and 256-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX2) implementation.},

abstract = {As spaces for learning about Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) research and practice (e.g., university classes, academic and industry labs, conferences) become more diverse, there is a pressing need to revise the universal collaborative and pedagogical structures supporting them. Specifically, it has become urgent to explore how to 'de-center' dominant assumptions about who learns in these environments. The goal of this workshop is to explore collectively how to craft learning spaces that resist universality by recognizing and valuing other perspectives and realities. We build on the scholarship of decolonial thinkers, which provides useful theoretical scaffolding on how to start working towards inclusivity and 'pluriversality'. That is, learning spaces where all views can co-exist as equally valid, albeit contradicting. Our workshop will be led by researchers and designers who have both guided and participated in academic and industry-based CSCW learning spaces across domains like Social Computing, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD), Critical Data Studies, and Participatory Design (PD). We invite a broad range of participants from research and practice interested in learning about or deepening their understanding of how to make of CSCW a more 'pluriversal' site for learning and practicing.},

abstract = {With the pervasive need for digitization in modern information society, publicly funded research projects increasingly focus on engineering digital approaches to manage societal processes. Such projects inherently face the challenge of establishing a sustainable software engineering culture. A major challenge thereby is that project consortia need to establish a distributed developer community that effectively and resource-efficiently aligns development efforts with the goals and needs of complex societal constellations beyond project lifetime. In this paper we extract empirical evidence from longitudinal studies in two large-scale research projects to outline typical challenges in such problem contexts and to develop an open source software engineering methodology for research projects, including supportive infrastructure and social instruments of community building and awareness. We thus contribute a comprehensive strategy preparing collaborative research projects for sustainable societal software engineering.},

abstract = {Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across different fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identified a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the effects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the effects. Our findings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identification, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.},

Civic robots - social robots that are designed to support people in civic participation - have potential to lower the barriers of participation especially for youth who face obstacles in participating through formal channels. We conducted an exploratory study with adolescents to investigate their perceptions of possible roles for civic robots. In the study, we asked participants of a youth event (n=24, age range 14-21) to ideate civic participation related purposes and concepts for social robots. The findings suggest that scenarios in which a robot serves as social facilitator or provides decision support for civic activities seem promising. In addition, civic robots could indirectly increase participation ability by providing emotional or social support.},

abstract = {Guided by a human-centered design focus on users' needs, Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) research and practice have increasingly explored how to address the multiple inequities affecting historically marginalized groups. A growing body of CSCW and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, building upon education and community development literature, argues that centering on needs dismisses marginalized users' capacity for driving change. Needs-based views often lead to designs for the "here and now,'' further marginalizing populations and perpetuating stereotypes. In contrast, an assets-based approach that puts users' knowledge, strengths, and capacities---textitassets ---at the core of design can better promote sustained impact. Translating assets into meaningful designs that interact with intersecting systems of oppression, however, raises critical questions:What are assets? Whose assets are privileged? What ethical considerations surface when facilitating assets-based reflections? How can an assets-based design tackle systems-level problems? In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and industry actors to explore the implications of assets-based perspectives across domains, including Education, Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD), and Participatory Design (PD). Specifically, we will work to develop guidelines and methodologies for CSCW researchers and designers to identify when and how to pursue an assets-based approach, navigating issues of power to translate assets into design effectively.},

Using a mixed method approach, this ongoing research paper explores how each of the 32 local authorities that make up Scotland utilise the Consul platform to engage their citizens in the PB process and how they then make sense of citizens' contributions.

We evaluate the interplay between measures of model performance, fairness, and the expected utility of decision-making to offer practical recommendations for the operationalization of algorithmic fairness principles for the development and evaluation of predictive models in healthcare. We conduct an empirical case-study via development of models to estimate the ten-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to inform statin initiation in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. We demonstrate that approaches that incorporate fairness considerations into the model training objective typically do not improve model performance or confer greater net benefit for any of the studied patient populations compared to the use of standard learning paradigms followed by threshold selection concordant with patient preferences, evidence of intervention effectiveness, and model calibration. These results hold when the measured outcomes are not subject to differential measurement error across patient populations and threshold selection is unconstrained, regardless of whether differences in model performance metrics, such as in true and false positive error rates, are present. In closing, we argue for focusing model development efforts on developing calibrated models that predict outcomes well for all patient populations while emphasizing that such efforts are complementary to transparent reporting, participatory design, and reasoning about the impact of model-informed interventions in context.},

abstract = {Online personalized advertising is often very effective in identifying relevant audiences for each piece of content, which has led to its widespread adoption. In today’s internet, however, these advertising systems are used not only to market products, but also consequential life opportunities such as employment or housing, as well as socially important political messaging. This has led to increasing concerns about the presence of algorithmic bias and possible discrimination in these important domains — with results showing problematic biases along gender, race, and political affiliation, even when the advertiser might have targeted broadly. A growing body of work focuses on measuring and characterizing these biases, as well as finding ways to mitigate these effects and building responsible systems. However, these results often emerge from different scientific communities and are often disconnected in the literature. In this paper, I attempt at bridging the gap between isolated efforts to either measure these biases, or to mitigate them. I discuss how the need to measure bias in advertising, and the efforts to mitigate it, despite being distant in the literature, are complementary problems that need to center their methodolgy around user studies. This paper presents a research agenda that focuses on the need for user-centric measurements of bias, by collecting real ads from users, and using surveys to understand user perceptions for these ads. My approach also calls for incorporating user sentiments into the mitigation efforts, by constraining optimization on user values that emerge from surveys. Finally, I also emphasize the need for involving users in the evaluation of responsible advertising systems; efforts to mitigate bias eventually need to be contextualized in terms of benefits to users instead of simple performance tradeoffs. My focus on the users is motivated by the fact that they are stakeholders in personalized advertising, vulnerable at the hand of algorithmic bias and harm, and therefore crucial in both efforts to measure and mitigate these effects.},

abstract = {Learning the dependency relations among entities and the hierarchy formed by these relations by mapping entities into some order embedding space can effectively enable several important applications, including knowledge base completion and prerequisite relations prediction. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to learn a good order embedding due to the existence of partial ordering and missing relations in the observed data. Moreover, most application scenarios do not provide non-trivial negative dependency relation instances. We therefore propose a framework that performs dependency relation prediction by exploring both rich semantic and hierarchical structure information in the data. In particular, we propose several negative sampling strategies based on graph-specific centrality properties, which supplement the positive dependency relations with appropriate negative samples to effectively learn order embeddings. This research not only addresses the needs of automatically recovering missing dependency relations, but also unravels dependencies among entities using several real-world datasets, such as course dependency hierarchy involving course prerequisite relations, job hierarchy in organizations, and paper citation hierarchy. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the prediction accuracy as well as to gain insights using the learned order embedding.},

abstract = {Autonomous Passenger Shuttles (APS) are rapidly becoming an urban public transit alternative. Traversing populous commercial and residential centers, these shuttles are already operating in several cities. In the absence of a human driver and embedded means of communicating the autonomous shuttle's intent, the task of seamlessly navigating crosswalks and pedestrian-friendly zones becomes a challenging pursuit for pedestrians.We contribute to the emerging notion of AV-Pedestrian Interaction by examining the context of autonomous passenger shuttles (APS) in real-world settings, and by comparing four different classes of visual signals -- namely instructional, symbolic, metaphorical, and anthropomorphic -- designed to communicate the shuttle's intentions. Following a participatory methodology involving local residents and public transport service provider, and working within the framework of inflexible road traffic regulations concerning the operation and testing of autonomous vehicles, we conducted a participatory design workshop, a qualitative, and a survey study. The findings revealed differences across these four classes of signals in terms of pedestrians' subjective perceptions. Anthropomorphic signals were identified as the preferred and effective modality in terms of pedestrians' interpretation of the communicated intent and their perceived sense of attention, confidence, and calmness. Additionally, pedestrians' experiences while judging the intention of transitionary vehicular states (starting/slowing) were reported as perplexing and evoked stress. These findings were translated into design and policy implications in collaboration with other stakeholders, and exemplify a viable way for assimilating human factors research in urban mobility.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore what role humans might play in designing tools for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact with the world. Recent work has explored RL methods that optimize a robot’s morphology while learning to control it, effectively dividing an RL agent’s environment into the external world and the agent’s interface with the world. Taking a user-centered design (UCD) approach, we explore the potential of a human, instead of an algorithm, redesigning the agent’s tool. Using UCD to design for a machine learning agent brings up several research questions, including what it means to understand an RL agent’s experience, beliefs, tendencies, and goals. After discussing these questions, we then present a system we developed to study humans designing a 2D racecar for an RL autonomous driver. We conclude with findings and insights from exploratory pilots with twelve users using this system.},

The paper shows that people are capable of providing creative input on their environment using unstructured speech or text and that a good proportion of these comments are actionable. The paper also investigates the use of public displays to auto-summarize comments left by the public so far.

Hybrid work paradigms have simultaneously created new opportunities for PSAI, but have also fostered anxieties of misuse and privacy intrusions within a power asymmetry. At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},

We believe that successfully applying technology to this problem will require careful studies of how the target population actually lives and what their actual needs are. We propose a combination of traditional laboratory studies and surveys, as well as the use of instrumented spaces and personal monitoring devices to measure how people behave, normally and while using proposed assistive devices. A key requirement is the development of ways to simultaneously monitor signals from the body, activities, and social interactions to provide a more complete view of individuals and their lives. Some of the core research issues are machine learning to design devices learn from and adapt to user behavior, user-computer interaction to build devices and systems that support users in their tasks, mobile computing to support user and device mobility, mobility and data management to represent, access, update, and protect information, sensing devices that monitor human activity and finally rapid prototyping of services in a sensor-rich environment, in a scalable and secure manner.},

The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations ”in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; ii) multimodal data and interfaces; iii) the design process; iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and v) sustainability of the deployment.},

abstract = {The intersection of theatre-performance, design, and informatics is a fertile area for a broader understanding of the possible design and interaction between people and avatars in simulated three dimensional information spaces. This paper outlines the theoretical modelling for the visualization of a generic avatar template applicable to information spaces. Such a representation, it is theorised, would indicate semantic and structural meanings between contents of a document collection of an information space to a person. The depiction would be mapped to the visualization engine and represented in a three-dimensional information space. Avatars require some artificial intelligence, (AI), which indicates knowledge about the structure and contents of the underlying information, if they are to aide the user in tasks related to the information system. This paper proposes that such knowledge will be represented in the geometry and structure of the avatar visualised at the interface. In this manner, the design and form of the avatar functions as a content analysis tool representing interaction between users and an information space. The grouping of such representations would lend the added benefit of a history of notational avatars tracing the user's path in an information space over set duration. Using object orientated programming, variables are attached to the body, in this case, the avatar. Depending upon the user's interaction with the hypermedia system different patterns will occur.It is theorised that such an approach to the modelling of avatars would enhance the communication of knowledge and meaning in large data sets where recurring problems of navigation are compounded by the representation of scalability to users.},

abstract = {Developers want to detect bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible, as the effort and cost to fix them increases with the incremental development of features. Ultimately, bugs that are only found in production can have catastrophic consequences.Type systems are effective at detecting many classes of bugs during development, often providing immediate feedback both at compile-time and while typing due to editor integration. Unfortunately, more powerful static and dynamic analysis tools do not have the same success due to providing false positives, not being immediate, or not being integrated into the language.Liquid Types extend the language type system with predicates, augmenting the classes of bugs that the compiler or IDE can catch compared to the simpler type systems available in mainstream programming languages. However, previous implementations of Liquid Types have not used human-centered methods for designing or evaluating their extensions. Therefore, this paper investigates how Liquid Types can be integrated into a mainstream programming language, Java, by proposing a new design that aims to lower the barriers to entry and adapts to problems that Java developers commonly encounter at runtime. Following a participatory design methodology, we conducted a developer survey to design the syntax of LiquidJava, our prototype.To evaluate if the added effort to writing Liquid Types in Java would convince users to adopt them, we conducted a user study with 30 Java developers. The results show that LiquidJava helped users detect and fix more bugs and that Liquid Types are easy to interpret and learn with few resources. At the end of the study, all users reported interest in adopting LiquidJava for their projects.},

abstract = {Research in robotics and human-robot interaction is becoming more and more mature. Additionally, more affordable social robots are being released commercially. Thus, industry is currently demanding ideas for viable commercial applications to situate social robots in public spaces and enhance customers experience. However, present literature in human-robot interaction does not provide a clear set of guidelines and a methodology to (i) identify commercial applications for robotic platforms able to position the users» needs at the centre of the discussion and (ii) ensure the creation of a positive user experience. With this paper we propose to fill this gap by providing a methodology for the design of robotic applications including these desired features, suitable for integration by researchers, industry, business and government organisations. As we will show in this paper, we successfully employed this methodology for an exploratory field study involving the trial implementation of a commercially available, social humanoid robot at an airport.},

abstract = {The field of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) has evolved immensely with respect to design and development of agents over the years. This has brought the following questions: What processes and methods are used to design virtual agents, and in particular, to what extent and how are users involved in the design process of virtual agents? In this paper, we review papers from the conference “Intelligent Virtual Agents” for the last five years (2015 - 2019) to shed light on these questions. The review included 308 short and long papers, with a focus on the interactive aspects of design. The review showed that only 14% of 308 papers explicitly mentioned/referred to user participation during the design of an IVA. User involvement is classified into two categories: one-time and iterative. The few studies that mention design only report on the use of standard Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design methods to a rather limited degree.},

abstract = {Human--building interaction (HBI) is converging the fields of architecture and interaction design, leading to new and interesting tensions in perspectives and methodological approaches. One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term.},

abstract = {Developing resilient autonomous systems requires an interdisciplinary approach that can understand performance variability and respond to critical events when they occur. Resilience within autonomous systems must also account for social norms as well as broader ethical and legal considerations. Within this paper we outline the importance of embedding Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic and Cultural (SLEEC) constraints within the development of future autonomous systems. A novel methodological approach is presented that combines Human Factors methods with Computer Science techniques to generate the environmental and situational requirements in combination with a computer rule-based requirements language. This approach also provides a possible structure for capturing contextual and situational information from key stakeholders in the development of autonomous systems. This structure will enable engagement with the stakeholders with respect to key elements identified from this interdisciplinary approach in a responsible way to ensure that future autonomous systems are user centred. The approach is domain independent, but it is applied here to the case of an autonomous assistive dressing robot that aids a user in a dressing task, with a specific critical event that requires a SLEEC resilient response},

abstract = {Diversity-aware platform design is a paradigm that responds to the ethical challenges of existing social media platforms. Available platforms have been criticized for minimizing users' autonomy, marginalizing minorities, and exploiting users' data for profit maximization. This paper presents a design solution that centers the well-being of users. It presents the theory and practice of designing a diversity-aware platform for social relations. In this approach, the diversity of users is leveraged in a way that allows like-minded individuals to pursue similar interests or diverse individuals to complement each other in a complex activity. The end users of the envisioned platform are students, who participate in the design process. Diversity-aware platform design involves numerous steps, of which two are highlighted in this paper: 1) defining a framework and operationalizing the "diversity" of students, 2) collecting "diversity" data to build diversity-aware algorithms. The paper further reflects on the ethical challenges encountered during the design of a diversity-aware platform.},

The panel further observed that there are dimensions of diversity to consider beyond age, color, gender, and physical ability. As technologists, we need to leverage diverse talents and perspectives, including by those who may not have in-depth domain knowledge or a university education specific to computer science or engineering. Panelists included academic researchers and industry practitioners: experts in human-computer interaction, teamwork, AI applications, systems design, and gender diversity issues. The hybrid organization of the panel enabled participants from Taiwan and North America to join the in-room Australian and New Zealand panelists. Panelists explored a variety of related topics, ranging from how software can cause harm to the risks of "unconscious bias" in R&amp;D and the challenges of building diverse teams. Panelists shared observations that AI and ML systems can be negatively impacted by the bias inherent with inadequate or incomplete training data used to tune algorithms. The panel discussed and summarized questions to foster increased DEI awareness by software professionals, researchers, and community leaders.},

abstract = {Autistic children’s emotional meltdown is a common challenge faced by their caregivers, including their teachers and families. Communicating their problems can be extremely challenging for many autistic children, making it difficult for caregivers to identify the triggers of these meltdowns. Previous studies have revealed that autistic children find it easier to communicate with non-human objects, such as comfort dolls or social robots. In light of this, we have designed Kodi, a mobile virtual conversational agent aimed at bridging the communication gap between autistic children and their caregivers during distressing situations. Kodi’s appearance can be personalized to match the child’s favorite characters, such as a bunny or a dinosaur. To provide additional comfort, Kodi comes with furry phone cases that offer haptic stimulation. When the child faces stressful situations, caregivers can prompt Kodi on children’s mobile device, allowing the child to express their emotions with various input modalities (emojis, text, voice) and listen to soothing stories. Caregivers can tailor these stories to suit each child’s unique needs. Furthermore, Kodi will employ keyword analysis to summarize conversations, identify potential triggers for emotional meltdowns (e.g., loud noises in a shopping mall, unexpected changes at school), and alert caregivers of potential problems, such as bullying. The data collected through Kodi holds the potential to be leveraged for predicting emotional meltdowns using machine learning techniques. This paper discusses the implications of the Kodi platform and outlines future research directions in this area.},

As public sector agencies begin to adopt ADS, it is critical that we understand workers’ experiences with these systems in practice. In this paper, we present findings from a series of interviews and contextual inquiries at a child welfare agency, to understand how they currently make AI-assisted child maltreatment screening decisions. Overall, we observe how workers’ reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their knowledge of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures, (2) their beliefs about the ADS’s capabilities and limitations relative to their own, (3) organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the ADS, and (4) awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own decision-making objectives. Drawing upon these findings, we discuss design implications towards supporting more effective human-AI decision-making.},

The FairCeptron framework is an approach for studying perceptions of fairness in algorithmic decision making such as in ranking or classification. It supports (i) studying human perceptions of fairness and (ii) comparing these human perceptions with measures of algorithmic fairness. The framework includes fairness scenario generation, fairness perception elicitation and fairness perception analysis. We demonstrate the FairCeptron framework by applying it to a hypothetical university admission context where we collect human perceptions of fairness in the presence of minorities. An implementation of the FairCeptron framework is openly available, and it can easily be adapted to study perceptions of algorithmic fairness in other application contexts. We hope our work paves the way towards elevating the role of studies of human fairness perceptions in the process of designing algorithmic decision making systems.},

Collaboration support tools aim to reduce the adverse effects of this restricted access to the fluid intermixing of speech, gesturing, writing and sketching by providing mechanisms to enhance the awareness of distributed participants of each others' actions.In this work we explore novel ways to leverage the capabilities of multimodal context-aware systems to bridge co-located and distributed collaboration contexts. We describe a system that allows participants at remote sites to collaborate in building a project schedule via sketching on multiple distributed whiteboards, and show how participants can be made aware of naturally occurring pointing gestures that reference diagram constituents as they are performed by remote participants.The system explores the multimodal fusion of pen, speech and 3D gestures, coupled to the dynamic construction of a semantic representation of the interaction, anchored on the sketched diagram, to provide feedback that overcomes some of the intrinsic ambiguities of pointing gestures.},

abstract = {We propose HeadGesture, a hands-free input approach to interact with Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices. Using HeadGesture, users do not need to raise their arms to perform gestures or operate remote controllers in the air. Instead, they perform simple gestures with head movement to interact with the devices. In this way, users' hands are free to perform other tasks, e.g., taking notes or manipulating tools. This approach also reduces the hand occlusion of the field of view [11] and alleviates arm fatigue [7]. However, one main challenge for HeadGesture is to distinguish the defined gestures from unintentional movements. To generate intuitive gestures and address the issue of gesture recognition, we proceed through a process of Exploration - Design - Implementation - Evaluation. We first design the gesture set through experiments on gesture space exploration and gesture elicitation with users. Then, we implement algorithms to recognize the gestures, including gesture segmentation, data reformation and unification, feature extraction, and machine learning based classification. Finally, we evaluate user performance of HeadGesture in the target selection experiment and application tests. The results demonstrate that the performance of HeadGesture is comparable to mid-air hand gestures, measured by completion time. Additionally, users feel significantly less fatigue than when using hand gestures and can learn and remember the gestures easily. Based on these findings, we expect HeadGesture to be an efficient supplementary input approach for HMD devices.},

abstract = {This course will introduce participants to the three main stages of the development life cycle of gesture-based interactions: (ul) how to design a gesture user interface (UI) by carefully considering key aspects, such as gesture recognition techniques, variability in gesture articulation, properties of invariance (sampling, direction, position, scale, rotation), and good practices for gesture set design, (ii) how to implement a gesture UI with existing recognizers, software architecture, and libraries, and (iii) how to evaluate a gesture user interface with the help of various metrics of user performance. The course will also cover a discussion about the wide range of gestures, such as touch, finger, wrist, hand, arm, and whole-body gestures. Participants will be engaged to try out various tools on their own laptops and will leave the course with a set of useful resources for prototyping and evaluating gesture-based interactions in their own projects.},

abstract = {Most commonly used approaches to developing automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems are Big Data-driven and machine learning-based. However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders' tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders' needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project "Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia" to illustrate our method. We intend this paper to contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning the use of algorithms in supporting critical decision-making in society.},

abstract = {While interacting with a social robot, children have a need to express themselves and have their expressions acknowledged by the robot. A need that is often unaddressed by the robot, due to its limitations in understanding the expressions of children. To keep the child-robot interaction manageable the robot takes control, undermining children's ability to co-regulate the interaction. Co-regulation is important for having a fulfilling social interaction. We developed a co-creation activity that aims to facilitate more co-regulation. Children are enabled to create sound effects, gestures, and light shows for the robot to use during their conversation. Results from a user study (N = 59 school children, 7-11 y.o.) showed that the co-creation activity successfully facilitated co-regulation by improving children's agency. Co-creation furthermore increases children's acceptance of the robot.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of the iconic Aware Home project [39] in 1999, the notion of “living laboratory” has been taken up and developed in HCI research. Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed—inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as “Visited Places,” “Instrumented Places,” “Instrumented People,” “Lived-in Places,” and “Innovation Spaces.” In the first part of this article, we describe in detail the method and outcome of our analysis that draws out the five strands. Building on the results of the first part, in the second part of this article, each of the five types of living lab is discussed using some of the prototypical examples of that kind presented in the literature. Finally, we discuss the raison d’\^{e}tre and future position of the living lab as a method within HCI research and design and in relation to advances in sensing technologies and the emerging world of intelligent built environments (e.g., smart city and smart home).},

abstract = {To form a training set for a source-code change prediction model, e.g., using the association rule mining or machine learning techniques, commits from the source code history are needed. The traceability between releases and commits would facilitate a systematic choice of history in units of the project evolution scale (i.e., commits that constitute a software release). For example, the major release 25.0 in Chrome is mapped to the earliest revision 157687 and latest revision 165096 in the trunk. Using this traceability, an empirical study is reported on the frequency distribution of file changes for different release windows. In Chrome, the majority (50%) of the committed files change only once between a pair of consecutive releases. This trend is reversed after expanding the window size to at least 10. That is, the majority (50%) of the files change multiple times when commits constituting 10 or greater releases are considered. These results suggest that a training set of at least 10 releases is needed to provide a prediction coverage for majority of the files.},

abstract = {Even though a broad range of social robots are currently available on the market, social robots are not yet an integral part of companies, healthcare providers, or public institutions. This might be due to the fact that the prevalent developer perspective immanently focuses on technological advancements, whereas a human-centered view remains underrepresented. In this paper, we argue that a human-centered perspective which integrates values and beliefs of relevant technology stakeholders needs to complement existing approaches to social robot design. Therefore, we propose to apply value sensitive design (VSD) to improve the process of social robot development and design. Even though VSD has become popular in recent years and it represents an established approach to foster innovative technologies, it has not yet been widely applied in the context of social robotics. Concretely, in this paper we will outline the added value of using VSD for social robots and we will explain how to utilize this methodology to enrich research and practice in social robotics.},

Inference in MSBNs can be performed effectively using their compiled representations. The compilation involves cooperative moralization and triangulation of the set of local graphical structures that collectively defines the dependencies among domain variables. Privacy of agents prevents us from compiling MSBNs by first assembling graphical subnets at a central location and then compiling their union. In earlier work, agents perform compilation in a limited parallel via a depth-first traversal of the local structures organized in a tree structure (called hypertree). Agents need some synchronization with each other. In this paper, we present an iterative method, by which multiple agents compile MSBNs asynchronously. Compared to the traversal method, the iterative one is self-adaptive and robust.},

In a creative collaboration, communication is an essential component among collaborators. In many existing co-creative systems, users can communicate with the AI, usually using buttons or sliders. Typically, the AI in co-creative systems cannot communicate back to humans, limiting their potential to be perceived as partners rather than just a tool. This paper presents a study with 38 participants to explore the impact of two interaction designs, with and without AI-to-human communication, on user engagement, collaborative experience and user perception of a co-creative AI. The study involves user interaction with two prototypes of a co-creative system that contributes sketches as design inspirations during a design task. The results show improved collaborative experience and user engagement with the system incorporating AI-to-human communication. Users perceive co-creative AI as more reliable, personal, and intelligent when the AI communicates to users. The findings can be used to design effective co-creative systems, and the insights can be transferred to other fields involving human-AI interaction and collaboration.},

Since NDDs have different needs, their way of communicating with a robot (e.g., speech-based) could differ among individuals. This paper aims to investigate the most suitable modality to communicate with a robot for NDDs - among voice, cards, and buttons - and explore their opinion on this matter. We ran an exploratory study involving 29 NDDs participants: 13 of them could freely communicate with an autonomous QT robot, 9 took part in a group discussion, and 7 first interacted individually with the robot, and then they participated in a group discussion. Our results showed that i) the cards were the most used communication modality, ii) voice can be used for counting games, buttons for multiple-choice games, and cards for memory-like games, iii) opinions did not differ much among groups.},

abstract = {Illiteracy is a global problem that impacts societal and economic growth and development, and is directly correlated with the financial success, health and overall well-being of individuals. Studies indicate that picture-book reading within a facilitated story-time setting is an important tool for language acquisition in children. The proposed research hypothesizes that in an increasingly digital society, literacy can be cultivated in a robot-embedded environment that is, at once, physical, digital and evocative of the picture-book being read. Inspired by concepts of embodied interaction, the research team proposes the design, implementation and evaluation of an intelligent, fine-tunable suite of architectural-robotic artifacts -- the LIT ROOM - distributed at room-scale in a public library setting. Through a reconfigurable, co-adaptive learning environment, the LIT ROOM aims to augment the dialogical reading of picture-books within an engaging and exploratory space for the advancement of literacy and learning.},

abstract = {Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is inherently a human-centric field of technology. The role of feminist theories in related fields (e.g. Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science) are taken as a starting point to present a vision for Feminist HRI which can support better, more ethical HRI practice everyday, as well as a more activist research and design stance. We first define feminist design for an HRI audience and use a set of feminist principles from neighboring fields to examine existent HRI literature, showing the progress that has been made already alongside some additional potential ways forward. Following this we identify a set of reflexive questions to be posed throughout the HRI design, research and development pipeline, encouraging a sensitivity to power and to individuals' goals and values. Importantly, we do not look to present a definitive, fixed notion of Feminist HRI, but rather demonstrate the ways in which bringing feminist principles to our field can lead to better, more ethical HRI, and to discuss how we, the HRI community, might do this in practice.},

abstract = {The Conversation Map system is a Usenet newsgroup browser that analyzes the text of an archive of newsgroup messages and outputs a graphical interface that can be used to search and read the messages of the archive. The system incorporates a series of novel text analysis procedures that automatically computes (1) a set of social networks detailing who is responding to and/or citing whom in the newsgroup; (2) a set of “discussion themes” that are frequently used in the newsgroup archive; and, (3) a set of semantic networks that represent the main terms under discussion and some of their relationships to one another. The text analysis procedures are written in the Perl programming language. Their results are recorded as HTML, and the HTML is displayed with a Java applet. With the Java-based graphical interface one can browse a set of Usenet newsgroup articles according to who is “talking” to whom, what they are “talking” about, and the central terms and possible emergent metaphors of the conversation. In this paper it is argued that the Conversation Map system is just one example of a new kind of content-based browser that will combine the analysis powers of computational linguistics with a graphical interface to allow network documents and messages to be viewed in ways not possible with today's, existing, format-based browsers which do not analyze the contents of the documents or messages.},

An anxious prospect to some, automation systems promise “progress” and profitability to others by conjuring corporate computational futures. What remains behind the scenes of these predictions and imaginaries of automation is the invisible human labor of global ghost workers caring for, maintaining, and repairing technologies. Invisible but irreplaceable, computation performed by humans in precarious conditions fills gaps that computer technologies lack skills and sensibility for. In this hybrid workshop, we ask who the “ghosts” are in the machines.

abstract = {Deployment of speech and language technology for social good (LT4SG), especially those targeted at the welfare of marginalized communities and speakers of low-resource and under-served languages, has been a prominent theme of research within NLP, Speech and the AI communities. Many researchers, especially those working in core NLP/Speech domains, rely on a combination of individual expertise, experiences or ad hoc surveys for prioritizing between language technologies that provide social good to the end-users. This has been criticized by several scholars who argue that it is critical to include the target community during the LT’s design and development process. However, prioritization of communities, languages, technologies and design approaches presents a very large set of complex challenges to the technologists, for which there are no simple or off-the-shelf solutions. In this position paper, we distill our experiential insights into six fundamental conundrums that technologists face and must resolve while deciding which LT technology to build for which community, and by using what approach. We discuss that at the root of these conundrums lie certain fundamental ethical problems of a digital-divide that can be overcome only by resolving deeper ethical dilemmas of distributive justice. We urge the community to reflect on these conundrums and leverage shared experiential insights to reconcile the intent of broadly, any Technology for Social Good, with the ground realities of its deployment.},

Online platforms seek to moderate such content to limit societal harm, to comply with legislation, and to create a more inclusive environment for their users. Researchers have developed different methods for automatically detecting harmful content, often focusing on specific sub-problems or on narrow communities, as what is considered harmful often depends on the platform and on the context. We argue that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of harmful content online platforms seek to curb, and what research efforts there are to automatically detect such content. We thus survey existing methods as well as content moderation policies by online platforms in this light and suggest directions for future work.},

However, even though visually impaired (VI) and sighted peers are side by side in the classroom, previous research showed a lack of participation of VI children in classroom dynamics and group activities. That leads to a reduced engagement between VI children and their sighted peers and a missed opportunity to value and explore class members' differences. Robots due to their physicality, and ability to perceive the world, socially-behave and act in a wide range of interactive modalities, can leverage mixed-visual ability children access to group activities while fostering their mutual understanding and social engagement. With this work, we aim to use social robots, as facilitators, to booster inclusive activities in mixed-visual abilities classroom.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving mental health, and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content generation for mindfulness practice in these methods, high-quality computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However, the user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation, which requires emotional expressiveness. In addition, work has not yet been done to study the effect of physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS voices for mindfulness. To that end, we designed a two-phase human subject study. In Phase 1, an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471) evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with 2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists' voices in 3 different physical embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot) with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices. Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices, suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.},

Therefore, we present a preliminary workshop with four children and young people with sight loss in order to begin investigating how this population learns about social robots for the first time, their overall impressions of social robots, and whether games could assist in creating positive first-time interactions. Our initial findings reveal the importance of promoting tactile exploration, clarifying safety aspects, and careful consideration of the communication of robot emotion.},

abstract = {Software requirements express the requirements and constraints on a software product that contributes to the satisfaction of some 'need' in the real world. Ambiguity is a major problem in requirements specification. At its most basic, a requirement is a property that a system must exhibit in order for it to meet the system's motivating need. We ignore intentional ambiguity or the ambiguity that exists in early stages of requirements elicitation and focus on ambiguity that remains in a so-called final natural language requirements document. Ambiguity is a problem because the different readers of the requirements specification may understand different things.An essential property of all requirements is that they should be verifiable. In a typical project there will be a large number of requirements derived from different sources and expressed at different levels of detail. The existing Requirement Engineering Techniques and Methodologies are supporting to a specific set of activity like Elicitation or validation. Requirement Engineering develops a mutual understanding between customers and project teams about the product or system requirements. An agreed-upon and approved product requirement becomes the initial baseline for product design. Knowledge of ambiguous, inconsistent requirements to requirement engineer increases the capability to view the requirements from different perspectives.This paper discusses the requirement generation process and allied activities in it. It also focuses on methodologies, models and techniques for requirement engineering. As a part of applying complete requirement engineering, we claim that the crucial issues like architecture and design in system development can be effectively addressed.},

abstract = {We compare two approaches for exploring large, hierarchical data spaces on mobile devices using facets. While the first approach arranges the facets in a 3x3 grid, the second approach makes use of a scrollable list of facets for exploring the data. As concrete scenario, we use category hierarchies that are dynamically obtained from different, distributed social media sources. We have conducted a between-group experiment of the two approaches with 64 subjects (41 male, 23 female) executing the same set of tasks of typical mobile users' information needs. The results show that subjects using the grid-based approach require significantly more time and more clicks for completing the tasks. However, regarding the subjects' satisfaction there is no significant difference between the two approaches. Thus, if efficiency is not the primary objective, the grid-based approach might be of interest as it provides a navigation element that allows the users to see the exact position in the data space. This might be a very useful feature in scenarios where knowing the exact position is quite crucial such as browsing classification schemas in digital libraries or other formal taxonomies.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces: user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, hand and body gestures, facial expressions, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces that often include biosignals.This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume of the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches for processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of information about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capability in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-time multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various modalities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapters discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on tools and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expanding field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep learning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.}

abstract = {Elections are the central institution of democratic processes, and often the elected body – in either public or private governance – is a committee of individuals. To ensure the legitimacy of elected bodies, the electoral processes should guarantee that diverse groups are represented, in particular members of groups that are marginalized due to gender, ethnicity, or other socially salient attributes. To address this challenge of representation, we have designed a novel participatory electoral process coined the Representation Pact, implemented with the support of a computational system. That process explicitly enables voters to flexibly decide on representation criteria in a first round, and then lets them vote for candidates in a second round. After the two rounds, a counting method is applied, which selects the committee of candidates that maximizes the number of votes received in the second round, conditioned on satisfying the criteria provided in the first round. With the help of a detailed use case that applied this process in a primary election of 96 representatives in Switzerland, we explain how this method contributes to fairness in political elections by achieving a better “descriptive representation”. Further, based on this use case, we identify lessons learnt that are applicable to participatory computational systems used in societal or political contexts. Good practices are identified and presented.},

abstract = {Modeling has a strong focus in current science learning frameworks as a critical skill for students to learn. However, understanding students' scientific models and their modeling practices at scale is a difficult task that has not been taken up by the research literature. The complex variables involved in classroom learning, such as teacher differences, increase the difficulty of understanding this problem. This work begins with an exploration of the methods used to explore students' scientific modeling in the learning sciences space and the frameworks developed to characterize student modeling practices. Learning analytics can be used to leverage these frameworks of scientific modeling practices to explore questions around students' scientific models and their modeling practices. These analyses are focused around the use of EcoSurvey, a collaborative, digital tool used in high-school biology classrooms to model the local ecosystem. This tool was deployed in ten biology classrooms and used with varying degrees of success. There are significant teacher-level differences found in the activity sequences of students using the EcoSurvey tool. The theoretical metrics around scientific modeling practices and automatically extracted feature sequences were also used in a classification task to automatically determine a particular student's teacher. These results underline the power of learning analytics methods to give insight into how modeling practices are realized in the classroom. This work also informs changes to modeling tools, associated curricula, and supporting professional development around scientific modeling.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has brought changes to every organization to be able to make changes quickly and adaptively. Organizations need to accelerate the use of digital technology which has an impact on changes in business processes. The use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology as software can support the automation of business processes in accordance with the rules of work performed by humans. RPA is a new technology that can be adopted by organizations to achieve various automation goals in the form of accuracy, efficiency, increase productivity and reduce operational costs. This research was conducted at one of the private bank in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the development of robotic process automation (RPA) in order to achieve various organizational automation goals. Data collection is carried out from primary data obtained by company employees who have used RPA and analyzed the condition of business process automation in various work units. In addition, interviews were conducted to identify the requirements for RPA development based on the needs and expectations of the automation objectives of the work unit. Secondary data were also obtained from a literature review on the implementation and benefits of RPA. The results show that the business process automation development company's has implemented 150 units of RPA robots in various work units ranging from operations, human capital, finance, compliance, and others. This research is expected to assist organizations in making decisions on the use of RPA and Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) support in order to achieve automation and digitization of business processes.},

In this session, I report findings of youth being@play with digital media and technology at 101 Technology Fun, two intensive one-week gaming and robotic research camps held in a technology-rich lab at the University of British Columbia. Child-technology interrelations are characterized according to a six-fold typology that draws from social, ethical and cognitive domains: recognition, feeling, attention, engagement, contact and attachment. My goal is to educe a sensitive attunement and thoughtful attentiveness towards understanding how youth act-in and perceive their being-in this milieu technique. I invite you to critically consider and to reflect deeply upon how today's youth are be-thinged [bedingt]: simultaneously dependent upon, inhabited by, immersed in, and indifferent to the digital media and technology in their lives [9]. If we take a step back and depart from our pre-determined views and the normative assumptions that legitimatize the already-known, might it be possible to think differently and to question the as-yet unimagined possibilities for technology to shape our children's worlds, particularly in ways that escape our scrutiny of thought?},

abstract = {Workplace collaborators make use of diverse types of documents and other resources. Traditionally, each type of document has been stored in its own repository, and people have had to manage multiple documents in multiple storage services. Workplace collaborators often have complex, ad hoc working relations that are partially executed through their shared documents. Traditionally, dependencies among documents and other objects have gone unrecorded, or have been stored in a piecemeal manner inside the documents, or have been objectified and rigidified in workflow engines. Workplace collaborators often need to coordinate with one another, both asynchronously and in real-time, and often in the context of their shared documents. Traditionally, people had no idea of the status of their collaborators, or they have had to consult other, unrelated services for awareness or presence information about their colleagues.We aim to change that. I will describe our research, findings, and possible futures of systems and services that are intended to unify the ways that people collaborate with and through shared documents. In our ActivityExplorer project, users innovated new ways of using our software, showing that a service with collections of shared documents, fine-grained access control, persistent communications, and real-time status information could serve diverse needs of a workplace of individuals, teams, and communities. Our Unified Activity Management project explored the harvesting of collective enactments, and their crystallization into work practices templates and rich placeholders for future collaborations. These ideas have led to successful technology transfer, and are making their way into products.In the course of this work, we sometimes found that simple ideas were much more popular than expected, paradoxically creating new challenges for users. I will describe two of those challenges, and our attempts to meet them. This new research has led us into domains of interruption management, machine learning, and very much into social computing, including technology transfer into another generation of collaboration products.People work together through direct communication and through shared documents. At every turn, people surprise us with their ingenuity and their ability to create new human and technological solutions with the systems that we offer them. I will close with a discussion of the concept of reinvention (innovation through usage), and how technology developers and users can learn from one another through cycles of development and usage, with innovative contributions from all parties at each turn of the cycle.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers have increasingly deployed autonomous and reliable robots long-term in various social contexts including the home. Our work provides a mixed-method approach for analyzing older adults' long-term robot usage data patterns combining quantitative data of robot usage logs with qualitative descriptions from participants' own experience. Overall, this provides a fuller picture to how older adults use and experience social robots in their homes. Our work involves a robot hosting period for at least a month (up to 12 months) in older adults' homes with an experience debrief session held a month into the robot hosting time period. We propose reflections on the novelty effect with respect to older adults' usage data and highlight feelings of guilt, the robot's proactivity and movement, meeting (or not meeting) user expectations, and the robot's persona as key aspects of the hosting experience that promoted usage or non-usage. Finally, we provide design guidelines for structuring future mixed-method long-term robot usage studies being mindful of ethical considerations in this space.},

On the basis of a pilot implementation of a system for coordinating the transport of patients by hospital porters, we investigate pilot implementation as a method for participatory design. We find that to foster participation and learning about user needs a pilot implementation must create a space for reflecting on use, in addition to the space for using the pilot system. The space for reflection must also exist during the activities preparing the use of the pilot system because the porters and nurses learned about their needs throughout the pilot implementation, not just during use. Finally, we discuss how the scope and duration of a pilot implementation influence the conditions for participation.},

abstract = {Physical touch (e.g., hugging, holding hands, petting an animal) plays a fundamental role in the provision of socio-emotional support. Touch-based interactions should thus be considered for socially assistive robots designed to provide similar support. However, the haptic properties of currently existing robots are limited. While research has shown possibilities of integrating life-like haptic cues (e.g., thermal, vibrotactile, pressure cues) into robotic interfaces, current understanding of user experiences with life-like haptic cues delivered by a robot, and their potential to regulate user affect, is insufficient. The current and proposed works investigate whether integrating life-like haptic cues into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) can enhance the socio-emotional support provided by socially assistive robots and improve the relationships with, and perceptions of such robots. The findings of this work will provide insights into user experiences of touching a socially assistive robot and their perceptions of life-like haptic cues. The contributions will provide concrete design suggestions on how haptic cues can be integrated into interfaces of socially assistive robots to enhance users' well-being during stress-inducing situations},

However, the capabilities for natural language generation demonstrated by the latest class of large language models (LLMs) highlight an opportunity to explore new forms of human-AI writing support tools. In this paper, we introduce LaMPost, a prototype email-writing interface that explores the potential for LLMs to power writing support tools that address the varied needs of people with dyslexia. LaMPost draws from our understanding of these needs and introduces novel AI-powered features for email-writing, including: outlining main ideas, generating a subject line, suggesting changes, rewriting a selection. We evaluated LaMPost with 19 adults with dyslexia, identifying many promising routes for further exploration (including the popularity of the “rewrite” and “subject line” features), but also finding that the current generation of LLMs may not surpass the accuracy and quality thresholds required to meet the needs of writers with dyslexia. Surprisingly, we found that participants’ awareness of the AI had no effect on their perception of the system, nor on their feelings of autonomy, expression, and self-efficacy when writing emails. Our findings yield further insight into the benefits and drawbacks of using LLMs as writing support for adults with dyslexia and provide a foundation to build upon in future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we motivate and introduce Futuristic Autobiographies, a method inspired by design fiction for eliciting values and perspectives on the future of technologies from participants such as users, designers, and researchers. Futuristic autobiographies are the creative work of the researchers and participants. Grounded in empirical and background work, researchers pose several stories involving the participant as a character about a future state with robots. Participants are then asked to weave fictional autobiographies to explain what led to this future state. Via a case study in which futuristic autobiographies were used with 23 roboticists, we detail the process involved in developing and implementing this method. When futuristic autobiographies are employed and carefully crafted from background research, they allow informants to speak for themselves on how their practices and values are intertwined now and in the future. We highlight both the benefits and challenges of futuristic autobiographies as a way to elicit rich stories about values. We argue that futuristic autobiographies are a promising addition to the current qualitative methods toolkit used in HRI.},

abstract = {The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data-driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well-defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Existing work has focused on harassment (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, two key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) detection timeliness, which is necessary to support victims as early as possible, and (ii) scalability to the staggering rates at which content is generated in online social networks. In this work, we introduce CONcISE, a novel approach for timely and accurate Cyberbullying detectiON in online social media SEssions. CONcISE is a two-stage online approach designed to reduce the time to raise a cyberbullying alert by sequentially examining comments as they become available over time, and minimizing the number of feature evaluations necessary for a decision to be made for each comment. Extensive experiments on a real-world Instagram dataset with users and comments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and timeliness of our approach and its benefits over existing methods. Additional experiments using a Twitter dataset offer evidence in support of the potential generalizability of CONcISE to other social media platforms.},

abstract = {Digital humanities methods and techniques have been applied to a wide spectrum of disciplines with results there were not attainable otherwise. However, uncertainty is present in any DH endeavour, in various types and degrees, due to the very nature of both humanist research and the intervention of computers to enable such kind of research methodologies. On the one hand, information sources need to be converted into digital form and, on the other hand, the resulting digital objects are processed to obtain summaries, geographic and temporal distributions, networks, patterns, etc., that are presented to and interpreted by the researchers or users of the DH projects. From the digitalization to the interpretation, both the computational and cognitive steps involved are subject to uncertainty. The track "Uncertainty in Digital Humanities" of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2018), tries to bring together researchers in Digital Humanities and reflect on the opportunities and challenges related to the way in which uncertainty can be better understood and pave the way towards appropriate methods and tools of dealing with uncertainty that improve the support to humanists when generating new knowledge.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of inferring the design intentions of a human by an intelligent virtual agent that collaborates with the human. First, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network model that relates design intentions, objectives, and solutions during a human's exploration of a problem space. We then train the model on design behaviors generated by a search agent and use the model parameters to infer the design intentions in a test set of real human behaviors. We find that our model is able to infer the exact intentions across three objectives associated with a sequence of design outcomes 31.3% of the time. Inference accuracy is 50.9% for the top two predictions and 67.2% for the top three predictions. For any singular intention over an objective, the model's mean F1-score is 0.719. This provides a reasonable foundation for an intelligent virtual agent to infer design intentions purely from design outcomes toward establishing joint intentions with a human designer. These results also shed light on the potential benefits and pitfalls in using simulated data to train a model for human design intentions.},

We follow a typical par- ticipatory design approach including experts and patients in order to address requirements from both sides. Since the success of such treatments is related to a patients emotion regulation capabilities, we employ a real-time social signal interpretation together with a computational simulation of emotion regulation that influences the agent's social behavior as well as the situational selection of verbal treatment strategies. Overall, our interdisciplinary approach sketches a novel integrative concept for Social Agents as assistants for burn-out patients.},

abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

At the same time we make an argument for adopting a research through design approach. Our stance suggests that by viewing robots as composed of design materials we can sensitively address and in the long run perhaps even avoid wicked problems related to robotics.},

abstract = {Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers (n = 50), which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9781538685556},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Many new technologies are being built to support people with dementia. However, they largely focus on the people with dementia; consequently, informal caregivers, one of the most important stakeholders in dementia care, remain invisible within the technology design space. In this paper, we present a six-month long, community-based design research process where we collaborated with dementia caregiver support groups to design robots for dementia caregiving. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we broaden the context of dementia robot design to give a more prominent role to informal family caregivers in the co-design process. Second, we provide new design guidelines that contextualize robots within the family caregiving paradigm, which suggest new roles and behaviors of robots. These include lessening emotional labor by communicating information caregivees do not want to hear (e.g., regarding diet or medication) or providing redirection during emotionally difficult times, as well as facilitating positive shared moments. Third, our work found connections between certain robot attributes and their relationship to the stage of dementia a caregivee is experiencing. For example, caregivers wanted their robots to facilitate interaction with their caregivees in early stages of dementia, yet be in the background. However, for later stages of dementia, they wanted robots to replace caregiver-caregivee interaction to lessen their emotional burden, and be foregrounded. These connections provide important insights in to how we think about adaptability and long-term interaction in HRI. We hope our work provides new avenues for HRI researchers to studying robots for dementia caregivers by engaging in community-based design.},

Previous work has also argued that mid-air gestural input can cause discomfort and arm fatigue over time, which can be addressed in a desktop setting by allowing users to gesture in alternative restful arm positions (e.g., elbow rests on desk). However, it is unclear if and how gesture preferences and gesture designs would be different for alternative arm positions. In order to inquire these research question we report on a user and choice based gesture elicitation study in which 10 participants designed gestures for different arm positions. We provide an in-depth qualitative analysis and detailed categorization of gestures, discussing commonalities and differences in the gesture sets based on a "think aloud" protocol, video recordings, and self-reports on user preferences.},

We demonstrate that whilst there are complex interactions between robot, user and observer gender, we were able to increase girls' perceptions of robot credibility and reduce gender bias in boys. We suggest our work provides positive evidence for going against current digital assistant/traditional human gender-based norms, and the future role robots might have in reducing our gender biases.},

To address this question, we review 95 articles containing persona application across multiple domains, and identify software development, healthcare, and higher education as the top domains that employ personas. We then present a three-stage design hierarchy of persona usage to describe how personas are used in design tasks. Finally, we assess the increasing trend of persona initiatives aimed towards social good rather than solely commercial interests. Our findings establish a roadmap of best practices for how practitioners can innovatively employ personas to increase the value of designs and highlight avenues of using personas for socially impactful purposes.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the user-centered design methodology and techniques used for the elicitation of user requirements and how these requirements informed the first phase of the user interface design for a Cross-Language Information Retrieval System. We describe a set of factors involved in analysis of the data collected and, finally discuss the implications for user interface design based on the findings.},

abstract = {This paper explores the creation and distribution of knowledge in communities that have emerged through a shared interest or goal. The focus is on the technology used for supporting knowledge creation and distribution. We examine the problem area through three case studies: birdwatchers, virtual stables and ice-hockey fans. As a result, we present an analysis of issues concerning knowledge creation and distribution from the viewpoints of interactivity, immersion, and connectivity.},
