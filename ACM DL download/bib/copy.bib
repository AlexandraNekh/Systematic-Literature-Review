abstract = {From healthcare to criminal justice, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

abstract = {A surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) has led to a vast collection of algorithmic work on the topic. While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.},

abstract = {The recent focus on user-driven innovation and open innovation signals a shift of concerns beyond the new product or service it self. The very model of how to make business is at play in most innovation projects today, in particular with the advent of Internet commerce. There are already examples of participatory design methods being applied to open up the process of business modeling to a wider circle of actors than those marketing managers that typically devise new business schemes. Traditional manufacturing companies with conventional product sales are challenged to consider alternative business models. Public organizations are under increasing pressure to consider themselves a business, with all that this entails in terms of new terminology.To allow people without formal business education to take part in business model discussions means moving beyond text and spreadsheets. Designers can play a crucial role here. But participatory design of business models could sound like a contradiction in terms: Do the designers side with the exploiting rather than the exploited?This workshop invites participants to bring experience from projects where business issues were part of the participatory negotiation, and to hone their position on the larger question of the role of PD in innovation.},

Computational alternatives are used to systematically question the technological status quo and peak into a possible future; they are material manifestations of our focus and curiosity and can aid us in inquiring into possible socio-technical alternatives. Ultimately we focus on whether (and how) it is possible to maintain a technological research agenda in participatory and user-centered design, without giving up on pursuit of strong conceptual and theoretical insights.},

abstract = {We reflect on how practices of care configure workplace participatory design (PD) efforts by locating ways in which care manifests in the ambitions of actors as they confront their ambivalent relations to a smart workplace technology. We explore these issues through a participatory design effort centered around the development and implementation of a machine learning (ML) system to support the work of IT architects employed by a large global company. Following an Agile approach, these IT architects actively shaped the project's trajectories, offering feedback on various system prototypes as well as the alignment between the project's various aims and their everyday work practices. Our findings center around six standpoints (strategizing, managing, building, researching, integrating, and transforming) that organize “matters of care” emerging from our twenty-three-month-long engagement with this project. Workers inhabited different standpoints at different times (and some, at times, simultaneously), revealing a dynamic and shifting orientation toward caring. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding contemporary workplace PD efforts.},

In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as "designers" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies.},

Many technology organizations recently have established research, design, and development centers in Africa and have initiated projects with the desire to engage the talent and imaginative futures of this diverse region. This panel brings together researchers and practitioners working in Africa who are helping to direct their organizations efforts to locate the "center of design" in the settings and milieu where they work. Panelist will offer their perspectives on what it has meant for them and their organization to situate research, design, and development in Africa with a focus on their efforts to integrate participatory approaches. In addition they will discuss how to strengthen ties among their organizations, academic researchers, and institutions that are committed to participatory design and development to address the particular challenges of the African region.},

Thus, several training and workshops are conducted in Africa to build the capacity in AI and ML. Despite the training initiatives in Africa, there is little or no research regarding the implementation of these technologies in the context, which focuses on how to overcome challenges related to technology. This paper bridges the gap by exploring the current status of AI implementation in Africa. We used an online questionnaire to examine AI initiatives in Africa governments, encountered challenges and possible solutions to address the problems. MAXQDA software was used to analyze raw data. We used findings from the ongoing empirical work to propose preliminary recommendations for successful AI/ML implementation to African governments.},

abstract = {The field of human robot interaction (HRI) is still relatively new and often borrows methods and principles from the more established field of HCI. HRI researchers are adopting HCI methods, however, these methodologies may need slight modifications and adaptations in order to better investigate the unique challenges of working in HRI. In this paper, we present our findings which utilised one such method: Participatory Design (PD) workshop. We held the workshop in our assistive living lab with ten stroke survivors. This workshop aimed to explore the design of new socially assistive robotic technologies that could be used to support stroke survivors in the home environment. Some of our findings were unanticipated, which suggested that some adaptations to the existing framework for PD workshops need to be revised in order to be useful to HRI research.},

abstract = {There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.},

Interest has increased among researchers investigating the potential link between CSR activity and financial performance. In this study, we propose a method of finding CSR activities related to corporate value using random forest, a machine-learning technique. The definition of CSR is ambiguous, so we used the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26000 framework as the basic standard for investigating companies, since it is a major guideline for CSR activities in Japan. Following this framework, we used 36 CSR activities as features. Results indicated that Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) is the most important activity in corporate value classification. We then used association analysis to clarify how CSR activities related to corporate value influence. Results indicated that documentation of CSR policy is often performed in parallel with other activities, whereas, stakeholder engagement is not.},

Advantages of simulation games lay in the provision of a safe training environment, where users are able to play, test and probe without serious consequences. At the same time, it is important to engage learners by providing a motivating, challenging environment, which becomes meaningful to the player when skills and knowledge acquired within the game are transferrable to real work tasks. With the use of a participatory game design approach, we developed an immersive, meaningful virtual training environment to improve situational awareness skills. Feedback of game developers as well as from test groups shows that the participatory approach to game development lead to a meaningful experience within an authentic virtual training environment. High functional and physical fidelity, a high degree of realism, compared with challenging game elements makes the developed serious game an appropriate training tool for situational awareness skills.},

This service was meant to come into play once the user had completed the mourning process and accepted the loss. Despite conducting User Interviews and Brainstorming intently upon design ideas, the outcome of ideation seemed to lack the appropriate mood and sensitivity that would suit someone who reminisces upon a dear departed. The authors then approached PD to gain a deeper understanding of user needs, sensibilities and better sensitivity towards the tone of the design while dealing with a delicate subject like fond reminiscence of a dear one who has passed on.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) poses complex challenges for user experience (UX) designers. Typically unpredictable and opaque, it may produce unforeseen outcomes detrimental to particular groups or individuals, yet simultaneously promise amazing breakthroughs in areas as diverse as medical diagnosis and universal translation. This results in a polarized view of ML, which is often manifested through a technology-as-monster metaphor. In this paper, we acknowledge the power and potential of this metaphor by resurfacing historic complexities in human-monster relations. We (re)introduce these liminal and ambiguous creatures, and discuss their relation to ML. We offer a background to designers' use of metaphor, and show how the technology-as-monster metaphor can generatively probe and (re)frame the questions ML poses. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed discussion of an early-stage generative design workshop inquiring into ML approaches to supporting student mental health and well-being.},

In an observational study of 12 participants exploring a complex design problem together with the robot, we find that human designers have to negotiate both the physical and the creative space with the machine. They also often ascribe social meaning to the robot's pragmatic behaviors. Based on these findings, we propose four considerations for future HRCD systems: managing the shared workspace, communicating preferences about design goals, respecting different design styles, and taking into account the social meaning of design acts.},

In this paper, we present DeepWear, a method using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for clothes design. The DNNs learn the feature of specific brand clothes and generate images then patterns instructed from the images are made, and an author creates clothes based on that. We evaluated this system by evaluating the credibility of the actual sold clothes on market with our clothes. As the result, we found it is possible to make clothes look like actual products from the generated images.

abstract = {Building service robots-robots that perform various services in buildings-are becoming more common in large buildings such as hotels and stores. We aim to leverage such robots to serve as guides for blind people. In this paper, we sought to design specifications that detail how a building service robot could interact with and guide a blind person through a building in an effective and socially acceptable way. We conducted participatory design sessions with three designers and five non-designers. Two of the designers and all of the non-designers had a vision disability. Primary features of the design include allowing the user to (1) summon the robot after entering the building, (2) choose from three modes of assistance (Sighted Guide, Escort, and Information Kiosk), and (3) receive information about the building's layout from the robot. We conclude with a discussion of themes and a reflection about our design process that can benefit robot design for blind people in general.},

abstract = {Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {Detrimental online behavior such as harassment and cyberbullying is becoming a serious, large-scale problem damaging people's lives. This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.},

abstract = {The research project, through experimentation with computer vision tools integrating machine learning models, will investigate how this technology can be used to develop human-object based theatrical performances. Using three case studies, a range of human-object interactions will be identified and explored for the development of a collaborative performance work, incorporating elements of improvised theatre, dance and interactive scenography. Theatrical practices, such as Overlie's Six Viewpoints, will be adopted in case study workshops and their utility in the design process assessed. The studies will investigate the processes of devised theatre and the potential role machine learning tools can play in providing creatives and museum curators with new modes of expression and discovery.},

Our observations and discussions with participants demonstrate the utility of IML as a tool for participatory design of accessible interfaces. This work has also led to a better understanding of challenges in end-user training of learning models, of how people develop personalised interaction strategies with different types of pre-trained interfaces, and of how properties of control spaces and input devices influence people's customisation strategies and engagement with instruments. This work has also uncovered similarities between the musical goals and practices of disabled people and those of expert musicians.},

abstract = {There are several machine learning suites that are readily-available. However, these applications require a basic foundation in machine learning making them appear difficult to configure. We introduce a sandbox approach with the goal of designing alternative programming interactions for machine learning tasks. A set of guidelines have been drafted and supported with user interviews to validate the proposed design framework. Ten students with novice machine learning experience participated in the study to formulate a programming pipeline that was used to draft the guidelines based on the literary review. A problem statement was formed from the analysis of interview insights using UX Research techniques. The insights suggest that a visual sandbox approach helps reduce the learning curve of programming machine learning tasks. The design guidelines we drafted focused on the three design factors namely system intent, interaction, and algorithm visualization. Considering these guidelines, a prototype was produced that will undergo future testing and validation.},

However, high quality, mainstream movement interaction requires effective tools and techniques to support designers. A promising approach to movement interaction design is Interactive Machine Learning, in which designing is done by physically performing an action. This article brings together many different perspectives on understanding human movement knowledge and movement interaction. This understanding shows that the embodied knowledge involved in movement interaction is very different from the representational knowledge involved in a traditional interface, so a very different approach to design is needed. We apply this knowledge to understand why interactive machine learning is an effective tool for motion interaction designers and to make a number of suggestions for future development of the technique.},

The framework is based on Multi-agent systems that allow engineers to synchronize their work by keeping track of their changes and facilitating the detection and management of semantic conflicts that arise when different actors are working in parallel. Conflicts are detected according of each engineers semantics which are defined by using OWL ontologies and SWRL rules. When they are detected, the framework allows solving them by negotiating possible alternatives. Then the alternatives are evaluated by expressing preferences and the picked alternative, being the one that maximizes the global welfare, is applied in all the models in the distributed environment. The system is completed with a machine learning module that allows the agents to suggest similar solutions to future conflicts with similar semantic context.},

In order to open up the full potential of ML for accessibility applications, we have to bridge the gap for non-expert people doubly caused by the technological understanding and their disabilities. In this work, we investigate how non-expert deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people understand ML technologies and design ML-based sound recognition systems. We conduct a workshop study consisting of an ML lecture and an interactive learning session using a sound recognition system. Through observations during the workshop and semi-structured interviews, we clarify that non-expert DHH people start to overcome the knowledge gap. They could obtain a more detailed understanding of ML technology and how to use sounds to train ML models.},

Within it, we will scrutinise the intersections of artificial intelligence(s) and cities - i.e. urban life, spaces, places, geographies, infrastructures, and practices - from a multidisciplinary, design-oriented perspective. There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two. Traditionally, this has been the realm of design; In this workshop, we ask what themes, questions and methods should be addressed by an emerging design-oriented urban AI research community?},

We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI. ConsultAI is a conversational assistant that can provide real-time decision support to OH physicians during clinical interviews. Based on this case study, we discussed stakeholder engagement in the design of IDSTs for OH physicians.},

abstract = {Algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 5 years since its deployment.},

The explainable AI (XAI) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. In addition, existing XAI research tends to focus on the individual level. Little is known about how people understand and explain AI-led decisions in the community context. Drawing from XAI and activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-AI interaction. We then present a case study of AI-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of AI-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of CSCW, HCI, and XAI.},

abstract = {Organizing and assigning papers into sessions within a large conference is a formidable challenge. Some conference organizers, who are typically volunteers, have utilized event planning software to ensure simple constraints, such as two people can not be scheduled to talk at the same time. In this work, we proposed utilizing natural language processing to find the topics within a corpus of conference submissions and then cluster them together into sessions. As a preliminary evaluation of this technique, we compare session assignments from previous conferences to ones generated with our proposed techniques.},

abstract = {Designing for interacting with data-driven approaches is a new challenge that PD will have to address. This paper presents a case of prototyping for automation of editors’ manual curating of the online front-page of a large newspaper. The editors make decisions about the presentation and placement of article teasers on the front-page. A new data-driven tool, which automates curating the front-page based on quantitative rankings, is about to be introduced. We have developed a prototype to discuss with the editors how they want support for carrying out their judgment-based decisions for a front-page with a good mix of news topics. We present concepts for discussing how manual tasks that interact with data-driven automation can be designed to be meaningful for people in their work.},

We describe the challenges, solutions reached and lessons learned whilst employing a participatory design (PD) approach in the development of a prototype computer therapy tool for people with aphasia, a communication disorder.Our approach was workshop based. During a series of participatory workshop sessions, five people with aphasia, employed as consultants, took part in game-playing activities followed by hands-on interaction with a series of iterative prototypes. The challenges we faced arose primarily from the consultants' difficulties with the production and comprehension of language, both textual and verbal, and with the retention of information. The strategies and techniques we devised to cope with these challenges evolved over the course of the workshop sessions. We discuss these and how to involve and empower users with cognitive impairments, in the context of a broadening scope of PD practices.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) has recently seen efforts to reinvigorate its political capacity, including reflections on the relations between its practices and institutions and a renewed political agenda in the contemporary stage of capitalism, such as the one of nourishing the common. This paper addresses both of these directions, questioning how a renewed political agenda of PD intersects the processes of institutioning in which PD itself takes part. To do that, we refer to an European-funded project called Commonfare, aimed at designing a digital platform fostering the emergence of a new economic model in the domain of the institutions of the welfare state. We conclude by discussing how a PD political agenda based on the critique of the current forms of capitalism aligns with or challenges existing institutional frames, supporting the emergence of new institutions.},

abstract = {Since 2014, a growing body of critical research has pointed out flaws in smart city development. It has been described as too technology-led and business-oriented, diminishing citizens' agency and causing digital divides. As the agenda keeps spreading, there is an urgent need to develop more participatory, inclusive and bottom-up approaches to balance interests of those currently in strong power positions, such as large corporations. Participatory design (PD) and participatory approaches in general have been suggested as a remedy, but they often tend to be local, small-scale and short-term. Therefore, their impacts are often modest as well. We suggest that we need to start thinking about ways to create scalable approaches that would grow the temporal and spatial impact of actions and practices that intend to increase citizens' understanding and control over new technologies, i.e. their technological agency. Without making sure that more people have adequate knowledge and sufficient control and mastery of technologies, societal discussion and ultimately, political decisions, are left to few experts. We explore the potential of public libraries to act as an ally and cooperation partner in participatory design and technology education in general, with a significant potential to broaden micro-level actions' impact.The paper consists of a broad literature review mapping the central challenges of current smart city development; this is followed with an introduction to the Finnish library system as a democratic project; finally, we present three examples of how libraries are carrying out technological education connected to emerging technologies, particularly to 3D printing, robotics and virtual reality. Our central argument is that there is a need to bridge micro-level actions, such as those connected to participatory design projects, with the macro-level technopolitical development by collaborating with meso-level actors and networks.},

ADMINS explores the potential of a conversational user interface (CUI) to reduce administrative burden and improve outcomes, by replacing static forms with written and spoken dialogue. Students with accessibility needs often face excessive administrative burden. A CUI could be beneficial in this context if designed to be fully accessible. At the same time, we recognise the broader potential of CUIs for these types of processes, and the project aims to understand the multiple opportunities and challenges, using participatory design, iterative development and trials evaluations.},

Primary caregivers report being able to better understand these individuals' non-traditional utterances than those less familiar with the individual such as teachers and community members. We present an eight-month multi-phase case study for a translational platform, ECHOS, that uses primary caregivers' unique knowledge to enhance communicative and affective exchanges between mvASD individuals and the broader community. Through iterative development and participatory design, we discovered that physiological sensors were impractical for long-term use, on-body audio was content rich and easily accessible, and a custom in-the-moment labeling app was transformative in obtaining accurate labels from caregivers for machine learning advancements. This paper presents the design methodology, results, and reflections from our case study and provides insights into development with and for the special needs community.},

This article discusses a user-centered approach for the design of interactive auditory feedback using interactive machine learning. We discuss Mapping through Interaction, a method for crafting sonic interactions from corporeal demonstrations of embodied associations between motion and sound. It uses an interactive machine learning approach to build the mapping from user demonstrations, emphasizing an iterative design process that integrates acted and interactive experiences of the relationships between movement and sound. We examine Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression for continuous movement recognition and real-time sound parameter generation. We illustrate and evaluate this approach through an application in which novice users can create interactive sound feedback based on coproduced gestures and vocalizations. Results indicate that Gaussian Mixture Regression and Hidden Markov Regression can efficiently learn complex motion-sound mappings from few examples.},

Yet, the discourse around AI has long been by experts and for experts. In this paper, we argue for a participatory approach towards designing human-AI interactions. We outline how we used design methodology to organise an interdisciplinary workshop with a diverse group of students – a workbook sprint with 45 participants from four different programs and 13 countries – to develop speculative design futures in five focus areas. We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach. We then conclude by laying out how others might use our findings and initiate their own workbook sprint to explore complex technologies in a human-centred way.},

We present lessons from a series of semi-structured interviews, participatory design (PD) workshops and prototype evaluation of a multi-party tenancy CUI - RITA. Preliminary findings indicate that trust can be enhanced in CUIs through greater transparency of actions, enhanced control and clearer privacy settings. It also suggests that design should account for the ways in which trust manifests in sensitive user contexts, like tenancies based on preestablished relationships and power dynamics.},

abstract = {When it comes to algorithmic rights and protections for children, designers will need to face new paradigms to solve problems they are targeting. The field of Design typically deals with form and function and is executed in molecules or pixels. But algorithms have neither. More importantly, algorithms may be biased in their execution against those without privileged status such as people of color, children, and the non-affluent. In this paper, we review our work on exploring perceptions of fairness in AI through co-design sessions with children of color in non-affluent neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The design sessions aimed at designing an artificially intelligent librarian for their local branch. Our preliminary findings showcase three key themes of this group's perceptions of fairness in the context of an artificially intelligent authority figure.},

However, there is a considerable gap between macro-level aims to include the civil society at large and Participatory Design (PD) methods to include citizens on the micro-level. Thus, we argue for meso-level approaches that would enable PD and education practitioners to build scalable methods of digital inclusion. We present the case of Virtual Library in Oulu City Library as a hands-on case study example in our workshop. In order to build scalable methods, we offer libraries as an example of a networked learning space to achieve this synergistically with an existing social and cultural service program, the public library system. We invite practitioners, educators and scholars from all backgrounds to explore, develop and critique meso-level approaches and networked learning spaces in their various cultural and national contexts of practice at this two-hour long workshop.},

Specifically, it describes and analyses the use of dotmocracy (from participatory design) and planning poker (from Agile frameworks) for decision-taking and uncertainty management in the early definition of collaborative research processes. The analysis, based on participant observation and facilitation in nine collaborative research settings, identifies commonalities on how some issues of uncertainty in collaborative knowledge generation contexts can be addressed by both techniques. Results point to the possibility of using dotmocracy and planning poker for articulating decision-making processes among different available options, in order to find consensus in a visual way, and at the same time to make more explicit the degree of agreement and risk perceptions in relation to scientific activities.},

abstract = {Concerns about "black box" machine learning algorithms have influenced why modern data protection laws and regulations on their establishment of a right to human intervention on decision-making supported by artificial intelligence. Such interventions provide data subjects with means to protect their rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, either as a bare minimum requirement for data processing or as a central norm governing decision-aiding artificial intelligence. In this paper, I present contestability by design as an approach to two kinds of issues with current legal implementations of the right to human intervention. The first kind is the uncertainty about what kind of decision should be covered by this right: should intervention be restricted to those decisions with no human involvement, or should it be interpreted in a broader sense, encompassing all decisions that are effectively shaped by automated processing? The second class of issues ensues from practical limitations of this right to intervention: even within a clear conceptual framework, data subjects might still lack the information they need to the concrete exercise of their right, or the human intervention itself might introduce biases and limitations that result in undesirable outcomes. After discussing how those effects can be identified and measured, I then advance the thesis that proper protection of the rights of data subjects is feasible only if there are means for contesting decisions based solely on automated processing is not an afterthought, but instead a requirement at each stage of an artificial intelligence system's lifecycle.},

We present a participatory design methodology for culturally tailoring virtual agents. Investigators worked with key informants from our target population, members of predominantly Black church communities, to design culturally-relevant and sensitive virtual agent health promotion interventions. In the first participatory session, key informants designed agents to assist them with different aspects of their lives, providing input on agent appearance and agent functionality. In a second design session, participants re-wrote the content of a health conversation with an agent, to include personally-relevant content related to their community (e.g., religious and scriptural references). We report design principles for religious tailoring derived from these studies. We conducted a validation study to assess the effects of applying these principles to agents that promoted two health behaviors, finding that participants responded very positively to the tailored agents.},

abstract = {Computer aided design (CAD), the use of computer systems for design and documentation, is prevalent in industrial and architectural design, but largely features passive software to follow user interaction. In the past decade, there have been multiple efforts in implementing multi-objective optimization algorithms and machine learning for data analytics in the area of computational optimization of building designs. This research initially explored the technical review of presented designs, and subsequently began to explore the creation of novel forms based on design constraints in addition to parameter optimization. Most notably in the conceptualization phase of the process, the designer is largely unassisted as current existing CAD software focuses on the modeling and basic structural analysis of already created designs. In this position paper, we propose a conceptual framework to leverage computer-assisted creativity in building and form design using evolutionary algorithms, complimented with a comprehensive review of the approaches of other research. We present the preliminary results of our rudimentary implementation of ArchiGen (Architectural Generator), a tool for assisting designers in the conceptualization of a design by presenting alternative forms based on design constraints. ArchiGen uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to create alternative designs of a pillar-pod-antenna structured observation tower as a case study and explores the potential of combining optimal and sub-optimal solutions based on the specified design constraints.},

As algorithmic decision making increasingly affects our lives, calls to improve the transparency of these systems are met with social, legal and technical limitations that challenge whether transparency alone is the solution to algorithmic accountability. In my dissertation, I explore the role of algorithmic tranparency, algorithmic literacy and related issues as approaches towards holding algorithmic systems more accountable. Bridging HCI and STS communities, my work is grounded in a critical ethnography of algorithmic systems and their impact on its stakeholders. Through this approach, I aim to provide both theoretical insights and material solutions to the problem of accountability. By unpacking the complex socio-technical assemblage that make up these systems and employing both participatory and user-centred design principles, my goal is to co-design measures that support sense-making of algorithmic processes and allow holding these systems accountable.},

The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network (AID-N) used participatory design methods to develop an electronic triage system that changed how emergency personnel interacted, collected, and processed data at mass casualty incidents. Through a collaboration between computer scientists, biomedical engineers, usability analysts, paramedics, and medical doctors, AID-N constructed scalable algorithms to monitor a large numbers of patients, an intuitive interface to support overwhelmed responders, and an ad-hoc mesh network that maintained connectivity to patients in ad-hoc, chaotic settings. This paper describes an iterative approach to user-centered design that allows for the collection of a massive amount of data and presents this data in a clear and understandable format to the user.},

These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.},

Children's understanding and response to emotions matures alongside their cognitive development. Any model of emotions embedded in an EPA will impact children's responses, and use of the EPA characters. Therefore EPA design should include both user characteristics and the pedagogical purposes behind the CAL system. This paper presents the participatory design of an EPA's affective responses to children's interaction with mathematical software. The participatory design sessions were performed with teachers as partners in designing the affective learning components. The results of a pilot study on children's responses to the emotional sequence defined in the model will be introduced, as a separate study. Finally, a plan of future research is presented to further validate the model's potential for CAL systems, including the integration two software learning applications constructed during the design sessions with teachers},

As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.},

We also discuss the viability of replication studies in participatory design and the need to engage other stakeholders besides older adults, such as clinicians, to provide practical robot applications.},

These promise to detect malicious skin changes from photos or respiratory diseases from cough noises captured by the smartphone microphone, for example. While there is a large body of research on HCI-related aspects of mobile health applications, knowledge about the user perceptions of such novel AI-driven self-diagnosis apps and factors affecting their acceptance and adoption is scarce. In an online survey, we investigated the participants’ overall willingness-to-use (considering four types of captured and processed data) and identified trust factors and desirable features. We found that more than half of the participants would use AI-driven self-diagnosis apps, yet mainly integrated into prevailing general practitioner care. Based on the results, we draw conclusions which can guide the design, development, and launch of AI-driven self-diagnosis apps.},

abstract = {Major natural or man-made disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the 9/11 terror attacks pose significant challenges for emergency responders. First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in the most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowd-sourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system.},

In this paper, we discuss how to design and structure a participatory design workshop and wizard of Oz with users, especially in the situation of developing a new presentation tool. Our approach to structure participatory design is to embed three phases based on principles of human-centered design. We extend the design method to achieve more useful and usable concepts. In the first phase, end-users engaged in building initial concepts. In the second phase, the users evaluated their initial idea and refined the design concepts. In the last phase, extended user groups gave feedback about usability issues in the tested platform. In the lessons learned, we highlight two major issues observed in this our design method: (a) evolving design fidelity and (b) comprehension of own design.},

Digital support for journalists when investigating and writing about science-related topics is one means of improving this science communication. However, little bespoke digital support is available. This paper reports the research and development of one new form of such digital support. During a participatory design process, experienced science journalists and other professionals were interviewed about their challenges experienced and understanding of good practices in science journalism. These challenges and good practices informed the development of a prototype of a new form of digital tool that was evaluated by journalists without specialist science training. A new version of the prototype, called INQUEST, was implemented to automate some parts of good practices in order to augment journalists’ capabilities. These practices included the retrieval of science information from diverse sources, targeting different science audiences, and providing different forms of guidance for explaining science to the target audience. This prototype is presented, and an early evaluation of it is reported.},

abstract = {City, municipal, and state governments around the globe are increasingly looking towards algorithmic solutions to long-standing and difficult problems in governance. We use the term algorithmic governance to capture this increasing use of predictive and other algorithms to provide efficiencies in the targeting of services and government processes. However, in the course of pursuing these efficiencies, openness, transparency, public accountability, and community-based deliberation, key pillars of democracy, come under threat when decision making is black-boxed in an algorithm. Furthermore, algorithmic governance (for example, in domains like welfare management) typically exacerbates the marginalization of the most disadvantaged in society, while simultaneously making such marginalization invisible to the larger citizenry. A hybrid technology assessment (TA) comprising of elements of both participatory TA (that involves public debate about technology) and constructive TA (that involves co-construction of technology between society and designers) employed through the framework of engineering technology for social justice, may help address these challenges.},

abstract = {Nonverbal vocalizations contain important affective and communicative information, especially for those who do not use traditional speech, including individuals who have autism and are non- or minimally verbal (nv/mv). Although these vocalizations are often understood by those who know them well, they can be challenging to understand for the community-at-large. This work presents (1) a methodology for collecting spontaneous vocalizations from nv/mv individuals in natural environments, with no researcher present, and personalized in-the-moment labels from a family member; (2) speaker-dependent classification of these real-world sounds for three nv/mv individuals; and (3) an interactive application to translate the nonverbal vocalizations in real time. Using support-vector machine and random forest models, we achieved speaker-dependent unweighted average recalls (UARs) of 0.75, 0.53, and 0.79 for the three individuals, respectively, with each model discriminating between 5 nonverbal vocalization classes. We also present first results for real-time binary classification of positive- and negative-affect nonverbal vocalizations, trained using a commercial wearable microphone and tested in real time using a smartphone. This work informs personalized machine learning methods for non-traditional communicators and advances real-world interactive augmentative technology for an underserved population.},

An interactive electronic format also allows including multiple languages without sacrificing space on a page for attractive images---both key features for teaching young children to read in a setting where multiple languages are spoken in the home, or where a mother tongue is not the language of instruction. This paper describes collaborative development of a digital, multi-language reading tool that facilitates translation of local stories by Kenyan community groups, led by a librarian, into a mother tongue. Despite being built faithfully using a well-established design methodology in an iterative process among beneficiaries, program leaders, and technologists, and in a process embedded in a program also designed according to those design standards, tool development has faced serious challenges. This paper uses a principal agent model to identify technology-mediated communication and spatial distance among critical participants as major hindrances to progress. Analysis reveals critical disparities between, on one hand, the design thinking of development practitioners and funders, which rhetorically promote a circular, dynamic, participatory design process, and, on the other hand, traditional funding structures which impose at least partial adherence to a top-down approach.},

abstract = {Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.},

abstract = {Words and language are central to most human communication. This paper explores the importance of language for the participatory design of smart home technologies for healthcare. We argue that to effectively involve a broad range of users in the design of new technologies, it is important to actively develop a shared language that is accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that facilitates productive dialogues among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly in work with end users, in which problematic language emerged as a key barrier to participation and effective design. Three specific categories of language barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words. Building on this we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on generating a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that emerged of alternative terminology and specific strategies for creating a shared language.},

abstract = {Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers' disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers' disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts. We conclude with critical reflections about the ethics of responsible designs of such studies.},

abstract = {Inclusivity is central to Participatory Design (PD) practice, but despite significant efforts in IDC and beyond, it is still hard to achieve during PD, because of a series of barriers (e.g. access to users, language). Such barriers increase especially when it comes to ensuring and supporting the participation of children with varying or complex needs, or when prospective participants are geographically distributed. This workshop aims to create the basis of a distributed PD (DPD) protocol to provide practical advice in overcoming the challenges of ensuring inclusivity for children with varying or complex needs around the world. The protocol will build on the participants' prior experience and on a live PD design session with children and adults, and be guided by discussions around approaches to address a specific design problem while maximising inclusivity across geographical boundaries and research contexts. It is intended to become a springboard for the world's most inclusive Distributed PD project.},

In these so-called "bottom-up" approaches, users are becoming designers of their game experience. In this paper, we report on an online study where participants (n=140) described a gamification concept, without restricting them to a set of game elements to select from. This was done to analyze how they perform in such a task. The concepts were qualitatively evaluated for which game elements were proposed, showing that participants suggested many diverse concepts with a broad range of elements. The results provide further support for "bottom-up" approaches. Additionally, the suggested game elements were compared to every participant's Hexad user type and Big Five personality. Our data hints that both seem not to be dominant factors influencing which elements participants use in such a design task.},

Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

To better understand children's awareness of online stranger danger and explore their visions for technologies that can help them manage related online risks (e.g., sexual solicitations and cyberbullying), we held two participatory design sessions with 12 children (ages 8-11 years old). We found that children desired varying levels of agency, depending on the severity of the risk. In most cases, they wanted help resolving the issue themselves instead of relying on their parents to do it for them. Children also believed that social media apps should take on more responsibility in promoting online safety for children. We discuss the children's desires for agency, privacy, and automated intelligent assistance and provide novel design recommendations inspired by children.},

Our research aims to design and develop a self-monitoring, ability-reactive technology (SMART) for users with AMD to support their dietary-based AMD risk mitigation and progression retardation over time. In this paper, we reflect on our experience of adapting and applying a participatory design (PD) approach to support the effective design of our application with and for older adults with AMD. We introduce the outcome of a series of PD sessions with older adults with AMD -- that is, a paper prototype of our proposed application which focuses on accessibility for our target users -- and discuss implications for the eventual prototype development.},

The potential to foster new forms of multisensory interaction through various sensor, mobile and haptic technologies is promising in providing new ways for young children to engage with key mathematical concepts. However, designing effective learning environments for real world classrooms is challenging, and requires a pedagogically, rather than technologically, driven approach to design. This paper describes initial work underpinning the development of a pedagogical framework, intended to inform the design of a multisensory serious gaming environment. It identifies the theoretical basis of the framework, illustrates how this informs teaching strategies, and outlines key technology research driven perspectives and considerations important for informing design. An initial table mapping mathematical concepts to design, a framework of considerations for design, and a process model of how the framework will continue to be developed across the design process are provided.},

abstract = {Esports (competitive videogames) have grown into a global phenomenon with over 450m viewers and a 1.5bn USD market. Esports broadcasts follow a similar structure to traditional sports. However, due to their virtual nature, a large and detailed amount data is available about in-game actions not currently accessible in traditional sport. This provides an opportunity to incorporate novel insights about complex aspects of gameplay into the audience experience – enabling more in-depth coverage for experienced viewers, and increased accessibility for newcomers. Previous research has only explored a limited range of ways data could be incorporated into esports viewing (e.g. data visualizations post-match) and only a few studies have investigated how the presentation of statistics impacts spectators’ experiences and viewing behaviors. We present Weavr, a companion app that allows audiences to consume data-driven insights during and around esports broadcasts. We report on deployments at two major tournaments, that provide ecologically valid findings about how the app’s features were experienced by audiences and their impact on viewing behavior. We discuss implications for the design of second-screen apps for live esports events, and for traditional sports as similar data becomes available for them via improved tracking technologies.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Robots are being increasingly developed as social actors, entering public and personal spaces such as airports, shopping malls, care centres, and even homes, and using human or animal-like social techniques to work with people. Some even aim to engineer social situations, or are designed specifically for an emotional response (e.g., comforting a person). However, if we consider these robots as social interventions, then it is important to recognize that the robots design - its behavior, its application, its appearance, even its marketing image - will have an impact on the society and in the spaces it enters. While in some cases this may be a positive effect, social robots can also contribute negatively, e.g., reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting ageist views. This full-day workshop aims to offer a forum for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers to explore this issue, and to work toward potential opportunities for the field. Ultimately, we want to promote robots for social good that can contribute to positive social changes for socio-political issues (e.g., ageism, feminism, homelessness, environmental issues). The political aspects of technologies have long been scrutinized in related areas such as Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In particular, critical design explicitly targets the design of technologies that can contribute to our understanding of how technology can impact society. This workshop aims to strengthen this discussion in the HRI community, with the goal of working toward initial recommendations for how HRI designers can include elements of critical design in their work.},

We analyzed idea types and could show that players did not change an idea voting scheme based on up- and down-votes and were more focused on changing the game than any other component. In contrast, features that would improve the community feeling or would help to improve ideas of others were not often suggested or selected. Nonetheless, the experience was rated as quite enjoyable by players, showing the appeal of such a player-driven game design approach and the relevancy for further research in this context.},

Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.},

While the goal of critical technical practice as proposed by [1] is to overcome technical impasses, I explore an alternative use case - ensuring that technical research is aligned with social values. In the design of AI systems, we generally start with a technical formulation of a problem and then attempt to build a system that addresses that problem. Critical technical practice tells us that this technical formulation is always founded upon the discipline's core discourse and ontology, and that difficulty in solving a technical problem might just result from inconsistencies and faults in those core attributes. What I hope to show with this project is that, even when a technical problem seems solvable, critical technical practice can and should be used to ensure the human-compatibility of the technical research.},

abstract = {Current advances in machine translation increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and improves quality. This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Our results of an elicitation study with professional translators indicate that a combination of pen, touch, and speech could well support common PE tasks, and received high subjective ratings by our participants. Therefore, we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other hand, eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected during PE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel sociotechnical moderation system for Reddit called Crossmod. Through formative interviews with 11 active moderators from 10 different subreddits, we learned about the limitations of currently available automated tools, and how a new system could extend their capabilities. Developed out of these interviews, Crossmod makes its decisions based on cross-community learning---an approach that leverages a large corpus of previous moderator decisions via an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, we deployed Crossmod in a controlled environment, simulating real-time conversations from two large subreddits with over 10M subscribers each. To evaluate Crossmod's moderation recommendations, 4 moderators reviewed comments scored by Crossmod that had been drawn randomly from existing threads. Crossmod achieved an overall accuracy of 86% when detecting comments that would be removed by moderators, with high recall (over 87.5%). Additionally, moderators reported that they would have removed 95.3% of the comments flagged by Crossmod; however, 98.3% of these comments were still online at the time of this writing (i.e., not removed by the current moderation system). To the best of our knowledge, Crossmod is the first open source, AI-backed sociotechnical moderation system to be designed using participatory methods.},

abstract = {Gathering representative data using mobile sensing to answer research questions is becoming increasingly popular, driven by growing ubiquity and sensing capabilities of mobile devices. However, there are pitfalls along this path, which introduce heterogeneity in the gathered data, and which are rooted in the diversity of the involved device platforms, hardware, software versions and participants. Thus, we, as a research community, need to establish good practices and methodologies for addressing this issue in order to help ensure that, e.g., scientific results and policy changes based on collective, mobile sensed data are valid. In this paper, we aim to inform researchers and developers about mobile sensing data heterogeneity and ways to combat it. We do so via distilling a vocabulary of underlying causes, and via describing their effects on mobile sensing---building on experiences from three projects within citizen science, crowd awareness and trajectory tracking.},

However, this is not yet commonplace in Learning Analytics (LA). Co-design techniques from other domains therefore have much to offer to LA, in principle, but there are few detailed accounts of exactly how such sessions unfold. This paper presents the rationale driving a card-based co-design tool specifically tuned for LA, called LA-DECK. In the context of a pilot study with students, educators, LA researchers and developers, we provide qualitative and quantitative accounts of how participants used the cards. Using three different forms of analysis (transcript-centric design vignettes, card-graphs and time-on-topic), we characterise in what ways the sessions were "participatory" in nature, and argue that the cards succeeded in playing very similar roles to those documented in the literature on successful card-based design tools.},

However, context and embodiment are relevant to moral decision-making. Due to the potential to immerse participants in a simulated environment, purpose-built games and scenarios might prove valuable as empirical tools. As a case study of gamifying bioethics, we describe the co-design and implementation of "What Lies Ahead?", a digital role-play scenario for research with adolescents. "What Lies Ahead?" engages young people with ethical issues related to predictive technologies in psychiatry. As preliminary evidence of the validity of this gamified approach, we report qualitative results suggesting that the role-play was immersive, and elicited authentic responses and reflective thinking in adolescent participants. Even though application of game-play mechanics is rare in bioethics, we find digital role-play to be a powerful tool that collects data through real-time, realistic scenarios.},

We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs’ potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.},

abstract = {Delivering a presentation has been reported as one of the most anxiety-provoking tasks faced by English Language Learners. Researchers suggest that instructors should be more aware of the learners' emotional states to provide appropriate emotional and instructional scaffolding to improve their performance when presenting. Despite the critical role of instructors in perceiving the emotional states among English language learners, it can be challenging to do this solely by observing the learners? facial expressions, behaviors, and their limited verbal expressions due to language and cultural barriers. To address the ambiguity and inconsistency in interpreting the emotional states of the students, this research focuses on identifying the potential of using biosensor-based feedback of learners to support instructors. A novel approach has been adopted to classify the intensity and characteristics of public speaking anxiety and foreign language anxiety among English language learners and to provide tailored feedback to instructors while supporting teaching and learning. As part of this work, two further studies were proposed. The first study was designed to identify educators' needs for solutions providing emotional and instructional support. The second study aims to evaluate a resulting prototype as a view of instructors to offer tailored emotional and instructional scaffolding to students. The contribution of these studies includes the development of guidance in using biosensor-based feedback that will assist English language instructors in teaching and identifying the students' anxiety levels and types while delivering a presentation.},

We found the children were able to grasp the representational nature of the task. Their ideas were playful and inspired by magical thinking. Their work forced us to reflect on and revisit our own design assumptions. The tasks have had a direct impact on the design of the assessment.},

Researchers have used machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to solve hard problems in a variety of domains.

In particular, we here show how, without any specific customization, it has been possible to employ the machine and deep learning algorithms offered by the publicly available platforms, to solve a fitness exercise classification problem, obtaining performances that would have been deemed remarkable until not long ago.},

The argument begins with a discussion of the parallels in design studies and cognitive science as each begun to consider the importance of environmental influences in how we design and how we think. By applying three situated frameworks to understand the situated nature of design meetings, the analysis shows that notions of social creation and cultural cognition are complimentary and necessary when trying to understand how the design process works.},

From this we identify modifiable aspects: problem statement, ideation, technology introduction and outputs.

abstract = {As more children's technologies are designed to be used with a global audience, new tools need to be created to include more children's voices in the design process. However, working with those children who are geographically distributed as design partners is difficult because existing technologies either do not support distributed design, or are not child-friendly. Industries that produce items for children to consume have begun using traditionally academic co-design techniques in order to design new products and experiences for children. As these groups need to reach out to more diverse and global populations, they will begin using technologies that support distributed co-design. As child-computer interaction researchers, we have a duty to understand this concept and identify recommendations for others to use that incorporate the ideals of our field. In order to do this, this paper describes the design process of an online environment to support geographically distributed, intergenerational co-design. Within this environment, children can work together despite differences of time zones, geographic location, or availability. The online environment was deployed for eight weeks during the summer and was modified each week throughout that time to better support the participants. Based on the experiences of participants within the environment, we make suggestions for new technologies including user management tools, creative expression tools, and ad hoc team membership that encourage more voices in the design process.},

abstract = {With the development of service-oriented computing environments, more and more Web services have become available. Service providers have to consider how to design composite services to meet requirements from various users. However, QoS of composite service is difficult to evaluate and predict due to the uncertainty and multiple metrics of QoS, which makes it necessary for user-centered design of composite services. Moreover, combining human services and Web services is becoming an important issue in service composition in cases that Web services cannot meet the requirements from users. Therefore, it is necessary to test the service composition environments for human-computer interaction and study human behaviors. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a participatory service design approach based on user-centered QoS considering a real-world case of field-based multi-language communication service design. To achieve this goal, we first describe the QoS model for service design considering users' requirements. Then, we propose the participatory service design process, consisting of service model refinement, participatory simulation, QoS evaluation and QoS data update. Finally, we use the field study of multi-language service design for Vietnamese agricultural knowledge communication to illustrate our proposed design methodology.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation aims to ameliorate deficits in motor control via intensive practice with the affected limb. Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers. We present the initial quantitative results, which support several aspects of our design rationales and conclude with our future study plans.},

In this paper, such a CPS named D&amp;RSense has been proposed to promote smart transportation in order to make travelling more comfortable and safe. By studying driving patterns of drivers, D&amp;RSense can get valuable insights to their braking and accelerating styles which can help to give them real-time warnings when they drive aggressively. Detection of rash driving prone areas across the city can help to recommend which areas of the city need stricter surveillance. D&amp;RSense involves smartphones of commuters and utilizes their accelerometer and GPS sensors to detect driving events like braking and acceleration as well as poor road conditions like bumps and potholes by applying the ensemble learning method for classification, Random Forest (RF). The accuracy of the same has been compared to other supervised machine learning classifiers like Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Rash-driving prone areas and poor road segments during the course of the experiment have been plotted using Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Effectiveness of the proposed application has been evaluated through extensive testing.},

Based on the resulting insights and ideas, we implemented a first prototype that balances individual feedback visualizations with detailed user profiles, a user journey and a communication feature. The prototype was assessed in seven focus groups with a total of 26 participants and with the AttrakDiff questionnaire. We found out that the persona view, the user journey view and the flexible filters of our prototype allowed designers to gain a insightful picture of users' experiences. Future work is needed to better understand how digitally-mediated empathic relationships evolve over the long term.},

Within educational applications, recent empirical research has shown that signal-level features of students’ writing, such as stroke distance, pressure and duration, are adapted to conserve total energy expenditure as they consolidate expertise in a domain. The present research examined how accurately three different machine-learning algorithms could automatically classify users’ domain expertise based on signal features of their writing, without any content analysis. Compared with an unguided machine-learning classification accuracy of 71%, hybrid methods using empirical-statistical guidance correctly classified 79–92% of students by their domain expertise level. In addition to improved accuracy, the hybrid approach contributed a causal understanding of prediction success and generalization to new data. These novel findings open up opportunities to design new automated learning analytic systems and student-adaptive educational technologies for the rapidly expanding sector of commercial pen systems.},

abstract = {The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design.This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO’s utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.},

We present a novel method -- in situ design -- to support ecologically valid design, and demonstrate its use through the co-development with 9 individuals with bipolar disorder of MoodRhythm, a mobile application designed to track and stabilize daily routines. We provide evidence that mHealth design elements tailored to the characteristics and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder can result in engaging interactions.},

abstract = {Smart homes have long been proposed as a viable mechanism to promote independent living for older adults in the home environment. Despite tremendous progress on the technology front, there has been limited uptake by end-users. A critical barrier to the adoption of smart home technology by older adults is the lack of engagement of end-users in the development process and the resulting one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to recognize the specific needs of the older adult demographic. In this paper, we propose a novel online platform aimed at closing the gap between older adults and technology developers: ASPIRE (Alignment of Social Personas in Inclusive Research Engagement). ASPIRE is an online collaborative network (OCN) that allows older adults, care partners, and developers to engage in the design and development of a joint shared product: the smart-home solution. To promote the adoption of the OCN and the alignment of this collaborative network with the values and emotional needs of its end-users, ASPIRE harnesses a social-psychological theory of identity. This paper presents ASPIRE as a conceptual model, with a preliminary implementation.},

Both frameworks define a series of "pragmatic dimensions" of ontologies. Because our derived framework does not cover all possible dimensions, we propose to complement it, by relying on existing work from the Ontology Engineering community in general, and from the Pragmatic Web community in particular. In conclusion, we invite the Pragmatic Web community to pursue such a work by jointly elaborating a consensual "Pragmatic Ontology Framework".},

This preserves the simplicity of paper or a whiteboard whilst adding the ability to capture early design ideas in a reusable way. This is a very lightweight modeling environment ideally suited to introducing students to Object Oriented Design.},

abstract = {Although rapid advances in machine learning have made it increasingly applicable to expert decision-making, the delivery of accurate algorithmic predictions alone is insufficient for effective human-AI collaboration. In this work, we investigate the key types of information medical experts desire when they are first introduced to a diagnostic AI assistant. In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.},

This program is designed for pregnant women in rural Assam in India. We observed the gestures of 24 pregnant women to determine how to present the following seven computational functions that were used in the health information program: Select, Pause, Resume, Help, Activate Menu, Next, and Previous. The participants belonged to the low socio-economic strata in rural Assam, India and most had poor literacy levels. A participatory approach through a user-generated gesture collection method was used for this study. This study produced a total of 49 different gestures that participants performed to represent the seven computational functions. We selected seven body gestures based on the frequency of use, logical suitability to represent functions, the decreased possibility that the gestures would be accidently performed (false positives), and the ease of detection for the chosen technology (technical limitations).},

Whilst a number of social human-robot interaction (HRI) studies have investigated the impact of different robot behaviours in compliance gaining/persuasion (e.g. [4]--[7]); established strategies for maximising this are yet to emerge, and it is unclear to what extent theories and strategies from HHI might apply.},

abstract = {Iterative user-centred design has become a standard approach for developing interactive products. This process relies on prototyping and usertesting as early as possible to deliver a positive user experience and ensure that final products align with designers' intentions. The video game industry has benefited greatly from this design approach, with games user researchers adapting and introducing various evaluation techniques. However, repeatedly creating game builds suitable for usertesting (i.e., high-fidelity prototypes) is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, recruiting users and conducting evaluation sessions are labour-intensive tasks. These challenges are especially pressing in the evaluation of game level and world design, where designers may wish to evaluate many alternatives or rapidly measure the impact of many small design changes on a game's ability to deliver the intended experience. To support developers grappling with these challenges, we have developed PathOS, a novel tool for simulating testing sessions with agents that model player navigation. This paper reports on our development objectives, implementation, and a user study with professional game developers to assess PathOS' application in a level design context. Our results demonstrate the ability of an automated testing tool to enhance the workflow of practicing developers.},

abstract = {This study is part of a larger project that showed the potential of our mixed reality (MR) system in fostering social initiation behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). We compared it to a typical social intervention strategy based on construction tools, where both mediated a face-to-face dyadic play session between an ASC child and a non-ASC child. In this study, our first goal is to show that an MR platform can be utilized to alter the nonverbal body behavior between ASC and non-ASC during social interaction as much as a traditional therapy setting (LEGO). A second goal is to show how these body cues differ between ASC and non-ASC children during social initiation in these two platforms. We present our first analysis of the body cues generated under two conditions in a repeated-measures design. Body cue measurements were obtained through skeleton information and characterized in the form of spatio-temporal features from both subjects individually (e.g. distances between joints and velocities of joints), and interpersonally (e.g. proximity and visual focus of attention). We used machine learning techniques to analyze the visual data of eighteen trials of ASC and non-ASC dyads. Our experiments showed that: (i) there were differences between ASC and non-ASC bodily expressions, both at individual and interpersonal level, in LEGO and in the MR system during social initiation; (ii) the number of features indicating differences between ASC and non-ASC in terms of nonverbal behavior during initiation were higher in the MR system as compared to LEGO; and (iii) computational models evaluated with combination of these different features enabled the recognition of social initiation type (ASC or non-ASC) from body features in LEGO and in MR settings. We did not observe significant differences between the evaluated models in terms of performance for LEGO and MR environments. This might be interpreted as the MR system encouraging similar nonverbal behaviors in children, perhaps more similar than the LEGO environment, as the performance scores in the MR setting are lower as compared to the LEGO setting. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of full body interaction and MR settings for children with ASC.},

We introduce Scones, a mixed-initiative, machine-learning-driven system that enables users to iteratively author sketches from text instructions. Scones is a novel deep-learning-based system that iteratively generates scenes of sketched objects composed with semantic specifications from natural language. Scones exceeds state-of-the-art performance on a text-based scene modification task, and introduces a mask-conditioned sketching model that can generate sketches with poses specified by high-level scene information. In an exploratory user evaluation of Scones, participants reported enjoying an iterative drawing task with Scones, and suggested additional features for further applications. We believe Scones is an early step towards automated, intelligent systems that support human-in-the-loop applications for communicating ideas through sketching in art and design.},

This paper considers how consumers might relate to these future smart grids within the UK. To address this challenge we exploited a combination of demonstration and animated sketches to convey the nature of a future smart energy infrastructure based on software agents. Users' reactions suggested that although they felt an obligation to engage with energy issues, they were principally disinterested. Users showed a considerable lack of trust in energy companies raising a dilemma of design. While users might welcome agents to help in engaging with complex energy infrastructures, they had little faith in those that might provide them. This suggests the need to consider how to design software agents to enhance trust in these socio-economic settings.},

Software architecture is critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps. Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.},

Here, most use cases focus on serving customer needs autonomously. Frequently, human intervention becomes necessary to support the robot in exceptional situations. However, direct intervention of service operators is often not possible and requires specialized personnel. In a co-design process with 13 service operators from a pharmacy, we designed a remote working environment for human-robot collaboration that enables first-time experiences and collaboration with robots. Five participants took part in an assessment study and reported on their experiences about the utility, usability and user experience. Results show that participants were able to control and train the robot through the remote control environment. We discuss implications of our results for future work in service domains and emphasize a shift of focus from full robot automatization to human-robot collaboration forms.},

However, passive sensing often struggles with noisy data, ambiguous feedback and weak user agency over the device, whilst self-reporting relies on user-entered data which can be time consuming and cognitively demanding. To address these limitations, we explore a different approach, whereby individuals consciously actuate personal data capture and are in control of it at all times; yet, the interaction solely involves clicking a button, thus avoiding cognitive overload whilst supporting immediate reflection. We call this approach intentive computing. Through our initial investigations we found that conscious interactions cannot only provide real-time relief in anxiety management, but can also function as memory anchors irrespective of the content captured and even prior to data visualization.},

abstract = {Developing information technology to democratize scientific knowledge and support citizen empowerment is a challenging task. In our case, a local community suffered from air pollution caused by industrial activity. The residents lacked the technological fluency to gather and curate diverse scientific data to advocate for regulatory change. We collaborated with the community in developing an air quality monitoring system which integrated heterogeneous data over a large spatial and temporal scale. The system afforded strong scientific evidence by using animated smoke images, air quality data, crowdsourced smell reports, and wind data. In our evaluation, we report patterns of sharing smoke images among stakeholders. Our survey study shows that the scientific knowledge provided by the system encourages agonistic discussions with regulators, empowers the community to support policy making, and rebalances the power relationship between stakeholders.},

abstract = {As computing moves into every aspect of our daily lives, the values and assumptions that underlie our technical practices may unwittingly be propagated throughout our culture. Drawing on existing critical approaches in computing, we argue that reflection on unconscious values embedded in computing and the practices that it supports can and should be a core principle of technology design. Building on a growing body of work in critical computing, reflective design combines analysis of the ways in which technologies reflect and perpetuate unconscious cultural assumptions, with design, building, and evaluation of new computing devices that reflect alternative possibilities. We illustrate this approach through two design case studies.},

abstract = {In society today, people experiencing disability can face discrimination. As artificial intelligence solutions take on increasingly important roles in decision-making and interaction, they have the potential to impact fair treatment of people with disabilities in society both positively and negatively. We describe some of the opportunities and risks across four emerging AI application areas: employment, education, public safety, and healthcare, identified in a workshop with participants experiencing a range of disabilities. In many existing situations, non-AI solutions are already discriminatory, and introducing AI runs the risk of simply perpetuating and replicating these flaws. We next discuss strategies for supporting fairness in the context of disability throughout the AI development lifecycle. AI systems should be reviewed for potential impact on the user in their broader context of use. They should offer opportunities to redress errors, and for users and those impacted to raise fairness concerns. People with disabilities should be included when sourcing data to build models, and in testing, to create a more inclusive and robust system. Finally, we offer pointers into an established body of literature on human-centered design processes and philosophies that may assist AI and ML engineers in innovating algorithms that reduce harm and ultimately enhance the lives of people with disabilities.},

However, the way in which such disruptive technologies could be deployed in various areas of digital government needs systematic investigation to understand emerging research and training needs. Future scenarios can be used as a method to elicit potential future evolutions of new technologies. In this paper, we suggest a future scenarios technique to identify research and training needs along the introduction of new disruptive technologies in the public sector. The paper describes the methodology of this scenario approach and an exemplification of identifying research and training needs relating to the implementation of Internet of things in public service provisioning, based on the application of the scenario approach. The methodology foresees expert engagement in the interactive workshops aimed at identification and prioritisation of the needs through a moderated discussion of the pre-constructed future scenarios. The methodology proved to be a useful tool for the identification of the research and training needs based on the expert input and produced useful and useable results during its application.},

abstract = {Affective computing is an imperative topic for Human-Computer Interaction, where user emotions and emotional communication can be utilized to improve the usability of a system. Several strategies are available to detect user emotions but it is questionable when identifying the most suitable and compatible strategy which can be used to detect emotions when using mobile devices. Multimodal emotion recognition paves the path to detect emotions by combining two or more strategies in order to identify the most meaningful emotion. Emotion identification through facial expressions and text analytics has given high accuracies but combining them and practically applying them in the context of a mobile environment should be done. Three prototypes were developed using evolutionary prototyping which can detect emotions from facial expressions and text data, using state of the art APIs and SDKs where the base of the prototypes was a keyboard known as "Emotional Keyboard" which is compatible with Android devices. Evaluations of Prototype 1 and 2 have been performed based on participatory design and reviewed the compatibility of emotion identification through facial expressions and text data in the mobile context. Evaluation of Prototype 3 should be done in the future and a confusion matrix should be built to verify the accuracies by cross-checking with training and validation accuracies that have been obtained when developing the neural network.},

abstract = {Perinatal stroke (PS) is a serious condition that, if undetected and thus untreated, often leads to life-long disability, in particular Cerebral Palsy (CP). In clinical settings, Prechtl's General Movement Assessment (GMA) can be used to classify infant movements using a Gestalt approach, identifying infants at high risk of developing PS. Training and maintenance of assessment skills are essential and expensive for the correct use of GMA, yet many practitioners lack these skills, preventing larger-scale screening and leading to significant risks of missing opportunities for early detection and intervention for affected infants. We present an automated approach to GMA, based on body-worn accelerometers and a novel sensor data analysis method--Discriminative Pattern Discovery (DPD)--that is designed to cope with scenarios where only coarse annotations of data are available for model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a study with 34 newborns (21 typically developing infants and 13 PS infants with abnormal movements). Our method is able to correctly recognise the trials with abnormal movements with at least the accuracy that is required by newly trained human annotators (75%), which is encouraging towards our ultimate goal of an automated PS screening system that can be used population-wide.},

Our work demonstrates how such a process engages residents in activities to imagine why people might value smart domestic environments and how they might want to interact with them. Through goal setting activities, paper prototyping, and field-testing of resident designed technology probes, we present use cases, design principles and experiential insights. After sharing these findings, we introduce the emergence of smart domestic environments as possessing persuasive, personified and artful qualities.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is cumbersome even for expert clinicians owing to the diversity in the symptoms exhibited by the children which depend on the severity of the disorder. Furthermore, the diagnosis is based on the behavioural observations and the developmental history of the child which has substantial dependence on the perspectives and interpretations of the specialists. In this paper, we present a robot-assisted diagnostic system for the assessment of behavioural symptoms in children for providing a reliable diagnosis. The robotic assistant is intended to support the specialist in administering the diagnostic task, perceiving and evaluating the task outcomes as well as the behavioural cues for assessment of symptoms and diagnosing the state of the child. Despite being used widely in education and intervention for children with autism (CWA), the application of robot assistance in diagnosis is less explored. Further, there have been limited studies addressing the acceptance and effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions for CWA in the Global South. We aim to develop a robot-assisted diagnostic framework for CWA to support the experts and study the viability of such a system in the Indian context.},

Yet from an end-user perspective, we already live in an era of seemingly sentient agents. Virtual personal assistants are now ubiquitous on mobile and smart home devices. But as long as human-level artificial intelligence remains speculative, the ability of today's pseudo-sentient agents to understand and fulfill the full range of human user demands is, by definition, limited and failure-prone. We need better strategies for designing natural, graceful, failure-tolerant user experiences with pseudo-sentient agents. To better support researchers and practitioners actively working on this problem, we propose a Special Interest Group at CHI 2020: a pop-up studio to design the near-future of user interactions with pseudo-sentient agents.},

PbD can be carried out in different ways, for instance, by kinesthetic guidance, teleoperation or by using external controls. In this paper, we compare these three ways of controlling a robot in terms of efficiency, effectiveness (success and error rate) and usability. In an industrial assembly scenario, 51 participants carried out peg-in-hole tasks using one of the three control modalities. The results show that kinesthetic guidance produces the best results. In order to test whether the problems during teleoperation are due to the fact that users cannot, like in kinesthetic guidance, switch between control points using traditional teleoperation devices, we designed a new device that allows users to switch between controls for large and small movements. A user study with 15 participants shows that the novel teleoperation device yields almost as good results as kinesthetic guidance.},

Our RoboTIPS study sets out to design and trial an innovative design feature that will advance the safe operation of social robots and foster societal trust. The Ethical Black Box (EBB) collects data about a robot's actions in real time and in context; when an incident occurs, this data can be used within a wider investigation process to determine what went wrong and prevent similar adverse events. In this paper we draw on Lucy Suchman's groundbreaking work on human-machine relationships to elucidate the goals, practices and potential impact of our study. We align with Suchman's positioning of safety as an accomplishment of situated action and draw on her analysis to describe the actions of the EBB-enhanced social robot as contingent on context and the robot's status as a social agent. We also describe shared priorities in our methodological approaches. We close with observations on how participatory design and an ethnomethodologically-informed stance towards data collection and analysis can contribute to the field of responsible innovation (RI), which seeks to ensure that innovations are undertaken in the public interest and provide societal value.},

In consequences, time taken by developers to code from requirements captured by business analysts is longer than visual representation produced by UX or UI designers, which shortens the requirement gathering process. In conclusion, we found that UX sketching that produces visual representation of user needs to be effective especially in participatory design approach and to reduce user frustrations.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to explore how an intelligent digital companion (agent) can support persons (human) with stress-related exhaustion to manage daily activities. In this paper, we explore in particular how information about a person's emotions can be communicated to the agent with means of non-verbal communication through tangible interfaces. The purpose is to explore how different individuals approach the task of designing their own tangible interfaces for communicating emotions with a digital companion, and the range of different preferences and expectations. Six participants were interviewed and created tangible prototypes during a co-creation workshop. The data was analysed using theories about human emotions and activity, and translated into a generic user model, an architecture for a multiagent system and interface design proposals. The results include increased understanding of how different individuals would like to express their emotions with tangible interfaces, and informed the design of the information models regarding representing emotions. The study illuminated the importance of personalisation of functionality and interface design to address the diversity among individuals, as well as the design of the adaptive behaviour of a digital companion. Future work includes further studies involving additional participants, the development of the stress management application and conducting user studies where prototypes are used in daily activities.},

abstract = {Through an iterative design process using Wizard of Oz (WOz) prototypes, we designed a video calling application for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Our Video Calling for Autism prototype provided an Expressiveness Mirror that gave feedback to autistic people on how their facial expressions might be interpreted by their neurotypical conversation partners. This feedback was in the form of emojis representing six emotions and a bar indicating the amount of overall expressiveness demonstrated by the user. However, when we built a working prototype and conducted a user study with autistic participants, their negative feedback caused us to reconsider how our design process led to a prototype that they did not find useful. We reflect on the design challenges around developing AI technology for an autistic user population, how Wizard of Oz prototypes can be overly optimistic in representing AI-driven prototypes, how autistic research participants can respond differently to user experience prototypes of varying fidelity, and how designing for people with diverse abilities needs to include that population in the development process.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. This skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. For example, Kay et al. showed that although 28% of CEOs in the U.S. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for "CEO" in Google Image Search are women. Similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. Most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. These labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. As observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. We develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. It accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this "diversity score" into the final selection process. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 Google Image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known CelebA dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as "smiling" or "glasses". Both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current Google Image Search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. Further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. These empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.},

How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way? As one answer to this question, we present WeBuildAI, a collective participatory framework that enables people to build algorithmic policy for their communities. The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

Flavor-based cues were then created for each memory through a co-design process. Findings indicate the dominance of relationship themes in the identified self-defining memories and that flavor-based cues related mostly to multiple ingredient dishes. We discuss how these findings can support further research and design into flavor-based memory cues through 3D food printing.},

Present research increasingly uses participatory design methods to tailor dashboards to the needs of stakeholders, employs multimodal data acquisition techniques, and starts to research theoretical underpinnings of dashboards. In this paper, we present these past and present research efforts as well as the results of the VISLA19 workshop on "Visual approaches to Learning Analytics" that was held at LAK19 with experts in the domain to identify and articulate common practices and challenges for the domain.

abstract = {Many researchers have started to explore natural interaction scenarios for children. No matter if these children are normally developing or have special needs, evaluating Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) is a challenge. To find methods that work well and provide reliable data is difficult, for example because commonly used methods such as questionnaires donot work well particularly with younger children. Previous research has shown that children need support in expressing how they feel about technology. Given this, researchers often choose time-consuming behavioral measures from observations to evaluate CRI. However, these are not necessarily comparable between studies and robots.This workshop aims to bring together researchers from differentdisciplines to share their experiences on these aspects. The main topics are methods to evaluate child-robot interaction design, methods to evaluate socially assistive child-robot interaction and multi-modal evaluation of child-robot interaction.Connected questions that we would like to tackle are for example: i) What are reliable metrics in CRI' ii) How can we overcome the pitfalls of survey methods in CRI' iii) How can we integrate qualitative approaches in CRI' iv) What are the best practices for in the wild studies with children? Looking across disciplinary boundaries, we want to discuss advantages and short-comings of using different evaluation methods in order to compile guidelines for future CRI research.

Given that India is a multilingual country (22 official languages), a uniform framework for an integrated text-to-speech synthesis systems with screen readers across six Indian languages are developed, which can be easily extended to other languages as well. Since Indian languages are syllable centred, syllable-based concatenative speech synthesizers are built.This paper describes the development and evaluation of syllable-based Indian language Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system (around festival TTS) with ORCA and NVDA, for Linux and Windows environments respectively. TTS systems for six Indian Languages, namely, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Telugu were built. Usability studies of the screen readers were performed. The system usability was evaluated by a group of visually challenged people based on a questionnaire provided to them. And a Mean Opinion Score(MoS) of 62.27% was achieved.},

abstract = {The development of ontologies is traditionally a process of building vocabularies and understanding complexities of a specific domain to link data and infer knowledge. However, this method does not always include the domain experts throughout the entire development process. This paper presents a Co-design framework as a structured methodology for ontology design and development. The framework, known as the Co-Designing Ontologies Methodology (C-DOM), presents a strategy to draw knowledge from the Subject Matter Expert (SME) without the SME needing to know any-thing about how to create an ontology. The C-DOM framework outlines a series of workshops that align to the layers of the Semantic Technologies architecture and has been developed via an iterative design process and tested in different domains with different levels of complexity and purpose. The first iteration focused on the creation of a light-weight ontology to link generic data in the incident and accident. The next iteration built a heavyweight ontology that included complex inference and reasoning within the urban water management domain. This paper describes the C-DOM in detail for re-use within the Semantic Technologies community and outlines its iterative development process undertake.1},

Substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. We present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. A participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. We then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. We also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.},

abstract = {Several studies have highlighted the absence of an integrated comprehensive dataset covering all of the UK’s museums, hence impeding research into the emergence, evolution, and wider impact of the UK’s museums sector. “Mapping Museums” is an interdisciplinary project aiming to develop a comprehensive database of UK museums in existence since 1960, and to use this to undertake an evidence-based analysis of the development of the UK’s museum sector during 1960--2020 and the links to wider cultural, social, and political concerns. A major part of the project has been the iterative, participatory design of a new RDF/S Knowledge Base to store data and metadata relating to the UK’s museums, and a Web Application for the project’s humanities scholars to browse, search, and visualise the data to investigate their research questions. This article presents the challenges we faced in developing the Knowledge Base and Web Application, our methodology and methods, the design and implementation of the system, and the design, outcomes, and implications of a user trial undertaken with a group of experts from the UK’s museums sector.},

abstract = {The advancement of artificial intelligence and wearable computing triggers the radical innovation of cognitive applications. In this work, we propose VIMES, an augmented reality-based memory assistance system that helps recall declarative memory, such as whom the user meets and what they chat. Through a collaborative method with 20 participants, we design VIMES, a system that runs on smartglasses, takes the first-person audio and video as input, and extracts personal profiles and event information to display on the embedded display or a smartphone. We perform an extensive evaluation with 50 participants to show the effectiveness of VIMES for memory recall. VIMES outperforms (90% memory accuracy) other traditional methods such as self-recall (34%) while offering the best memory experience (Vividness, Coherence, and Visual Perspective all score over 4/5). The user study results show that most participants find VIMES useful (3.75/5) and easy to use (3.46/5).},

abstract = {Menopause is a natural part of women's aging, but is often accompanied by an increased cardiometabolic risk (CMR), of which most women are unaware. Preventive self-care via mobile health applications (apps) is a promising way to address this issue, but research on apps for middle-aged women is limited. Further, modeling such risk is no trivial task in a non-clinical self-care context, where most biomarkers used in traditional models are unavailable. Machine learning (ML) is a potential option in this regard, but many ML approaches are effectively black box models, which leads to doubt regarding their trustworthiness. Therefore, in this paper we analyze and compare different decision tree and rule-based classification models, considered to be inherently interpretable, to assess the CMR of early middle-aged women in the context of a non-clinical self-care app. For this, we first defined a set of candidate determinants based on the feedback of potential users and domain experts. We then used data from a subset of the participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to compare these ML models with traditional risk score models, based on five cardiometabolic 10-year outcomes: heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.},

At the same time, they can be abused to engage in cyberbullying, which can cause significant psychological harm to those affected. Thus, with the growth in multimodal communication platforms, there is an urgent need to devise multimodal methods for cyberbullying detection and prevention. However, there are no existing approaches that use automated audio and video analysis to complement textual analysis. Based on the analysis of a human-labeled cyberbullying data-set of Vine "media sessions' (six-second videos, with audio, and corresponding text comments), we report that: 1) multiple audio and visual features are significantly associated with the occurrence of cyberbullying, and 2) audio and video features complement textual features for more accurate and earlier cyberbullying detection. These results pave the way for more effective cyberbullying detection in emerging multimodal (audio, visual, virtual reality) social interaction spaces.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, civil litigants in the U.S. have come to increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) systems to classify documents for discovery review and fact-finding, an approach now broadly referred to as Technology-Assisted Review (TAR). The transformation of legal discovery from a painstaking manual process to a sophisticated algorithm-driven methodology took place over a relatively short period of time, many years before controversies arose surrounding the use of automated risk assessment tools on the criminal side of the U.S. justice system. Introduced in 2008 to a handful of litigators in an experimental research setting hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), TAR was first deployed live on an active litigation in 2012, and by 2015 a vocal and influential vanguard of judges was actively advocating for its use on cases involving large, complex document discovery. My research examines the cross-disciplinary experimentation and collaboration that took place across legal practitioners and computer scientists leading to ML becoming a judicially accepted solution in U.S. civil litigation practice. The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive case study for how an expert professional field wrestled with the challenges of integrating ML into sensitive decision-making workflows. While deeply attentive to the unique and complex encounter between U.S. civil litigation practice and computer science, my work also aims to inform the practice of algorithmic system design, development, and governance across other high-stakes professional domains.},

abstract = {The field of Predictive Analytics (PA) provides the possibility to utilize large amounts of data to improve forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and competitive advantage. Especially the transport logistics sector, which is characterized by high business-related uncertainties, time-sensitivity, and volatility, highly benefits from accurate resource and production planning. While success factors and framework conditions of applying PA are well-investigated on a theoretical SCM level, findings on internal and external challenges of transport logistics organizations remain scarce. Therefore, based on a multiple case approach, this study offers in-depth insights into six real-world cases of freight forwarders, ocean carriers, and air carriers. The results uncover both internal and external challenges. From the internal perspective, the biggest challenges are related to the technical implementation including the acquisition of globally generated, internal and external data and its harmonization. In addition, stakeholder management and target setting impede the development of PA. Regarding external challenges, relational and external conditions hamper the application. Therefore, especially actions of third-party institutions in terms of standardization and security enhancements are required. This study contributes to the existing literature in various ways as the systematic identification addresses real-world issues of PA in the neglected but crucial area of transport logistics, discussing urgent research needs and highlighting potential solutions. Additionally, the results offer valuable guidance for managers when implementing PA in transport logistics.},

We investigate this question in the context of video games with non-player characters (NPCs), because the rapid expansion of the game industry makes NPCs one of the most common ways in which we experience AI agents. We seek to understand whether players benefit mentally by giving gifts to NPCs in video games. We intend to observe the behaviour of players and measure their psychological changes through a specially designed video game providing them with mechanisms for gifting to NPCs. We have taken an understanding of gifting from the real world and applied this understanding within a game. The game development has been an iterative process of design-build-playtest. Such a process helps us better understand the research space and to better describe the questions.

abstract = {Patient safety errors account for over 400,000 preventable deaths annually in US in hospitals alone, 70% of which are caused by team communication breakdowns, stemming from hierarchical structures and asymmetrical power dynamics between physicians, nurses, patients, and others. Nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and prevent these errors, but they are often penalized for speaking up, particularly when physicians are responsible. Nevertheless, empowering nurses and building strong interdisciplinary teams can lead to improved patient safety and outcomes. Thus, our group has been developing a series of intelligent systems that support teaming in safety critical settings, Robot-Centric Team Support System (RoboTSS), and recently developed a group detection and tracking system for collaborative robots. In this paper, we explore how RoboTSS can be used to empower nurses in interprofessional team settings, through a three month long, collaborative design process with nurses across five US-based hospitals. The main findings and contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we found that participants envisioned using a robotic crash cart to guide resuscitation procedures to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Second, nurses discussed how RoboTSS can generate choreography for efficient spatial reconfigurations in co-located clinical teams, which is particularly important in time-sensitive situations such as resuscitation. Third, we found that nurses want to use RoboTSS to "stop the line," and disrupt power dynamics by policing unsafe physician behavior, such as avoiding safety protocols using a robotic crash cart. Fourth, nurses envisioned using our system to support real-time error identification, such as breaking the sterile field, and then communicating those errors to physicians, to relieve them of responsibility. Finally, based on our findings, we propose robot design implications that capture how nurses envision utilizing RoboTSS. We hope this work promotes further exploration in how to design technology to challenge authority in asymmetrical power relationships, particularly in healthcare, as strong teams save lives.},

My preliminary results demonstrate the versatility of the approach; for ex- ample, the system can recognize return statements, method signatures, tool tips, and dialog boxes.},

abstract = {The application of object detection is becoming more and more widely in various fields, including the power industry, of course. And YOLOv3 is one of the most popular algorithms in the field of object detection owing to its high performance and efficiency. However, the conventional YOLOv3 algorithm is still too heavy to deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. Consequently, this paper proposes a method to improve the YOLOv3 thus it can be easily deployed to embedded platforms without losing performance. First, substitutes the backbone of YOLOv3, i.e. Darknet53 for MobileNet, which has been proven to be a very efficiency framework for lightweight network. Second, there are numerous redundancies in the detection heads of YOLOv3 and will take a lot of time in the inference process, so we prune the detection heads to a dead-simple structure. Various experiments on our own Power Transmission Line datasets verify our method has state-of-the-art performance while can meet the requirements for deployment to the mobile platforms.},

We take these sketches and analyze them using image boards, which are a collage of pictures used to communicate a description of design aesthetics and intent. We used this technique to derive patterns and conclusions from the large set of sketches, which can inform the design of future cyborg applications. The sketches reveal that wearable arms are useful for reducing physical strain and multi-tasking, but should incorporate a ''rest'' mode in full-time applications.},

abstract = {In a collaborative design environment, various software tools are utilized to enhance the product development. This entails a meaningful representation and exchange of product data semantics across these different systems. Semantic interoperability of product information refers to enabling the exchange of design intelligence, including construction history, parameters, features, and constraints. This is a crucial difference compared to current standards such as STEP that deliver "dumb" geometry, where no design intent is associated. To enable semantics data exchange, we propose an ontology-based approach, consisting in developing a "Common Design Features Ontology", called CDFO. Interoperability among ontologies is fulfilled by defining several mapping rules. We use a descriptive logic-based language, notably OWL DL to represent formally our ontology.},

abstract = {As tools for design get increasingly complex and powerful, it is increasingly important that their users have a solid grounding in what it is these tools do and how they do it. When these tools are software engineering tools, we can assume that their users have formal training in computing. However, when the tools are for designing art or multimedia objects, the artists using the tools typically don't have much background in the computing technology they are using. While interdisciplinary design teams can work around the shortcomings of individual team members, they might be more effective teams if they shared a common language and understanding of certain key aspects of the design process. At the University of Washington we have begun a project to study the use of the theory of problem solving as shared knowledge by design teams engaged in creating of multimedia games. The theory we used is derived from early work in artificial intelligence. The concepts of state space, search, operators and evaluation functions are key components of the shared knowledge. The theory is embodied in a software system called T-STAR (Transparent STate-spaces search ARchitecture) which supports a collaborative interface for problem-solving. A key question for the project is "to what extent will interdisciplinary design teams adopt and exploit the theory of problem solving when given an opportunity to do so?"},

abstract = {It has been argued that people are more inclined to accept a robot in their daily lives and even their home, if they have the feeling that the robot's behavior and interaction style matches their characteristics, needs and abilities. The concept of personalization has been introduced in order to create such personal, tailored human-robot interactions (HRI). Personalizing HRI means that robot takes into account individual user characteristics and can adjust its behavior to the situation and the human interaction partner. Previous HRI research indicates that personalization can have positive effects on the user experience during HRI as well as the user's attitudes towards and perceptions of the robot. This workshop is aimed at discussing the value of and exchanging ideas about the concept of personalization for HRI design. More concretely, we want to explore tools, methods and processes for appropriate robot behavior design and interaction modelling for personalized HRI. The workshop uses interactive, creative activities inspired by design thinking and participatory design to promote collaboration and co-creation between the participants and to inspire new, innovative perspectives on personalized HRI.},

In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users' preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants, 3,625 referents, and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.

To do so, we analyze the need for four vision skills--object recognition, text recognition, color recognition, and counting--on over 27,000 visual questions from two datasets representing both scenarios. We next quantify the difficulty of these skills for both humans and computers on both datasets. Finally, we propose a novel task of predicting what vision skills are needed to answer a question about an image. Our results reveal (mis)matches between aims of real users of such services and the focus of the AI community. We conclude with a discussion about future directions for addressing the visual question answering task.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {This paper presents a gesture set for communicating states to novice users from a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) through an elicitation study comparing gestures created by participants recruited from the general public with varying levels of experience with an sUAS. Previous work in sUAS flight paths sought to communicate intent, destination, or emotion without focusing on concrete states such as Low Battery or Landing. This elicitation study uses a participatory design approach from human-computer interaction to understand how novice users would expect an sUAS to communicate states, and ultimately suggests flight paths and characteristics to indicate those states. We asked users from the general public (N=20) to create gestures for seven distinct sUAS states to provide insights for human-drone interactions and to present intuitive flight paths and characteristics with the expectation that the sUAS would have general commercial application for inexperienced users. The results indicate relatively strong agreement scores for three sUAS states: Landing (0.455), Area of Interest (0.265), and Low Battery (0.245). The other four states have lower agreement scores, however even they show some consensus for all seven states. The agreement scores and the associated gestures suggest guidance for engineers to develop a common set of flight paths and characteristics for an sUAS to communicate states to novice users.},

abstract = {Geometrical thinking is a life-long skill, yet, despite its importance, geometry teaching and learning is fraught with difficulties. Traditional pen and pencil approaches have failed to address them. In this vein, a conceptual instructional design (ID), namely GeoArt-ID, is proposed as a radically novel, holistic approach to develop geometrical thinking using art as a source for inspiring activity content for learning geometry. The dynamic design of GeoArt-ID is based upon a framework where the synergy of multiple knowledge, i.e., Technological, Didactical, Content (TDCK) knowledge is involved. GeoArt-ID is set within an affective (a-), blended (b-) and collaborative (c-) learning environment, introducing unique quantitative metrics to express the evolution of the learner's geometrical thinking. oese metrics could be derived from the analysis of a collection of a large amount of sensorial biosignals (big data) captured via unobtrusive smart sensors during sensorimotor learning activities. Data-to-knowledge representation, considering the domains of emotion, cognitive, body gesture and geometric tasks, could be achieved via advanced signal processing and machine/deep learning. Consequently, GeoArt-ID can exhibit high adaptability, scaffolding mentally disabled students to perform geometrical thinking and reasoning for all.},

We explore the potential contribution of multiagent systems technologies to the solution of these problems by exposing the close relationship between social computation and existing methods in multiagent systems. We describe how these methods could be reused in this novel application context, what methodological implications this has, and argue that the resulting cross-fertilisation will be highly beneficial for both sides.},

Designs annotating and describing emotions are categorised as anthropomorphic, abstract, object based, or biomorphic. The paper concludes that teenagers use a variety of visual metaphors to describe emotions, that teenagers use anthropomorphic visual metaphors the most to describe emotions and that teenagers make more use of abstract and biomorphic visual metaphors to describe 'negative' emotions. The effect of materials on designs is analysed, suggesting that teenagers are more likely to create designs describing emotions featuring anthropomorphic visual metaphors when using malleable three-dimensional materials. Suggestions are made for the use of externalisation and personification as part of interactive emotion displays within affective systems. This research will be of value to interaction designers and Child Computer Interaction researchers seeking to understand how teenagers use different visual metaphors to describe different emotions. The contribution of this work is a categorisation of the visual metaphors teenagers use to express different emotions.},

This paper reports initial findings of the application of software agents in support of an interactive, user-centered conceptual software design scenario. The supporting role of a number of single responsibility agents is described and results for a case study indicate that the application of such agents to search-based design scenarios provides efficient, high performance and effective support. The notion of interactive, joint human-computer activity appears to map well to conceptual software design scenarios: focus on superior design concepts and thence to useful and interesting designs provides a natural and effective way of narrowing the population based search. In addition, agents and the human designer appear to interact as cooperative "team players", jointly influencing the evolutionary algorithm based search. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including expanding the scale of implementation of underlying technologies to support distributed, collaborative design.},

abstract = {We introduce ARMath, a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) system that allows ch ildren to discover mathematical concepts in familiar, ord inary objects and engage with math problems in meaningful contexts. Leveraging advanced computer vision, ARMath recognizes everyday objects, visualizes their mathematical attributes, and turns them into tangible or virtual manipulatives. Using the manipulatives, children can solve problems that situate math operations or concepts in specific everyday contexts. Informed by four participatory design sessions with teachers and children, we developed five ARMath modules to support basic arithmetic and 2D geometry. We also conducted an exploratory evaluation of ARMath with 27 children (ages 5-8) at a local children's museum. Our findings demonstrate how ARMath engages children in math learning, how failures in AI can be used as learning opportunities, and challenges that children face when using ARMath.},

abstract = {Designers create inspirational mood boards to express their design ideas visually, through collages of images and text. They find appropriate images and reflect on them as they explore emergent design concepts. After presenting the results of a participatory design workshop and a survey of professional designers, we introduce SemanticCollage, a digital mood board tool that attaches semantic labels to images by applying a state-of-the-art semantic labeling algorithm. SemanticCollage helps designers to 1) translate vague, visual ideas into search terms; 2) make better sense of and communicate their designs; while 3) not disrupting their creative flow. A structured observation with 12 professional designers demonstrated how semantic labels help designers successfully guide image search and find relevant words that articulate their abstract, visual ideas. We conclude by discussing how SemanticCollage inspires new uses of semantic labels for supporting creative practice.},

abstract = {Autonomous virtual agents (VAs) are increasingly used commercially in critical information spaces such as healthcare. Existing VA research has focused on microscale interaction patterns such as usability and artificial intelligence. However, the macroscale patterns of users' information practices and their relationship with the design and adoption of VAs have been largely understudied, especially when it comes to older adults (OAs), who stand to benefit greatly from VAs. We conducted a preliminary investigation to understand the role design elements, such as anthropomorphic aspects of VAs, play in OAs' perception of VAs and in OAs' preferences for VAs' participation within their health information practices. Some unexpected findings indicate that the fidelity of anthropomorphic features influences perception in ways that are dependent on the context of the information tasks. This suggests that research on improving the design and increasing the adoption of VAs should factor the interplay between fidelity of VA representation and information context.},

However, the IoT revolution comes along with other so-called disruptive technologies. Making sense of the data gathered through sensors comes along with discussions of AI, Big Data, Machine Learning and other such technological advancements. While a number of projects already address current challenges of exploiting such technological advancements in digital government, the full scope of deploying the disruptive technologies in smart city initiatives requires more research. This paper therefore aims at investigating research needs in successfully implementing and deploying disruptive technologies in smart cities. The paper first analyses existing EU-funded projects concerning the research needs these projects address and/or put forward. Subsequently, a future scenario is developed to demonstrate the potentials of using disruptive technologies in smart cities. Finally, nine research needs (technical and nontechnical) derived from the comparison of existing research needs from the projects and from the future scenario.},

We describe the iterative design process used to create the Framework, as well as three novel prototypes designed to increase social connectedness and social presence in high-latency situations: 1) the InSync app that allows partners to perform activities simultaneously even though they only see proof of their synchronicity later; 2) the After the Beep system that lets users leave IoT messages that are triggered by the recipients; and 3) the Surrogate platform where players play group battle games against "surrogate" artificial intelligence avatars that mimic unavailable individuals. Data from two design workshops validates the usefulness of the framework for generating new solutions to high-latency scenarios.},

abstract = {When a new product is delivered, it seldom meets all customer needs. The mature phase of a product is driven by customer needs. It requires a human-centered development cycle. As a result, the company should be able to listen the voice of its customers. Most industrial companies are driven by engineers and by technology itself. If current technology is to serve all actors of the life cycle of a product, related companies need to change their ways of dealing with maturity. They have to stop being so driven by features and start examining what customers actually do. The concept of customer itself has to be revisited to the point that any person or group who deals with a product (coming from a process) is a customer of those who developed the product. Product maturity and process maturity are usually distinguished. Product maturity is related to end-user satisfaction, i.e., customers. Product maturity deals with user experience. Process maturity is related to designers, developers, maintainers and other actors who have an impact on the making and evolution of the product. Process maturity deals with organizations, communities and teams involved in the production of a product. This paper proposes an integrated approach to product and process maturity that involves the use of active design documents to support the description of what the product is, how it is or should be used, why it is designed the way it is and how much it will cost to customers in terms of performance, safety, comfort and other criteria that may be relevant to the product purpose of use.},

However, the information-seeking process can be exhausting, cumbersome and even confusing for migrants as they must cope with time-consuming information overload while searching desired information from lists of documents. Chatbots are easy-to-use, natural, and intuitive, and thus could support information-seeking. There is a lack of research that engages and empowers migrants and other stakeholders as co-design participants in chatbot development. We explored how migrants can be empowered in designing a chatbot that supports their social integration. Using a co-design approach, we conducted a series of activities with migrants and other stakeholders (i.e., online questionnaires, empathy probes, surveys, and co-design workshops) to first understand their expectations regarding chatbots, and then co-design a personality-driven chatbot. We found that chatbot personality can drive co-designing a chatbot as design goals, design directions, and design criteria.},

We propose boundary conditions to denote such conditions. We explore this issue through interviews with eight participants in a large ongoing health IT project. The aim of the project is to implement a shared electronic health record system for health care services in a region of Norway. Four phenomena are discussed—group discontinuity, informal follow-up meetings, contractual discussions in the participatory activity, and the “parking” of design decisions. For each phenomenon, we reflect on the associated boundary conditions and their effects on participation and user impact. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made to help participatory design scale with the complexities of large-scale projects: (1) make the boundary conditions explicit; (2) plan for reflections on the process; and (3) plan for peer interaction between users.},

The system automatically extracts events from the raw text, formalized as a sequence of temporally ordered predicate-arguments.

The results of the machine-learner and the extracted events are then used to generate fine-grained advice for the students.},

abstract = {Impact assessments have received particular attention on both sides of the Atlantic as a tool for implementing algorithmic accountability. The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability---individual rights and systemic governance--- and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.},

This work focuses on the definition of a co-design methodology to integrate a crowdsourcing solution in the DRR processes. We define the proposed methodology, and implement it involving operators and experts in the DRR domain (crisis managers, technical services, first responders). We show how a participatory design approach helps in the design of a crowdsourcing solution that experts are willing to integrate into their DRR procedures.},

abstract = {Motivation -- With collaborative interaction design, formal models have to be used by expert stakeholders in order to work effectively and efficiently. But these formal models should not be discussed with non-expert stakeholders. Therefore, we use non-formal methods which are based on our formal models when we talk to non-expert stakeholders.Research approach --Expert stakeholders have to get a common ground for their discussions. To achieve that common ground, expert stakeholders have to use models, which formalize an interaction they want to design. We develop non-formal methods based on a conceptual model that are easy to apply by non-experts. This way, non-expert stakeholders can allow free play to their thoughts and do not have to adopt formal entities and models. Therefore, the expert can easily interpret the information received from non-expert stakeholders by using the underlying conceptual model.Findings/Design -- Early collaboration with non-expert stakeholders in order to design interaction in a user centered way is important and performed best with a formal model for expert stakeholders and non-formal methods based on these formal models for discussions between expert and non-expert stakeholders.Actually, formal modelling is crucial from our point of view, but we experienced that insisting on it when collaborating with non-experts, leads to insufficient results.Take away message -- Without having formal models in mind, non-formal methods cannot be applied effectively for a collaborative design of interactions. Non-formal methods like an open requirements elicitation in form of workshops or interviews may fail gaining all necessary information if there is no formal model which builds the basis for the non-formal methods. Only with formal models, we are able to plan, lead, and analyze non-formal methods in a way to get optimal results.},

However, the ability to actively participate in creative activities involving music performance has so far been difficult for users with complex disabilities.This paper discusses placing a technology probe, using gesture based musical controls, in an existing music technology project for users with complex disabilities (conditions which affect both cognitive and motor abilities of an individual). The focus is on understanding the needs of this user group in a participatory design approach for creative music technologies that allow for tailored accessibility.Outcomes from this research show that many multi-level social interactions surrounding the technology, users, audience, and any third party facilitators exist in the context of 'facilitated performance'. Results suggest that including facilitators in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) could allow for improved accessibility for users with complex disabilities.},

abstract = {Computer games are a rich subject for computer science instruction. Unlike many traditional topics in computer science, gaming is inherently interdisciplinary. Developing games requires integration of concepts from computer graphics, artificial intelligence, operating systems, physical simulation, and, for multi-player games, networking and distributed systems. Consequently, a course in computer games offers an opportunity to survey a broad number of subjects in Computer Science while still maintaining a coherent focus on a single subject. In addition to this unique perspective on Computer Science, computer game development is also a topic of great interest to students. In the following I describe a curriculum for a course which surveys Computer Science through the perspective of computer games. This course has been successfully used for two different courses at different institutions. Over the course of this curriculum, students construct a fully functional game. As topics in computer science are covered, functionality related to those topics is implemented in the game. This incremental development provides students with an integrated view of what are traditionally disparate topics in Computer Science.},

In this paper we describe a traceability framework which consists of a TRAceability Metamodel (TRAM) and a TRAceability Process (TRAP). TRAM provides a language for describing the elements of a traceability process. The TRAceability Process (TRAP) is a process authoring tool for publishing product lifecycle process configurations as a web site for practitioners to access. A key component of the traceability process is the introduction of traceability patterns which provide a standardized mechanism for the visualization and communication of reusable traceability practices.A tool environment supporting the traceability framework is described. The TRAceability Pattern Environment (TRAPEd) is an environment for the structured and collaborative design of a traceability metamodel, process and patterns. Finally we represent the traceability metamodel, process and patterns using Topic Maps (ISO 13250)},

IUI is a user interface that uses intelligent technology to reach the communication between humans and machines. The construction of IUI is not easy and requires the knowledge of different methods, techniques and technologies from many domains (such as, HCI, artificial intelligence, ergonomics, software engineering, etc.). In this way, the existence of a process is an important tool for IUI developers. The literature presents design processes and frameworks for user interface, but most of them do not offer any knowledge regarding the methods, techniques, and technologies that can be used to support the activities involved. Thus, this work proposes a development process for IUIs which offers recommendations about methods, techniques, and technologies. We hope that this process will help analysts and designers who work in IUI area.},

abstract = {Love them or hate them, videos are a pervasive format for delivering online education at scale. They are especially popular for computer programming tutorials since videos convey expert narration alongside the dynamic effects of editing and running code. However, these screencast videos simply consist of raw pixels, so there is no way to interact with the code embedded inside of them. To expand the design space of learner interactions with programming videos, we developed Codemotion, a computer vision algorithm that automatically extracts source code and dynamic edits from existing videos. Codemotion segments a video into regions that likely contain code, performs OCR on those segments, recognizes source code, and merges together related code edits into contiguous intervals. We used Codemotion to build a novel video player and then elicited interaction design ideas from potential users by running an elicitation study with 10 students followed by four participatory design workshops with 12 additional students. Participants collectively generated ideas for 28 kinds of interactions such as inline code editing, code-based skimming, pop-up video search, and in-video coding exercises.},

The diagnosis relies on the observation of behavioural symptoms and parent reporting of the developmental history of the child. It requires years of experience and training for identifying these symptoms which could be often misjudged as other mental conditions with similar symptomology. In this work, we propose a robot-assisted diagnostic protocol for the early detection of autism leveraging the onboard sensors of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) and the vast potential of machine learning techniques. The robot assistant's role will be two-fold: (a) supporting the expert in administering the diagnostic procedure and (b) evaluating the behavioural symptoms and reaching a reliable diagnosis. Even though similar studies have been done in the Global North, the challenges posed by the social and cultural diversity of the Indian population is varied and needs to be explored further.},

To complement our system, we plan to give the students' community the possibility to contribute to the whole system, not only with ideas (e.g., participatory design and user-driven innovation) and data (e.g., crowdsourcing and crowdsensing) but also with sensors to plug-in into the infrastructure and visualization add-ons to represent the gathered data.},

Whereas Wikipedia currently uses only manual flagging to detect possible bias, our scheme provides a foundation for the automating of bias flagging by improving upon the methodology of annotation schemes in classic sentiment analysis. We also address challenges unique to the task of identifying biased writing within the specific context of Wikipedia's neutrality policy. We perform a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement, which shows that although the agreement scores for intra-sentential tags were relatively low, the agreement scores on the sentence and entry levels were encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively). Based on an analysis of our first implementation of our scheme, we suggest possible improvements to our guidelines, in hope that further rounds of annotation after incorporating them could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of bias within Wikipedia.},

In earlier work, agents need to follow an order of the depth-first traversal of the hypertree to update their belief. Hence, agents need some synchronization with each other and belief updating can only be done in a limited parallel. Especially, belief updating will fail if any communication channels have problems. In this paper, we present an iterative method where multiple agents asynchronously perform belief updating in a complete parallel. Compared to the previous work, the iterative method is simple, self-adaptive and robust.},

abstract = {The use of data is essential for the capabilities of Data-driven Artificial intelligence (AI), Deep Learning and Big Data analysis techniques. This data usage, however, raises intrinsically the concerns on data privacy. In addition, supporting collaborative development of AI applications across organisations has become a major need in AI system design. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is required to protect intellectual property in such collaboration. As a consequence of DRM, privacy threats and privacy-enforcing mechanisms will interact with each other.This paper describes the privacy and DRM requirements in collaborative AI system design using AI pipelines. It describes the relationships between DRM and privacy and outlines the threats against these non-functional features. Finally, the paper provides first security architecture to protect against the threats on DRM and privacy in collaborative AI design using AI pipelines.},

abstract = {The State Grid Corporation proposed the "Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things" in early 2019, requiring the deep integration of the Internet of Things technology and the smart grid, and fully applying advanced information technologies such as artificial intelligence and mobile internet to realize the comprehensive perception and extensive interconnection of massive data in the power system. Standardization research on 3D (three-dimensional) model of power transmission and transformation project was carried out, which is conducive to promoting the sharing of massive engineering information and fully exploiting the value of engineering data. In order to achieve reduction of the model volume, advanced modeling methods need to be studied. Therefore, the 3D spatial modeling method was studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of different 3D modeling methods were compared and analyzed. The CSG modeling technology was used based on the actual situation. The power transmission and transformation engineering design model based on CSG modeling technology were build. Combined with the characteristics of substation model, a 3D modeling method for substation was given.},

abstract = {The shift to digital educational resources provides new opportunities to advance psychology and education research, in tandem with improving instruction using theory and data. To realize this potential, this paper explores how randomized experiments can support mutually beneficial instructor-researcher collaborations. We developed the Collaborative Dynamic Experimentation (CDE) framework to address two key tensions. To enable researchers to embed experiments in online lessons while maintaining instructors' editorial control, Collaborative experiment authoring is needed. To enable instructors to use data for rapid improvement while maintaining statistically valid data for researchers, we apply an interpretable machine learning algorithm for Dynamic experimentation. We worked with an on-campus instructor to implement a proof-of-concept CDE system to experiment within their online calculus quizzes. The qualitative results from this deployment provided insight into how the CDE framework can facilitate alignment of research and practice.},

It draws on sociological accounts of representation and translation to examine one particular case: the application of topic modeling to blogs written by parents of children on the autism spectrum. In doing so, the paper illustrates the kinds of statements that topic models, and other computational techniques, can make on behalf of people. It also articulates some of the potential consequences of such statements. The paper concludes by offering several suggestions about how to address potential harms that can occur when computational models speak on behalf of someone.},

Concurrently, people are confronted with a reduced sense of autonomy as a result of being monitored and guided in their actions by complex and autonomous technologies they do not fully understand or control. HCI researchers are investigating how to design intelligible and human-centered autonomous systems to increase trust and address various ethical and societal challenges. In this workshop, we want to deepen and expand the discussion on tensions between human and machine autonomy when designing AI systems, focusing on scientific, technological and ethical challenges that it poses. We will adopt a pragmatic and multidisciplinary approach to look into how human-centered approaches could enhance human autonomy/agency when interacting with intelligent autonomous systems.},

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

This paper probes this creative process by studying how dancers interact with technology to generate ideas. We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.},

abstract = {Distributed Virtual Environments (DVEs), such as online games, military simulations, collaborative design, etc., are very popular nowadays. To support large-scale DVEs, a multi-server architecture is usually employed, and the virtual world is partitioned into multiple zones for load distribution. The client assignment problem arises when assigning the participating clients to the servers. Current approaches usually assign clients to servers according to the locations of clients in the virtual world, i.e., clients interacting in the same zone of the virtual world will be assigned to the same server. This approach may degrade the interactivity of DVEs if the network delay from a client to its assigned server is large. In this paper, we formulate the client assignment problem, and propose two algorithms to assign clients to servers in a more efficient way. The proposed algorithms are based on the heuristics developed for the well-known Terminal Assignment problem. Simulation results with the BRITE Internet Topology Generator show that our algorithms are effective in enhancing the interactivity of DVEs.},

abstract = {Drawing curves in mid-air with fingers is a fundamental task with applications to 3D sketching, geometric modeling, handwriting recognition, and authentication. Mid-air curve input is most commonly accomplished through explicit user input; akin to click-and-drag, the user may use a hand posture (e.g. pinch) or a button-press on an instrumented controller to express the intention to start and stop sketching. In this paper, we present a novel approach to recognize the user's intention to draw or not to draw in a mid-air sketching task without the use of postures or controllers. For every new point recorded in the user's finger trajectory, the idea is to simply classify this point as either hover or stroke. Our work is motivated by a behavioral study that demonstrates the need for such an approach due to the lack of robustness and intuitiveness while using hand postures and instrumented devices. We captured sketch data from users using a haptics device and trained multiple binary classifiers using feature vectors based on the local geometric and motion profile of the trajectory. We present a systematic comparison of these classifiers and discuss the advantages of our approach to spatial curve input applications.},

abstract = {Despite a lack of consensus on the nature of Computing Research Methods (CRM), a growing number of programs are exploring models and content for CRM courses. This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

abstract = {In meeting health, education, and lifestyle goals, technology can both assist individuals with autism, and support those who live and work with them, such as family, caregivers, coworkers, and friends. The uniqueness of each individual with autism and the context of their lives provide interesting design challenges for the successful creation and adoption of technologies for this domain. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to bring together those who study the use of technology by and for individuals with autism, those who design and de-velop new technologies, and those who are curious about getting involved. Areas that this SIG will consider include assistive technologies; tools for data collection and analysis; educational software; virtual reality rehabilitation environments; identifying users; need finding; user-centered collaborative design processes that include individuals who cannot speak or write; and product assessment. This SIG will provide opportunities for participants to join together and share their own pro-jects, design challenges, and lessons learned while fo-cusing on directions for future development. Those with experience and newcomers to the field are both equally encouraged to attend.},

abstract = {Everyday life is increasingly mediated by technology. Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity, especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology, an important, emerging concern is how the self-the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency-plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question, we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of "care of the self," which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design.},

abstract = {Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are increasingly popular, particularly in homes. However, little research has investigated their potential in other settings, such as schools. We investigated how VUIs could support inclusive education, particularly for pupils with visual impairments (VIs). We organised focused discussions with educators at a school, with support staff from local authorities and, through bodystorming, with a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools, and opened a space for educators, sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios, a design space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this space.},

abstract = {Consider a movie studio aiming to produce a set of new movies for summer release: What types of movies it should produce? Who would the movies appeal to? How many movies should it make? Similar issues are encountered by a variety of organizations, e.g., mobile-phone manufacturers and online magazines, who have to create new (non-existent) items to satisfy groups of users with different preferences. In this paper, we present a joint problem formalization of these interrelated issues, and propose generative methods that address these questions simultaneously. Specifically, we leverage on the latent space obtained by training a deep generative model---the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)---via a loss function that incorporates both rating performance and item reconstruction terms. We use a greedy search algorithm that utilize this learned latent space to jointly obtain K plausible new items, and user groups that would find the items appealing. An evaluation of our methods on a synthetic dataset indicates that our approach is able to generate novel items similar to highly-desirable unobserved items. As case studies on real-world data, we applied our method on the MART abstract art and Movielens Tag Genome datasets, which resulted in promising results: small and diverse sets of novel items.},

abstract = {For more than two decades software agent technology represents one of rapidly developing areas of research. The main achievement of this trend of research was the development of new programming models that address both the basic features of agenthood (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and social abilities) as well as more advanced, human-like features usually collectively coined in the agent literature as "mental attitudes" (beliefs, desires, intentions, commitments). Agent oriented technologies, engineering of agent systems, agent languages, development tools, and methodologies are an active and emergent research area. The recent challenge is to include agents in real software environments and widely use the agent paradigm in mainstream programming. In this paper we are going to give an overview of the rapidly developing area of software agents including: overview of the agent programming languages, tools and platforms; possible applications of intelligent and mobile software agents; agents in "Smart Environments".},

abstract = {The main purpose of assistive technology is to support an individual's daily activities, in order to increase ability, autonomy, relatedness and quality of life. The aim for the work presented in this article is to develop automated methods to tailor the behavior of the assistive technology for the purpose to provide just-in-time, adaptive interventions targeting multiple domains. This requires methods for representing and updating the user model, including goals, preferences, abilities, activity and its situation. We focus the assessment and intervention tasks typically performed by therapists and provide knowledge-based technology for supporting the process. A formative evaluation study was conducted as a part of a participatory action research process, involving two rehabilitation experts, two young individuals and one senior individual as end-user participants, in addition to knowledge engineers. The main contribution of this work is a theory-based method for assessing the individual's goals, preferences, abilities and motives, which is used for building a holistic user model. The user model is continuously updated and functions as the base for tailoring the system's assistive behavior during intervention and follow-up.},

Special care was brought to make the simulations playable by humans and to favor the apparition of coalitions. Being controlled by humans, the agents of the initial model became completely pro-active and were able to exchange coffee and money and to form coalitions to fulfill the buyer's offers. Coalitions appeared as expected.Besides, during these experiments, we observed the emergence of specialized roles which were not included in the initial model. We implemented a regular multi-agent system based on the initial model to test the distributed system solving improvements brought by the roles that emerged.},

abstract = {A method of organizing the crowd to generate ideas is described. It integrates crowds using evolutionary algorithms. The method increases the creativity of ideas across generations, and it works better than greenfield idea generation. Specifically, a design space of internet-scale idea generation systems is defined, and one instance is tested: a crowd idea generation system that uses combination to improve previous designs. The key process of the system is the following: A crowd generates designs, then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs were compared to the initial designs and to the designs produced by a greenfield idea generation system. The results show that the sequential combination system produced more creative ideas in the last generation and outperformed the greenfield idea generation system. The design space of crowdsourced idea generation developed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied to a wide range of design problems. The work has both pragmatic and theoretical implications: New forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to test existing and emerging theories of coordination and participatory design. Moreover, it may be possible for human designers, organized as a crowd, to codesign with each other and with automated algorithms.},

How might designers support such human values? We interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 OECD countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.},

abstract = {A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs. This user centered approach has proved fruitful, but there exists relatively little work examining the intent and values of the roboticists themselves. Furthermore, we know little of how the values of roboticists influence their own designs. Such knowledge could help designers better reflect on whether their designs effectively convey particular ethics to their users. In this study, we analyzed 27 interviews of pioneer humanoid roboticists, seeking to identify the values of such roboticists. Our results suggest that roboticists' values are shaped by a dominant engineering-based background that emphasizes robotics as a field of integration (especially humanoids). Roboticists also see robots as testbeds for learning about humans themselves. We advocate a VSD approach for humanoids that goes beyond engineering disciplines and forces values to the forefront of discussion.},

abstract = {Research to date aimed at the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems has largely focused on topics such as identifying failures of current systems and on technical interventions intended to reduce bias in computational processes. Researchers have given less attention to methods that account for the social and political contexts of specific, situated technical systems at their points of use. Co-developing algorithmic accountability interventions in communities supports outcomes that are more likely to address problems in their situated context and re-center power with those most disparately affected by the harms of algorithmic systems. In this paper we report on our experiences using participatory and co-design methods for algorithmic accountability in a project called the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit. The main insights we gleaned from our experiences were: (i) many meaningful interventions toward equitable algorithmic systems are non-technical; (ii) community organizations derive the most value from localized materials as opposed to what is "scalable" beyond a particular policy context; (iii) framing harms around algorithmic bias suggests that more accurate data is the solution, at the risk of missing deeper questions about whether some technologies should be used at all. More broadly, we found that community-based methods are important inroads to addressing algorithmic harms in their situated contexts.},

abstract = {The expansion of charging infrastructure and the optimal utilization of existing infrastructure are key influencing factors for the future growth of electric mobility. The main objective of this paper is to present a novel methodology which identifies the necessary stakeholders, processes their contextual information and meets their optimality criteria using a constraint satisfaction strategy. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used for optimally distributing the electric vehicle charging resources in a smart-mobility ecosystem. The algorithm performs context-aware, constrained-optimization such that the on-demand requests of each stakeholder, e.g., vehicle owner as end-user, grid-operator, fleet-operator, charging-station service operator, is fulfilled. In the proposed methodology, the system learns from the surrounding environment until the optimal charging resource allocation strategy within the limitations of the system constraints is reached. We look at the concept of optimality from the perspective of multiple stakeholders who participate in the smart-mobility ecosystem. A simple use case is presented in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential to develop this concept further to enable more complex digital interactions between the actors of a smart-mobility eco-system.},

Our research group at Fraunhofer FIT looks back on a 51 year long research tradition that started with Engelbart’s vision and followed through the larger developments of HCI from the introduction of CSCW up to successful projects involving the engineering of large software systems in practice. In this paper, we outline the history of our institute against the background of trends in HCI, working out the cornerstones and “useful practices” from our research tradition towards our vision of the future of a human-centred AI/IA, with the expectation that this analysis may be useful for similar organisations. In doing so, we illustrate tensions between theory and application, humans and technology, and show how keeping those aspects in balance is an important challenge and chance for bringing disruptive emerging technologies successfully into practice.},

abstract = {Human movement has historically been approached as a functional component of interaction within human computer interaction. Yet movement is not only functional, it is also highly expressive. In our research, we explore how movement expertise as articulated in Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) can contribute to the design of computational models of movement's expressive qualities as defined in the framework of Laban Efforts. We include experts in LMA in our design process, in order to select a set of suitable multimodal sensors as well as to compute features that closely correlate to the definitions of Efforts in LMA. Evaluation of our model shows that multimodal data combining positional, dynamic and physiological information allows for a better characterization of Laban Efforts. We conclude with implications for design that illustrate how our methodology and our approach to multimodal capture and recognition of Effort qualities can be integrated to design interactive applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system that allows end users to design full body interactions with 3D animated virtual character through a process we call Interactive Performance Capture. This process is embodied in the sense that users design directly by moving and interacting using an interactive machine learning method. Two people improvise an interaction based only on their movements, one plays the part of the virtual character the other plays a real person. Their movements are recorded and they label it with metadata that identifies certain actions and responses. This labeled data is then used to train a Gaussian Mixture Model that is able to recognize new actions and generate suitable responses from the virtual character. A small study showed that users do indeed design in a very embodied way using movement directly as a means of thinking through and designing interactions.},

abstract = {Recent developments in robotics demonstrated that bioinspiration and embodiement are powerful tools to achieve robust behavior in presence of little control. In this context morphological design is usually performed by humans, following a set of heuristic principles: in general this can be limiting, both from an engineering and an artificial life perspectives. In this work we thus suggest a different approach, leveraging evolutionary techniques. The case study is the one of improving the locomotion capabilities of an existing bioinspired robot. First, we explore the behavior space of the robot to discover a number of qualitatively different morphology-enabled behaviors, from whose analysis design indications are gained. The suitability of novelty search -- a recent open-ended evolutionary algorithm -- for this intended purpose is demonstrated. Second, we show how it is possible to condense such behaviors into a reconfigurable robot capable of online morphological adaptation (morphosis, morphing). Examples of successful morphing are demonstrated, in which changing just one morphological parameter entails a dramatic change in the behavior: this is promising for a future robot design. The approach here adopted represents a novel computed-aided, bioinspired, design paradigm, merging human and artificial creativity. This may result in interesting implications also for artificial life, having the potential to contribute in exploring underwater locomotion "as-it-could-be".},

abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant source of suffering, disability and societal cost in the US. However, while the ability to detect a person's risk for developing persistent pain is desirable for timely assessment, management, treatment, and reduced health care costs---no objective measure to detect clinical pain intensity exist. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have deployed clinical decision- making and assessment tools to enhance pain risk detection across core social and clinical domains. Yet, risk assessment models are only as "good" as the data they are based on. Thus, ensuring fairness is also a critical component of equitable care in both the short and long term. This paper takes an intersectional and public health approach to AI fairness in the context of pain and invisible disability, suggesting that computational ethnography is a multimodal and participatory real-world data (RWD) methodology that can be used to enhance the curation of intersectional knowledge bases, thereby expanding existing boundaries of AI fairness in terms of inclusiveness and transparency for pain and invisible disability use cases.},

abstract = {Agent-based participatory simulations are laboratory experiments designed like agent-based simulations and where humans access the simulation as software agents.This paper describes the outcomes of six experiments lasting up to two hours each, where human players took part in an iterated game derived from the El Farol bar problem. Agents decide synchronously to go to the bar or to stay home and the benefit depends on the bar attendance, with a threshold effect: it is better to stay home if more than 60% of the agents go. Contrasting with the original version of this problem, we allowed agents, and therefore humans, to communicate before they took their decision.The first two experiments allowed us to train participants and to introduce the notion of teams. Teams represented coalitions within the game and positively affected scoring, but they were not part of an obvious solution to the problem and they did not enforce cooperative behavior in the game.Drawing from these experiments, we designed autonomous agents reproducing strategies of the participants. These agents took part in the last four participatory experiments and we observed the formation of coalitions between agents, between humans and between agents and humans.},

abstract = {Digital products and services are commonplace in our personal lives where software and its algorithms provide assistance and amenities. However, interactive systems within industrial settings have yet to catch up with consumer products, especially with regard to the quality of interaction and user experience. With the rise of automation and data exchange on massive scales, the role of human work is challenged and the importance of cooperation emphasized. New concepts of smart factories in which machines and software are doing parts of the work tasks emerge, drastically altering the nature of work in industrial settings from manual labor to increasingly complex tasks. HCI and especially CSCW offer concepts, technical tools and methods to cope with this disruptive shift towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Networked assistive systems, for instance, are capable of individually addressing and satisfying the diverse needs of a heterogeneous workforce. We propose this workshop to discuss new perspectives on HCI and CSCW in industrial contexts with regard to the emerging IIoT. The goal of the workshop is to explore the design space of IIoT applications, its implications on cooperative work and to formulate new research opportunities to current challenges.},

abstract = {Investigations of facial analysis (FA) technologies-such as facial detection and facial recognition-have been central to discussions about Artificial Intelligence's (AI) impact on human beings. Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

A major challenge thereby is that project consortia need to establish a distributed developer community that effectively and resource-efficiently aligns development efforts with the goals and needs of complex societal constellations beyond project lifetime. In this paper we extract empirical evidence from longitudinal studies in two large-scale research projects to outline typical challenges in such problem contexts and to develop an open source software engineering methodology for research projects, including supportive infrastructure and social instruments of community building and awareness.

abstract = {Social media platforms provide active communication channels during mass convergence and emergency events such as disasters caused by natural hazards. As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings. We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.},

abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},

abstract = {Learning the dependency relations among entities and the hierarchy formed by these relations by mapping entities into some order embedding space can effectively enable several important applications, including knowledge base completion and prerequisite relations prediction. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to learn a good order embedding due to the existence of partial ordering and missing relations in the observed data. Moreover, most application scenarios do not provide non-trivial negative dependency relation instances. We therefore propose a framework that performs dependency relation prediction by exploring both rich semantic and hierarchical structure information in the data. In particular, we propose several negative sampling strategies based on graph-specific centrality properties, which supplement the positive dependency relations with appropriate negative samples to effectively learn order embeddings. This research not only addresses the needs of automatically recovering missing dependency relations, but also unravels dependencies among entities using several real-world datasets, such as course dependency hierarchy involving course prerequisite relations, job hierarchy in organizations, and paper citation hierarchy. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the prediction accuracy as well as to gain insights using the learned order embedding.},

abstract = {Autonomous Passenger Shuttles (APS) are rapidly becoming an urban public transit alternative. Traversing populous commercial and residential centers, these shuttles are already operating in several cities. In the absence of a human driver and embedded means of communicating the autonomous shuttle's intent, the task of seamlessly navigating crosswalks and pedestrian-friendly zones becomes a challenging pursuit for pedestrians.We contribute to the emerging notion of AV-Pedestrian Interaction by examining the context of autonomous passenger shuttles (APS) in real-world settings, and by comparing four different classes of visual signals -- namely instructional, symbolic, metaphorical, and anthropomorphic -- designed to communicate the shuttle's intentions. Following a participatory methodology involving local residents and public transport service provider, and working within the framework of inflexible road traffic regulations concerning the operation and testing of autonomous vehicles, we conducted a participatory design workshop, a qualitative, and a survey study. The findings revealed differences across these four classes of signals in terms of pedestrians' subjective perceptions. Anthropomorphic signals were identified as the preferred and effective modality in terms of pedestrians' interpretation of the communicated intent and their perceived sense of attention, confidence, and calmness. Additionally, pedestrians' experiences while judging the intention of transitionary vehicular states (starting/slowing) were reported as perplexing and evoked stress. These findings were translated into design and policy implications in collaboration with other stakeholders, and exemplify a viable way for assimilating human factors research in urban mobility.},

abstract = {Research in robotics and human-robot interaction is becoming more and more mature. Additionally, more affordable social robots are being released commercially. Thus, industry is currently demanding ideas for viable commercial applications to situate social robots in public spaces and enhance customers experience. However, present literature in human-robot interaction does not provide a clear set of guidelines and a methodology to (i) identify commercial applications for robotic platforms able to position the users» needs at the centre of the discussion and (ii) ensure the creation of a positive user experience. With this paper we propose to fill this gap by providing a methodology for the design of robotic applications including these desired features, suitable for integration by researchers, industry, business and government organisations. As we will show in this paper, we successfully employed this methodology for an exploratory field study involving the trial implementation of a commercially available, social humanoid robot at an airport.},

Collaboration support tools aim to reduce the adverse effects of this restricted access to the fluid intermixing of speech, gesturing, writing and sketching by providing mechanisms to enhance the awareness of distributed participants of each others' actions.In this work we explore novel ways to leverage the capabilities of multimodal context-aware systems to bridge co-located and distributed collaboration contexts. We describe a system that allows participants at remote sites to collaborate in building a project schedule via sketching on multiple distributed whiteboards, and show how participants can be made aware of naturally occurring pointing gestures that reference diagram constituents as they are performed by remote participants.The system explores the multimodal fusion of pen, speech and 3D gestures, coupled to the dynamic construction of a semantic representation of the interaction, anchored on the sketched diagram, to provide feedback that overcomes some of the intrinsic ambiguities of pointing gestures.},

The Ambient Kitchen is a lab-based replication of a real kitchen where careful design has hidden the additional technology, and allows both the evaluation of pervasive computing prototypes and the simultaneous capture of the multiple synchronized streams of sensor data. Previous work exploring the requirements for situated support for people with cognitive impairments motivated the design of the physical and technical infrastructure and we describe both our motivations and previous work on interaction design in kitchen environments. Finally, we describe how our lab-based prototype has been put to use as: a design tool for designers; a design tool for users; an observatory to collect sensor data for activity recognition algorithm development, and an evaluation test bed. The limitations and advantages of lab-based, as opposed to in situ home-based testing, are discussed},

abstract = {Most commonly used approaches to developing automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems are Big Data-driven and machine learning-based. However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders' tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders' needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project "Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia" to illustrate our method. We intend this paper to contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning the use of algorithms in supporting critical decision-making in society.},

The traceability between releases and commits would facilitate a systematic choice of history in units of the project evolution scale (i.e., commits that constitute a software release). For example, the major release 25.0 in Chrome is mapped to the earliest revision 157687 and latest revision 165096 in the trunk. Using this traceability, an empirical study is reported on the frequency distribution of file changes for different release windows. In Chrome, the majority (50%) of the committed files change only once between a pair of consecutive releases. This trend is reversed after expanding the window size to at least 10. That is, the majority (50%) of the files change multiple times when commits constituting 10 or greater releases are considered. These results suggest that a training set of at least 10 releases is needed to provide a prediction coverage for majority of the files.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of the iconic Aware Home project [39] in 1999, the notion of “living laboratory” has been taken up and developed in HCI research. Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed—inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as “Visited Places,” “Instrumented Places,” “Instrumented People,” “Lived-in Places,” and “Innovation Spaces.” In the first part of this article, we describe in detail the method and outcome of our analysis that draws out the five strands. Building on the results of the first part, in the second part of this article, each of the five types of living lab is discussed using some of the prototypical examples of that kind presented in the literature. Finally, we discuss the raison d’\^{e}tre and future position of the living lab as a method within HCI research and design and in relation to advances in sensing technologies and the emerging world of intelligent built environments (e.g., smart city and smart home).},

abstract = {We propose HeadGesture, a hands-free input approach to interact with Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices. Using HeadGesture, users do not need to raise their arms to perform gestures or operate remote controllers in the air. Instead, they perform simple gestures with head movement to interact with the devices. In this way, users' hands are free to perform other tasks, e.g., taking notes or manipulating tools. This approach also reduces the hand occlusion of the field of view [11] and alleviates arm fatigue [7]. However, one main challenge for HeadGesture is to distinguish the defined gestures from unintentional movements. To generate intuitive gestures and address the issue of gesture recognition, we proceed through a process of Exploration - Design - Implementation - Evaluation. We first design the gesture set through experiments on gesture space exploration and gesture elicitation with users. Then, we implement algorithms to recognize the gestures, including gesture segmentation, data reformation and unification, feature extraction, and machine learning based classification. Finally, we evaluate user performance of HeadGesture in the target selection experiment and application tests. The results demonstrate that the performance of HeadGesture is comparable to mid-air hand gestures, measured by completion time. Additionally, users feel significantly less fatigue than when using hand gestures and can learn and remember the gestures easily. Based on these findings, we expect HeadGesture to be an efficient supplementary input approach for HMD devices.},

abstract = {Multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) support multiagent probabilistic inference in distributed large problem domains. Inference in MSBNs can be performed effectively using their compiled representations. The compilation involves cooperative moralization and triangulation of the set of local graphical structures that collectively defines the dependencies among domain variables. Privacy of agents prevents us from compiling MSBNs by first assembling graphical subnets at a central location and then compiling their union. In earlier work, agents perform compilation in a limited parallel via a depth-first traversal of the local structures organized in a tree structure (called hypertree). Agents need some synchronization with each other. In this paper, we present an iterative method, by which multiple agents compile MSBNs asynchronously. Compared to the traversal method, the iterative one is self-adaptive and robust.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume of the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches for processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of information about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capability in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-time multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various modalities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapters discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on tools and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expanding field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep learning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.}

abstract = {We compare two approaches for exploring large, hierarchical data spaces on mobile devices using facets. While the first approach arranges the facets in a 3x3 grid, the second approach makes use of a scrollable list of facets for exploring the data. As concrete scenario, we use category hierarchies that are dynamically obtained from different, distributed social media sources. We have conducted a between-group experiment of the two approaches with 64 subjects (41 male, 23 female) executing the same set of tasks of typical mobile users' information needs. The results show that subjects using the grid-based approach require significantly more time and more clicks for completing the tasks. However, regarding the subjects' satisfaction there is no significant difference between the two approaches. Thus, if efficiency is not the primary objective, the grid-based approach might be of interest as it provides a navigation element that allows the users to see the exact position in the data space. This might be a very useful feature in scenarios where knowing the exact position is quite crucial such as browsing classification schemas in digital libraries or other formal taxonomies.},

abstract = {Software requirements express the requirements and constraints on a software product that contributes to the satisfaction of some 'need' in the real world. Ambiguity is a major problem in requirements specification. At its most basic, a requirement is a property that a system must exhibit in order for it to meet the system's motivating need. We ignore intentional ambiguity or the ambiguity that exists in early stages of requirements elicitation and focus on ambiguity that remains in a so-called final natural language requirements document. Ambiguity is a problem because the different readers of the requirements specification may understand different things.An essential property of all requirements is that they should be verifiable. In a typical project there will be a large number of requirements derived from different sources and expressed at different levels of detail. The existing Requirement Engineering Techniques and Methodologies are supporting to a specific set of activity like Elicitation or validation. Requirement Engineering develops a mutual understanding between customers and project teams about the product or system requirements. An agreed-upon and approved product requirement becomes the initial baseline for product design. Knowledge of ambiguous, inconsistent requirements to requirement engineer increases the capability to view the requirements from different perspectives.This paper discusses the requirement generation process and allied activities in it. It also focuses on methodologies, models and techniques for requirement engineering. As a part of applying complete requirement engineering, we claim that the crucial issues like architecture and design in system development can be effectively addressed.},

In this session, I report findings of youth being@play with digital media and technology at 101 Technology Fun, two intensive one-week gaming and robotic research camps held in a technology-rich lab at the University of British Columbia. Child-technology interrelations are characterized according to a six-fold typology that draws from social, ethical and cognitive domains: recognition, feeling, attention, engagement, contact and attachment. My goal is to educe a sensitive attunement and thoughtful attentiveness towards understanding how youth act-in and perceive their being-in this milieu technique. I invite you to critically consider and to reflect deeply upon how today's youth are be-thinged [bedingt]: simultaneously dependent upon, inhabited by, immersed in, and indifferent to the digital media and technology in their lives [9]. If we take a step back and depart from our pre-determined views and the normative assumptions that legitimatize the already-known, might it be possible to think differently and to question the as-yet unimagined possibilities for technology to shape our children's worlds, particularly in ways that escape our scrutiny of thought?},

abstract = {Modeling has a strong focus in current science learning frameworks as a critical skill for students to learn. However, understanding students' scientific models and their modeling practices at scale is a difficult task that has not been taken up by the research literature. The complex variables involved in classroom learning, such as teacher differences, increase the difficulty of understanding this problem. This work begins with an exploration of the methods used to explore students' scientific modeling in the learning sciences space and the frameworks developed to characterize student modeling practices. Learning analytics can be used to leverage these frameworks of scientific modeling practices to explore questions around students' scientific models and their modeling practices. These analyses are focused around the use of EcoSurvey, a collaborative, digital tool used in high-school biology classrooms to model the local ecosystem. This tool was deployed in ten biology classrooms and used with varying degrees of success. There are significant teacher-level differences found in the activity sequences of students using the EcoSurvey tool. The theoretical metrics around scientific modeling practices and automatically extracted feature sequences were also used in a classification task to automatically determine a particular student's teacher. These results underline the power of learning analytics methods to give insight into how modeling practices are realized in the classroom. This work also informs changes to modeling tools, associated curricula, and supporting professional development around scientific modeling.},

abstract = {Digital humanities methods and techniques have been applied to a wide spectrum of disciplines with results there were not attainable otherwise. However, uncertainty is present in any DH endeavour, in various types and degrees, due to the very nature of both humanist research and the intervention of computers to enable such kind of research methodologies. On the one hand, information sources need to be converted into digital form and, on the other hand, the resulting digital objects are processed to obtain summaries, geographic and temporal distributions, networks, patterns, etc., that are presented to and interpreted by the researchers or users of the DH projects. From the digitalization to the interpretation, both the computational and cognitive steps involved are subject to uncertainty. The track "Uncertainty in Digital Humanities" of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2018), tries to bring together researchers in Digital Humanities and reflect on the opportunities and challenges related to the way in which uncertainty can be better understood and pave the way towards appropriate methods and tools of dealing with uncertainty that improve the support to humanists when generating new knowledge.},

abstract = {Workplace collaborators make use of diverse types of documents and other resources. Traditionally, each type of document has been stored in its own repository, and people have had to manage multiple documents in multiple storage services. Workplace collaborators often have complex, ad hoc working relations that are partially executed through their shared documents. Traditionally, dependencies among documents and other objects have gone unrecorded, or have been stored in a piecemeal manner inside the documents, or have been objectified and rigidified in workflow engines. Workplace collaborators often need to coordinate with one another, both asynchronously and in real-time, and often in the context of their shared documents. Traditionally, people had no idea of the status of their collaborators, or they have had to consult other, unrelated services for awareness or presence information about their colleagues.We aim to change that. I will describe our research, findings, and possible futures of systems and services that are intended to unify the ways that people collaborate with and through shared documents. In our ActivityExplorer project, users innovated new ways of using our software, showing that a service with collections of shared documents, fine-grained access control, persistent communications, and real-time status information could serve diverse needs of a workplace of individuals, teams, and communities. Our Unified Activity Management project explored the harvesting of collective enactments, and their crystallization into work practices templates and rich placeholders for future collaborations. These ideas have led to successful technology transfer, and are making their way into products.In the course of this work, we sometimes found that simple ideas were much more popular than expected, paradoxically creating new challenges for users. I will describe two of those challenges, and our attempts to meet them. This new research has led us into domains of interruption management, machine learning, and very much into social computing, including technology transfer into another generation of collaboration products.People work together through direct communication and through shared documents. At every turn, people surprise us with their ingenuity and their ability to create new human and technological solutions with the systems that we offer them. I will close with a discussion of the concept of reinvention (innovation through usage), and how technology developers and users can learn from one another through cycles of development and usage, with innovative contributions from all parties at each turn of the cycle.},

Futuristic autobiographies are the creative work of the researchers and participants. Grounded in empirical and background work, researchers pose several stories involving the participant as a character about a future state with robots. Participants are then asked to weave fictional autobiographies to explain what led to this future state. Via a case study in which futuristic autobiographies were used with 23 roboticists, we detail the process involved in developing and implementing this method. When futuristic autobiographies are employed and carefully crafted from background research, they allow informants to speak for themselves on how their practices and values are intertwined now and in the future. We highlight both the benefits and challenges of futuristic autobiographies as a way to elicit rich stories about values. We argue that futuristic autobiographies are a promising addition to the current qualitative methods toolkit used in HRI.},

Since the success of such treatments is related to a patients emotion regulation capabilities, we employ a real-time social signal interpretation together with a computational simulation of emotion regulation that influences the agent's social behavior as well as the situational selection of verbal treatment strategies. Overall, our interdisciplinary approach sketches a novel integrative concept for Social Agents as assistants for burn-out patients.},

abstract = {Worldwide, manufacturers are reimagining the future of their workforce and its connection to technology. Rather than replacing humans, Industry 5.0 explores how humans and robots can best complement one another's unique strengths. However, realizing this vision requires an in-depth understanding of how workers view the positive and negative attributes of their jobs, and the place of robots within it. In this paper, we explore the relationship between work attributes and automation goals by engaging in field research at a manufacturing plant. We conducted 50 face-to-face interviews with assembly-line workers (n = 50), which we analyzed using discourse analysis and social constructivist methods. We found that the work attributes deemed most positive by participants include social interaction, movement and exercise, (human) autonomy, problem solving, task variety, and building with their hands. The main negative work attributes included health and safety issues, feeling rushed, and repetitive work. We identified several ways robots could help reduce negative work attributes and enhance positive ones, such as reducing work interruptions and cultivating physical and psychological well-being. Based on our findings, we created a set of integration considerations for organizations planning to deploy robotics technology, and discuss how the manufacturing and HRI communities can explore these ideas in the future.},

abstract = {If we expect our children to be driving technology design agendas in the future, we must first help them recognize that opinions and beliefs are baked into the technologies that we create and that these opinions may serve some groups of people more than others. In this paper, we discuss an ethical design activity completed by 19 middle school-aged children. The activity encourages students to see technical systems as socio-technical systems, to engage them in stakeholder analysis, and to apply ethical design tools in order to redesign YouTube. Results indicate students are capable of transforming into critical users and ethical designers of technology. They are able to recognize the underlying design agendas for popular technologies such as YouTube, identify stakeholders who shape those design agendas, and apply an array of tools to reimagine technologies in a more inclusive manner.},

abstract = {Collaboration is an important skill of the 21st century. It can take place in an online (or remote) setting or in a co-located (or face-to-face) setting. With the large scale adoption of sensor use, studies on co-located collaboration (CC) has gained momentum. CC takes place in physical spaces where the group members share each other’s social and epistemic space. This involves subtle multimodal interactions such as gaze, gestures, speech, discourse which are complex in nature. The aim of this PhD is to detect these interactions and then use these insights to build an automated real-time feedback system to facilitate co-located collaboration.},

isbn = {9781538685556},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Many new technologies are being built to support people with dementia. However, they largely focus on the people with dementia; consequently, informal caregivers, one of the most important stakeholders in dementia care, remain invisible within the technology design space. In this paper, we present a six-month long, community-based design research process where we collaborated with dementia caregiver support groups to design robots for dementia caregiving. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we broaden the context of dementia robot design to give a more prominent role to informal family caregivers in the co-design process. Second, we provide new design guidelines that contextualize robots within the family caregiving paradigm, which suggest new roles and behaviors of robots. These include lessening emotional labor by communicating information caregivees do not want to hear (e.g., regarding diet or medication) or providing redirection during emotionally difficult times, as well as facilitating positive shared moments. Third, our work found connections between certain robot attributes and their relationship to the stage of dementia a caregivee is experiencing. For example, caregivers wanted their robots to facilitate interaction with their caregivees in early stages of dementia, yet be in the background. However, for later stages of dementia, they wanted robots to replace caregiver-caregivee interaction to lessen their emotional burden, and be foregrounded. These connections provide important insights in to how we think about adaptability and long-term interaction in HRI. We hope our work provides new avenues for HRI researchers to studying robots for dementia caregivers by engaging in community-based design.},

In our approach we consider whether this is a case of posing robots as solutions to wicked problems or if robots can be considered wicked design problems in themselves. At the same time we make an argument for adopting a research through design approach. Our stance suggests that by viewing robots as composed of design materials we can sensitively address and in the long run perhaps even avoid wicked problems related to robotics.},

Previous work has also argued that mid-air gestural input can cause discomfort and arm fatigue over time, which can be addressed in a desktop setting by allowing users to gesture in alternative restful arm positions (e.g., elbow rests on desk). However, it is unclear if and how gesture preferences and gesture designs would be different for alternative arm positions. In order to inquire these research question we report on a user and choice based gesture elicitation study in which 10 participants designed gestures for different arm positions. We provide an in-depth qualitative analysis and detailed categorization of gestures, discussing commonalities and differences in the gesture sets based on a "think aloud" protocol, video recordings, and self-reports on user preferences.},

abstract = {Participatory simulations are conducted to improve our knowledge of human behaviors, to help in solving conflicts, to shape interaction protocols between humans and to teach some aspects of collective management.Agent-based participatory simulations differ from other kinds of participatory simulations including role playing games and experimental economics simulations. The control architecture of the agents, in these simulations, is more or less integrally replaced by a human player and the interactions between players are limited by the communication protocols designed for the agents, usually the exchange of electronic messages logged for further analysis. Such systems can be considered as ideal multi-agent systems featuring cognitive and intelligent agents. Previous work demonstrated that running this kind of simulations helps to design and improve multi-agent simulations.In this paper, we present a series of agent-based participatory experiments studying negotiation in an abstract case of common resource pool management. The roles were designed in such a way that conflicts should emerge during the negotiations. Observing the behavior of human players, we noticed the apparition of power relations between players. We observed that this power in negotiations was unrelated to any a priori dependence between agents or between roles but was instead drawn from strategies and, more surprisingly, this power was built on an emerging ontology.},

The study involved two groups of learners, ages 13 to 15, over twelve months. The physical robots have a dual-mode ability that allowed learners to record and observe motions while controlling the robots manually by hand as well as under program control. A custom-made Logo programming environment together with new 2D graphical elements was created. The results not only show examples of Balance Control concepts that emerged, but highlight the learning process that was made accessible only through the computational technology.},

abstract = {Open card sorting is used by information architects to gather insights from users to incorporate feedback into an information architecture. In theory, it is one of the more inexpensive, user-centered design methods available to practitioners, but hidden costs make it less likely to be conducted properly and affect the quality of results produced. The following proposes a new card sorting method called the Modified-Delphi card sort to replace the Open card sort. The Modified-Delphi card sort is based on a well-known forecasting technique called the Delphi method. Instead of producing individual models that are then analyzed as a whole, participants work with a single model that is proposed and modified throughout the study. The Modified-Delphi card sorting method produces more useful results to aid in the design of an information architecture than the Open card sorting method.A series of studies were conducted to directly compare the Modified-Delphi and Open cart sorting methods. First, two parallel studies using both methods were conducted with the same dataset and number of participants. Then, two studies were conducted on the results of the parallel studies: a heuristic review and ranking with information design experts and an Inverse card sort with additional users of the proposed architecture. The Modified-Delphi card sorting method produced results that were found to be at least as good as the Open card sorting method results and in some cases, better.},

Prior analyses of firm-related forums have considered all participants in the aggregate, failing to recognize the potential for diversity within the populations. However, distinctive groups of forum participants may represent various interests and stakes in a firm worthy of consideration. To perform the stakeholder analyses, the Stakeholder Analyzer system for firm-related web forums is developed following the design science paradigm of information systems research. The design of the system and its approach to stakeholder analysis is guided by two kernel theories, the stakeholder theory of the firm and the systemic functional linguistic theory. A stakeholder analysis identifies distinctive groups of forum participants with shared characteristics expressed in discussion and evaluates their specific opinions and interests in the firm. Stakeholder analyses are performed in six major firm-related forums hosted on Yahoo Finance over a 3-month period. The relationships between measures extracted from the forums and subsequent daily firm stock returns are examined using multiple linear regression models, revealing statistically significant indicators of firm stock returns in the discussions of the stakeholder groups of each firm with stakeholder-model-adjusted R2 values reaching 0.83. Daily stock return prediction is also performed for 31 trading days, and stakeholder models correctly predicted the direction of return on 67% of trading days and generated an impressive 17% return in simulated trading of the six firm stocks. These evaluations demonstrate that the stakeholder analyses provided more refined assessments of the firm-related forums, yielding measures at the stakeholder group level that better explain and predict daily firm stock returns than aggregate forum-level information.},

We explore this approach through DynamicProblem, a proof-of-concept system for experimentation on components of digital problems, which provides interfaces for authoring of experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, and learning tips. To rapidly turn data from experiments into practical improvements, the system uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to analyze students' ratings of which conditions are helpful, and present conditions to future students in proportion to the evidence they are higher rated. We evaluated the system by collaboratively deploying experiments in the courses of three mathematics instructors. They reported benefits in reflecting on their pedagogy, and having a new method for improving online problems for future students.},

Along this, the engagement of citizens and other stakeholders both in data provision and co-creation continues to be crucial. One way to increase citizen participation is through the introduction of gamification elements into the digital government services. In this paper, the authors review literature and projects on gamification as a tool for improving citizen participation rates in Government 3.0. Based on this, avenues for further research are outlined in the area, taking into consideration a) the knowledge collected from recent EU-funded projects involving gamification and b) the opinions of experts in the domain, which were collected along interactive workshops. Finally, five research needs are identified and outlined for gamification in digital government.},

abstract = {Design in many settings is an inherently collective and creative undertaking, with phenomena of emergence at the heart of the activity. Cognitive accounts of emergence in the context of design have not taken its collective nature into account. At the same time accounts of collective emergence do not recognize certain salient attributes of design, including the importance of visual thinking and various media for external representation. With reference to two distinct theories of emergence, Oxman's account of design emergence in terms of visual cognition, and Sawyer's account of collaborative emergence in conversation and performance, this paper reports results from a study of a high-performing, technologically mediated concurrent design practice. Participant observation, interviews, and video interaction analysis were used to render the creative process of engineering design in fine-grained detail. The resulting insights support aspects of both theories in that creative activity appears to proceed substantially through modalities of visual cognition, while collaborative products are arrived at through an essentially collective process involving multiple participants and unpredictable developments. The combined view presents a richer picture than either theory alone.},

The first study applied two methods of Value Sensitive Design, namely stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these two cases, this paper responds to a need of practical means to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics systems. These two cases demonstrate that Value Sensitive Design could be a viable approach for balancing a wide range of human values, which tend to encompass and surpass ethical issues, in learning analytics design.},

Interaction techniques that allow one user to efficiently control many screens, or that allow several users to collaborate on one distant screen, are still hot topics, and are often considered as two different questions. Standard approaches require a strong coupling between the physical location of input device, and users. We propose to consider these two questions through the same basic concept, that uncouples physical location and user input, using a mid-air approach. We present the concept of mimetic interaction spaces (MIS), a dynamic user-definition of an imaginary input space thanks to an iconic gesture, that can be used to define mid-air interaction techniques. We describe a participative design user-study, that shows this technique has interesting acceptability and elicit some definition and deletion gestures. We finally describe a design space for MIS-based interaction, and show how such concept may be used for multi-screen control, as well as screen sharing in pervasive environments.},

abstract = {Conversational agent technology is an emerging paradigm for creating a social environment in online groups that is conducive to effective teamwork. Prior work has demonstrated advantages in terms of learning gains and satisfaction scores when groups learning together online have been supported by conversational agents that employ Balesian social strategies. This prior work raises two important questions that are addressed in this article. The first question is one of generality. Specifically, are the positive effects of the designed support specific to learning contexts? Or are they in evidence in other collaborative task domains as well? We present a study conducted within a collaborative decision-making task where we see that the positive effects of the Balesian social strategies extend to this new context. The second question is whether it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the Balesian social strategies by increasing the context sensitivity with which the social strategies are triggered. To this end, we present technical work that increases the sensitivity of the triggering. Next, we present a user study that demonstrates an improvement in performance of the support agent with the new, more sensitive triggering policy over the baseline approach from prior work.The technical contribution of this article is that we extend prior work where such support agents were modeled using a composition of conversational behaviors integrated within an event-driven framework. Within the present approach, conversation is orchestrated through context-sensitive triggering of the composed behaviors. The core effort involved in applying this approach involves building a set of triggering policies that achieve this orchestration in a time-sensitive and coherent manner. In line with recent developments in data-driven approaches for building dialog systems, we present a novel technique for learning behavior-specific triggering policies, deploying it as part of our efforts to improve a socially capable conversational tutor agent that supports collaborative learning.},

However, as we attempt to design for more complex operations, the expectation of spatial manipulation becomes infeasible.We introduce Multi-tap Sliders for operation in what we call abstract parametric spaces that do not have an obvious literal spatial representation, such as exposure, brightness, contrast and saturation for image editing. This new widget design promotes multi-touch interaction for prolonged use in scenarios that require adjustment of multiple parameters as part of an operation. The multi-tap sliders encourage the user to keep her visual focus on the target, instead of the requiring to look back at the interface.Our research emphasizes ergonomics, clear visual design, and fluid transition between the selection of parameters and their subsequent adjustment for a given operation. We demonstrate a new technique for quickly selecting and adjusting multiple numerical parameters. A preliminary user study points out improvements over the traditional sliders.},

abstract = {The U.S. Child Welfare System (CWS) is charged with improving outcomes for foster youth; yet, they are overburdened and underfunded. To overcome this limitation, several states have turned towards algorithmic decision-making systems to reduce costs and determine better processes for improving CWS outcomes. Using a human-centered algorithmic design approach, we synthesize 50 peer-reviewed publications on computational systems used in CWS to assess how they were being developed, common characteristics of predictors used, as well as the target outcomes. We found that most of the literature has focused on risk assessment models but does not consider theoretical approaches (e.g., child-foster parent matching) nor the perspectives of caseworkers (e.g., case notes).

abstract = {During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in supporting social play through the design of collocated digital games, alongside efforts to better understand social-physical modes of play. In this paper, we present relevant insights from a well-established gaming community, the larp (Live Action Role Play) community. This community has a longstanding tradition of making use of costumes, physical environments, and objects to shape player experience. We conducted a survey completed by 39 larpers concerning how they use digital technology in larp, and the way technology is designed and appropriated to augment the larp experience. Here, we present early results in the form of a preliminary taxonomy of technologies in larps, as well as key trends for design, use, and appropriation of technology to impact in-game social and emotional experience.},

The proposed solution of this paper uses XML Product Map (XPM) of collaborative concept to represent semantically consistent business processes, and adopts common action concept pool and XPM documents to design heterogeneous business processes that are suitable for heterogeneous business process transformation. We motivated the approach with a real-world PVC poncho trade problem and explained it in architecture of collaborative process design and automatic service provision. We reported the implementation specification within a hybrid human-agent framework, where four layers of system modules are specified. The approach is evaluated based on a new semantic impact chain method particularly for evaluating concept consistency in meaning representation between heterogeneous contexts of business processes.},

abstract = {We propose an approach for improving the digitization of shape and color of 3D artworks in a cluttered environment using 3D laser scanning and flash photography. To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.},

abstract = {The design of user interfaces (UIs), such as World Wide Web pages, usually consists in a human designer mapping one particular problem (e.g., the demands of a customer) to one particular solution (i.e., the UI). In this article, a technology based on Genetic Programming is proposed to automate critical parts of the design process. In this approach, designers are supposed to define basic content elements and ways to combine them, which are then automatically composed and tested with real users by a genetic algorithm in order to find optimized compositions. Such a strategy enables the exploration of large design state-spaces in a systematic manner, hence going beyond traditional A/B testing approaches. In relation to similar techniques also based on genetic algorithms, this system has the advantage of being more general, providing the basis of an overall programmatic UI design workflow, and of calculating the fitness of solutions incrementally. To illustrate and evaluate the approach, an experiment based on the optimization of landing pages is provided. The empirical result obtained, though preliminary, is statistically significant and corroborates the hypothesis that the technique works.},

abstract = {We are pleased to share with you the Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Creativity and Cognition. The Proceedings contains research from an amazingly diverse array of disciplines, perspectives, and methodological approaches. The conference topic of 'everyday creativity' reminds us of the varied ways in which individuals and groups can be innovative, inventive, ingenious, and resourceful not only in the arts, science, engineering, and design, but also in addressing situations that arise in everyday life.Out of 137 submitted full papers we could publish only 34, for a full-paper acceptance rate of 25%. The Proceedings also includes a set of eleven short papers from the Graduate Student Symposium, showcasing the emerging perspectives of new voices in this community. The 14 demos and 36 posters presented at the conference are represented here by short papers, as are the thirteen art pieces and seven live performances. The Proceedings also includes brief outlines of invited keynote talks, conference workshops, and tutorials. This year's papers fall into six broad themes of Young Creators; Inclusion and Identity; Culture and Context; Theories, Methods, Metrics, and Tools; Art and Craft; and Design.A group of three papers on Young Creators looks at children in science, music, and storytelling. One paper studies two online communities that mediate children working with scientists; another reports on teenagers doing computer music; and the third on technology-augmented environments for children's storytelling.Two Inclusion and Identity papers look at social aspects. One discusses a project that engaged older men in participatory design, in an effort to tackle digital exclusion. The other paper in this category confronts questions of prejudice, stigma, and the creation of social identities in online environments.The four Culture and Context papers go beyond individuals and view creativity as a phenomenon in the broader community. Two papers on childhood and education examine, respectively, the American and Australian contexts; a third describes six creativity support tools developed in a community-based robotics project. The fourth paper reports on the use of cultural probes for design in a village in Rwanda.Seven papers on Theories, Metrics, Methods, and Tools view creativity as a process that can be explicitly modeled, measured, and supported. One establishes the 'Creativity Support Index', a survey metric to help researchers and designers evaluate the level of creativity support that various systems provide. Another reports on a study using 'Computational Metaphor Identification,' a textual analysis technique, to foster metaphorical creativity in science education. A third paper investigates how practitioners make sense of their own creative work using the 'Repertory Grid Technique'. A fourth discusses a computational framework that addresses the worth of ideas ascribed by agents embedded in a social world. A fifth, empirical, paper reports on three perspectives on creative interaction: productive, structural, and longitudinal. A sixth considers serendipity in people's interactions with computers, revealing a space for computer-based systems to support serendipitous creativity, innovation and discovery. And a seventh paper studies the relationship of consuming alcohol with perceived and actual creativity.Five papers look at creativity in art--film scoring, theatre, literature, and interactive art--and two more look at craft-- one at digitally printed paper collage; the other at knitting. The paper on film scoring presents a design study, including prototypes, for supporting synchronous and asynchronous collaboration among stakeholders. The theatre paper asks: What are actors thinking as they engage in improvisational theatre? The literature paper describes the RiTa computational toolkit for writing, and its use in a computational literature class. A case study of the design of an interactive art piece and the audience's experience reflects on the relationship of play and complexity. And a reflective paper looks at algorithmic art from its early days to postulate about relationships between art, artists, creativity, and society.Finally, the largest group of papers is about design. Three focus on creative processes in design, for example papers on 'microsketching,' prototyping, and generative walk-throughs. The fourth investigates how designers can learn from stroke patients' designs for assistive devices. A case study in biologically inspired (biomimetic) design is the topic of a fifth paper in this group. A sixth paper looks at social creation and cultural cognition through the lens of visual and verbal protocols of an architectural design process. Using 'Business Process Excellence', a seventh design paper reports on a case study of how an engineering firm balances risk and creativity. An empirical study employing social network analysis finds that teams scoring higher on perspective taking and team cohesion produce more innovative final designs. The ninth paper in this group reports a fine-grained study of a concurrent engineering design practice using participant observation, interviews, and video interaction analysis. And the tenth describes design-based case studies to derive guidelines for embodied metaphorbased interactional models.},

abstract = {Citizen science is a form of collaboration that engages non-professionals as contributors to scientific research, typically through the processes of gathering, transforming or analyzing data. To date, research has documented examples of hugely successful citizen science projects, such as Zooniverse and eBird, but citizen science also includes hundreds of smaller citizen science and functionally similar digital humanities projects, operating from small-scale web platforms and in-person collaborative teams. Yet, it is unclear what the "science" of citizen science entails: What are the core research questions and methodologies for answering them? What theories and concepts have been associated with citizen science research to date? What are the technology needs for supporting successful research collaboration among diverse stakeholders and across distinctive types of citizen science projects? In this workshop, our goal is to (i) bring together researchers studying citizen science to form a coherent map summarizing the theories, methodologies and platforms that currently defines citizen science research, with a special focus on CHI and CSCW relevant topics (ii) brainstorm a list of fundamental open questions and ways to tackle them, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.},

We introduce a novel combination of existing design and evaluation methods in the form of a 5-step iterative process and show the feasibility of this method and some of the lessons learned through the design of a messaging application for two contexts (in car, walking). The iterative design process we employed included the following five basic steps: 1) identification of the limitations affecting the usage of different modalities in various contexts (contextual observations and context analysis) 2) identifying and selecting suitable interaction concepts and creating a general design for the multimodal application (storyboarding, use cases, interaction concepts, task breakdown, application UI and interaction design), 3) creating modality-specific UI designs, 4) rapid prototyping and 5) evaluating the prototype in naturalistic situations to find key issues to be taken into account in the next iteration. We have not only found clear indications that context affects users' preferences in the usage of modalities and interaction strategies but also identified some of these. For instance, while speech interaction was preferred in the car environment users did not consider it useful when they were walking. 2D (finger strokes) and especially 3D (tilt) gestures were preferred by walking users.},

Specifically, we propose how SARs might augment or offer more pro-active assistance over existing technologies such as smartphone applications, computer software and fitness trackers also designed to tackle this issue. In addition, we present a series of design implications for such SARs based on therapists' expert knowledge and best practices extracted from our results. This includes an initial set of SAR requirements and key considerations concerning personalised and adaptive interaction strategies.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of inferring the design intentions of a human by an intelligent virtual agent that collaborates with the human. First, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network model that relates design intentions, objectives, and solutions during a human's exploration of a problem space. We then train the model on design behaviors generated by a search agent and use the model parameters to infer the design intentions in a test set of real human behaviors. We find that our model is able to infer the exact intentions across three objectives associated with a sequence of design outcomes 31.3% of the time. Inference accuracy is 50.9% for the top two predictions and 67.2% for the top three predictions. For any singular intention over an objective, the model's mean F1-score is 0.719. This provides a reasonable foundation for an intelligent virtual agent to infer design intentions purely from design outcomes toward establishing joint intentions with a human designer. These results also shed light on the potential benefits and pitfalls in using simulated data to train a model for human design intentions.},

So taking this evidence into account, it is possible to devise an innovative collaborative learning scenario that teaches early mathematical concepts by telling and creating stories.

Yet as any tools, they shape the gaze, attitudes, and behaviors of designers. Moreover their generic nature tends to obscure the specific situations in which they were created. In reaction, grounding our work in adversarial design, we propose four tricky probes: believable design tools, which appear to be innocuous, but progressively engage designers in crossing boundaries of what should be acceptable. This is done by slowly derailing design research activities, leading to trigger reflection on the part of designers on their beliefs, practice, and the tools they use. Our probes raise issues at the intersection of design research and gender in urban service design, such as the use of pre-made algorithms to understand gendered patterns in urban movements.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a study concerning psychological ownership for digital entities in the context of collaborative working environments. In the first part of the paper we present a conceptual framework of ownership: various issues such as definition, effects, target factors and behavioral manifestation are explicated. We then focus on ownership marking, a behavioral manifestation that is closely tied to psychological ownership. We designed an experiment using DiamondTouch Table to investigate the effect of two of the most widely used ownership markers on users' attitudes and performance. Both performance and attitudinal differences were found, suggesting the significant role of ownership and ownership markers in the groupware and interactive workspaces design.},

abstract = {Recent public discussions about technologies and social values have called for greater consideration of ethics during technology development and deployment, leading many organizations to create and promote compliance- or checklist-oriented toolkits and frameworks to address values and ethical issues. However, surfacing discussion and consideration of ethics in broader, more open-ended ways during the design process may help surface unique needs, social corner cases, or new or different understandings of values and ethics. This one-day workshop will convene CSCW researchers and practitioners to propose and consider new interventions and approaches to ethics in design that go beyond formal checklist- and compliance-oriented approaches. CSCW's rich set of methods when investigating values and ethics provides a starting point for developing new approaches and interventions. These may potentially include design activities, games and roleplaying, critical making, changes to work practice and organizational structure, or conducting empirical research. Our goal is to explore multiple and alternative forms of values and ethics interventions, rather than coming to a particular 'best' approach. This workshop aims to map out a space of interventions for values and ethics, propose new approaches and interventions, and craft an agenda for experimenting with and evaluating new interventions.},

abstract = {Assistive robots are becoming an increasingly important application platform for research in robotics, AI, and HRI, as there is a pressing need to develop systems that support the elderly and people with disabilities, with a clear path to market. Yet, what remains unclear is whether current autonomous systems are already up to the task or whether additional HRI work is needed to make these systems acceptable and useful.In this article, we report our efforts of developing and evaluating an architecture for a fully autonomous robot designed to assist older adults with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in sorting their medications. The main goal for the robot is to aid users in a manner that maintains the autonomy of the user by providing cognitive and social support with varying levels of assistance. We first evaluated the robot with subjects drawn from a pool of university students, which is common practice in experimental work in psychology and HRI. As the results were very positive, we followed up with an evaluation using people with Parkinson’s disease, who surprisingly had mostly negative outcomes. We thus report our analysis of the differences in the evaluations and discuss the challenges for HRI posed by the sources of the negative evaluations: (1) designing a robot to adapt to the many routines the participants use at home, (2) unique needs of participants with PD not present in student participants, and (3) the role of familiar technologies in designing and evaluating a new technology. While it is unlikely, given the current state of technology, that fully autonomous assistive robots for older adults will be available in the near term, we believe that our work exposes a critical need in HRI to involve the target population as early as possible in the design process.},

We develop a teacher-teleoperated robot and tablet system, as well as learning activities, to help teach facial emotions to minimally verbal autistic children. We then conduct user studies with 31 UK and Serbia minimally verbal autistic children to evaluate the system's accessibility. Results showed minimally verbal autistic children could use the tablet interface to control or respond to a humanoid robot and could understand the face learning activities. We found that a flexible and powerful wizard-of-oz tablet interface respected the needs of the children and their teachers. Our work suggests that a non-participatory, user-centered design process can create a robot and tablet system that is accessible to many autistic children.},

We argue that creative interaction can be usefully viewed in terms of Productive Interaction - focused engagement on the development of a creative outcome, Structural Interaction - the development of the structures in which production occurs, and Longitudinal Interaction - the long-term development of resources and relationships that increase creative potential. An analysis of each perspective is described, along with the development of an exemplary prototype. The use of the perspectives as a basis for design is considered, including the influence of contextual factors on instances of creative activities.},

We broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. We conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the United States. While the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussions about racial injustice and economic inequality. In addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product.},

From this perspective, less attention has yet been paid to imprisoned persons. Many penitentiary systems are formally characterized by the basic requirement of resocialization. Accordingly, life in prison should be largely adapted to conditions outside and to fundamental social changes, which must be considered in designing the framework for prison systems. Still, the digital opening of the prison is debated controversially, not least due to anticipated security issues. Hence, to raise awareness about challenges for digital participation of prisoners, we conducted a knowledge-sociological analysis (SKAD) of the public discourse on the use of ICT by prison inmates in Germany. We thereby seek to advance knowledge and insights from social and organizational practice arising from the use of ICT in context of total institutions and create the basis for action from a socio-informatics perspective.},

Recommendations are based on findings from a media study focusing on how people currently use their IPTV systems and associated devices in their homes. The media study applied an ethnographic oriented method called playful probing. From the user's perspective the ideal smart phone application provides them on a general level with a simplified set of (touch-enabled) buttons to control and navigate. The application should support them in their most frequent tasks (e.g. watching TV, listening to music) and overall shall enhance the experience by providing additional information to the TV channel currently selected, by supporting their need for privacy and by allowing them to achieve a certain level of security. In terms of interaction techniques, users prefer flexible touch interaction and (a limited set of) speech commands over gesture, with the exception of being able to directly point at a device to identify it for direct control.},

abstract = {Learning activities use an increasing number of software tools. These mediate the interactions among participants and of these with resources like documents and tools. These tools constitute a valuable source of information about the actual learning processes. However, this use faces multiple problems. Lecturers need to gain expertise on the data each tool provides and how to analyse them, each tool only offers a partial view of the process, students have different profiles and use different tools, and time to make analyses is limited. To address this situation, this work proposes the use of Assistants for Learning Activities (ALAs), i.e. semi-automated tools that use social knowledge to integrate different sources of information and interpret their data. This knowledge is extracted from literature on learning, and specified as social properties. These properties describe patterns that appear in information and their interpretation in terms of the learning-related activities. Their specification relies on a specific modelling language oriented to social activities and their context. It is designed to facilitate communication with the target learning communities. Wrappers for software tools get the raw data, transform them into facts for this language, and assert them in an information base. Then, a pattern matching algorithm finds instances of the social properties among these facts, giving an interpretation of the original data. A case study on teamwork in a project-based learning context of a university using several software tools illustrates the approach. It shows the feasibility of adapting the analysis through the modification of the considered properties, and how these can explain the observed data.},

abstract = {The content of this handbook would be most appropriate for graduate students, and of primary interest to students studying computer science and information technology, human-computer interfaces, mobile and ubiquitous interfaces, and related multidisciplinary majors. When teaching graduate classes with this book, whether in quarter or semester classes, we recommend initially requiring that students spend two weeks reading the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces (Morgan Claypool, Human-Centered Interfaces Synthesis Series, 2015). This textbook is suitable for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students. With this orientation, a graduate class providing an overview of multimodal-multisensor interfaces then could select chapters from the handbook distributed across topics in the different sections.As an example, in a 10-week quarter course the remaining 8 weeks might be allocated to reading select chapters on: (1) theory, user modeling, common modality combinations (2 weeks); (2) prototyping and software tools, signal processing and architectures (2 weeks); (3) language and dialogue processing (1 week); (4) detection of emotional and cognitive state (2 weeks); and (5) commercialization, future trends, and societal issues (1 week). In a more extended 16-week semester class, we would recommend spending an additional week reading and discussing chapters on each of these five topic areas, as well as an additional week on the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces. As an alternative, in a semester course in which students will be conducting a project in one target area (e.g., designing multimodal dialogue systems for in-vehicle use), some or all of the additional time in the semester course could be spent: (1) reading a more in-depth collection of handbook chapters on language and dialogue processing (e.g., 2 weeks) and (2) conducting the hands-on project (e.g., 4 weeks).For more tailored versions of a course on multimodal-multisensor interfaces, another approach would be to have students read the handbook chapters in relevant sections, and then follow up with more targeted and in-depth technical papers. For example, a course intended for a cognitive science audience might start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters from the handbook sections on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations; (2) multimodal processing of social and emotional information; and (3) multimodal processing of cognition and mental health status. Afterward, the course could teach students different computational and statistical analysis techniques related to these chapters, ideally through demonstration. Students then might be asked to conduct a hands-on project in which they apply one or more analysis methods to multimodal data to build user models or predict mental states. As a second example, a course intended for a computer science audience might also start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters on: (1) prototyping and software tools; (2) multimodal signal processing and architectures; and (3) language and dialogue processing. Afterward, students might engage in a hands-on project in which they design, build, and evaluate the performance of a multimodal system.In all of these teaching scenarios, we anticipate that professors will find this handbook to be a particularly comprehensive and valuable current resource for teaching about multimodal-multisensor interfaces.},

The model with seven phases is a generalization of common process models in computing. Gender/diversity expertise has been condensed into a number of aspects that characterize the social context of computing research. They can be related to and reflected during every phase. This reflection is somewhat operationalized by providing a list of questions for each combination of phase and aspect. Case studies as part of the model illustrate either in what way such reflections may help in research and development or what may happen if no such aspects have been included.},

The health domain presents additional barriers including access to patients and concerns about exposing personal health information. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, it describes an interface designed to augment the ability of clinicians to efficiently engage in high-quality and empathetic health counseling dialog with their patients. Second, it presents a WOZ protocol for collecting this dialog using standardized patient actors each playing a role from a pool of caregiver personas.},

abstract = {Today's teens will most likely be the first generation to spend a lifetime living and interacting with both mechanical and social robots. Although human-robot interaction has been explored in children, adults, and seniors, examination of teen-robot interaction has been minimal. Using human-centered design, our team is developing a social robot to gather stress and mood data from teens in a public high school. As part of our preliminary design stage, we conducted a interaction pilot study in the wild to explore and capture teens' initial interactions with a low-fidelity social robot prototype. We observed strong engagement and expressions of empathy from teens during our qualitative, interaction studies.},

abstract = {Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-to-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.},

abstract = {Industry demand for software developers with knowledge of accessibility has increased substantially in recent years. However, there is little knowledge about the prevalence of higher education teaching about accessibility or faculty's perceived barriers to teaching accessibility. To address this gap, we surveyed 14,176 computing and information science faculty in the United States. We received a representative sample of at least one response from 318 of the 352 institutions we surveyed, totaling 1,857 responses. We found that 175 institutions (50%) had at least one instructor teaching accessibility and that no fewer than 2.5% of faculty overall teach accessibility. Faculty that teach accessibility are twice as likely to be female, to have expertise in HCI and software engineering, and to know people with disabilities. The most critical barriers to teaching accessibility that faculty reported were the absence of clear and discipline-specific accessibility learning objectives and the lack of faculty knowledge about accessibility. Faculty desired resources that were specific to the areas of computing in which they teach rather than general accessibility resources and guidelines.},

A 3rd-space, portable and modular design is described and demonstrated for use in administering and supporting learning in 3D. 3rd-space environments can be designed for enabling multi-purpose, multifunctional devices and tools for learner-centered design and collaborative social learning. The framework offered in this paper supports multiple delivery options involving offline and online access to an OpenSim platform for learning in 3D and the use of Drupal modules for administering and supporting collaborative peer-based social learning. The architecture is demonstrated in two learning in 3D prototypes: a 4-H regional youth leadership robotics project involving a collaborative model-based reasoning simulation game on geothermal energy and a lesson on the early history of the U.

We focus our discussion on four types of tensions that we encountered: motivations; accountability; participation, and; qualifying success. We believe that the tensions we encountered in our projects, and that we discuss in this paper, might be experienced similarly by other early career researchers. By sharing our tensions, raising our questions, and proposing some preliminary answers to those questions based on our experiences and reflections, we hope to provoke a discussion amongst our dg.o peers that will lead to improved future collaborations, a supportive community environment and, ultimately, smoother Smart City research projects.},

These methods reflect experience and insights gained from previous INL experiments that have focused on landmine detection and marking; mapping and localization for robot positioning, mobile manipulation for explosive ordinance disposal (EOD), radiation characterization, and urban search and rescue operations. An overarching goal of this work has been to enhance our understanding of how the robot, the control and display interface, the task context, and the human contribute to or hinder mission success. Our approach to performance measurement was developed in concert with the iterative design cycle of our intelligent robotic control system, the robot intelligence kernel (RIK). In extending and refining the RIK for various applications, three factors key to holistic human-robot performance assessment were identified: comprehensive planning; the inclusion of end users in the design and performance evaluation phases of the study; and combining automated data collection with subjective measures. The paper discusses lessons learned in developing and applying performance metrics and provides a brief overview of measures that we are currently using to support the assessment of autonomy. In particular, the paper emphasizes the application of these metrics to behaviors for complex and potentially dangerous missions.},

The conclusion from studies illustrate that the complex nature of professional practice in the high risk settings has significant influences upon the fitness for purpose.

The question is, why? To answer this, we consider three questions and then turn to the nature of answer which might lead towards greater adoption. The first is the vexed question of how good is good enough? The second concerns how best modeling should link through to decision-making; and the third concerns the culture needed to make the most of modeling and simulation (and whether it is worth the effort to make the transformation). From these, we draw an agenda for further enquiry in terms of stakeholders, their culture, data, and expectations, and the case in terms of value.},

abstract = {For years the development of software artifacts was the sole domain of developers and project managers. However, experience has taught us that the users play a very important role in software development and construction. The inclusion of the Domain Experts directly in the development cycle is a very important characteristic of Domain-Specific Languages, as they have often an important role in making and constraining the domain of the language.DSLs are credited with increased productivity and ease of use, but this fact is hardly ever proven. Moreover, Usability tests are frequently only performed at the final stages of the project when changes have a significant impact on the budget. To help prevent this, in this paper we present a pattern language for evaluating the usability of DSLs. These patterns can help show how to use an iterative usability validation development strategy to produce DSLs that can achieve a high degree of Usability.},

Few games and apps promoting physical activity for people with IDs exist, and they do not have a focus on the motivational aspect. This paper aims to find how to develop software that can motivate people with IDs to do physical activity outdoors. For this purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not attract much of the users' attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors propose a web-based 3D room layout system supporting the user preferences. To simulate the furniture and office layout, 3D layout systems are commonly used. However, generating 3D room layouts is a very time-consuming task because it needs complicated manual operations and much technical knowledge. Therefore, we need any tools that help us to easily generate 3D room layouts. The authors have been developing a 3D room layout system that has the following features:1. Analysis of user preference (Conjoint analysis).2. Optimization of 3D room layouts based on Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC).Although IEC is useful for applying the user preferences to the solution, there is a problem about the tiredness of user evaluation operations of IEC process because of the large search space of solutions. To cope with this problem, the authors adopted a prediction method for shrinking the search space and employed a multiscreen interface for reducing the tiredness of each user. In this paper, the authors also justify the usefulness of the system from the experimental results.},

They have been described using an instrument specifically created for collecting information about each element of the framework. The proposed framework is composed by the most influential factors/aspects of public service delivery. It has been used for analyzing and comparing the three countries public service delivery. Based on that, some findings and translation to policy recommendations have been done. The paper ends up with a set of policy recommendations on how public services can be improved in different country contexts.},

abstract = {There has been an increase in the study of discrete simulation projects; however, literature lacks the topic of effectively managing these projects. Therefore, in this research, some principles from project management were applied in a discrete event simulation project. The action research method was used to implement the study. The ten knowledge areas from PMBOK®'s (2013) project management theory were applied to a simulation project, and a management plan was summarized for each area. Using a management plan to conduct the simulation has shown to be effective. Through organization and preparation, we have reduced risk, increased communication, developed two add-on packages for web information systems to manage the communication, effectively utilized resources, and most importantly, established clear project goals and deliverables. The simulation project is still in progress, therefore more comprehensive results are expected at project completion.},

abstract = {We deployed an autonomous social robotic learning com- panion in three preschool classrooms at an American public school for two months. Before and after this deployment, we asked the teachers and teaching assistants who worked in the classrooms about their views on the use of social robots in preschool education. We found that teachers' expectations about the experience of having a robot in their classrooms often did not match up with their actual experience. These teachers generally expected the robot to be disruptive, but found that it was not, and furthermore, had numerous positive ideas about the robot's potential as a new educational tool for their classrooms. Based on these interviews, we provide a summary of lessons we learned about running child-robot interaction studies in preschools. We share some advice for future researchers who may wish to engage teachers and schools in the course of their own human-robot interaction work. Understanding the teachers, the classroom environment, and the constraints involved is especially important for microgenetic and longitudinal studies, which require more of the school's time-as well as more of the researchers' time-and is a greater opportunity investment for everyone involved.},

We describe a three-dimensional characterization space for software components along with its implementation in a component-based platform for rapidly developing multimodal interfaces. By graphically assembling components, the designer/developer describes the transformation chain from physical devices to tasks and vice-versa. In this context, the key point is to identify generic components that can be reused for different multimodal applications. Nevertheless for flexibility purposes, a mixed approach that enables the designer to use both generic components and tailored components is required. As a consequence, our characterization space includes one axis dedicated to the reusability aspect of a component. The two other axes of our characterization space, respectively depict the role of the component in the data-flow from devices to tasks and the level of specification of the component. We illustrate our three dimensional characterization space as well as the implemented tool based on it using a multimodal map navigator.},

Information and Communication Technologies have emerged as key drivers in the redefinition of the city mechanism and its relationship with citizens. In the newest paradigms, cities constitute an environment for implementing innovative actions and promoting the contribution of many stakeholders. Several studies have analysed and assessed the "smart city" as an ecosystem with focus on challenges, performance indicators, and barriers; or have proposed taxonomies for its evaluation and frameworks for its definition. But not much has been done for classifying possible smart cities implementations. The aim of this study is to review and categorise the smart cities developments in the municipality operational areas, to map the implemented initiatives and to propose a living taxonomy of smart cities possible actions. The suggested taxonomy consists of ten primary areas and 85 developments. This study is a first attempt to introduce a comprehensive taxonomy in order to support decision-makers planning the future of their cities as well as to serve as a reference model for the communication among the actors of the quadruple helix towards next developments prioritization.},

abstract = {Background: Requirement engineering is often considered a critical activity in system development projects. The increasing complexity of software as well as number and heterogeneity of stakeholders motivate the development of methods and tools for improving large-scale requirement engineering. Aims: The empirical study presented in this paper aim to identify and understand the characteristics and challenges of a platform, as desired by experts, to support requirement engineering for individual stakeholders, based on the current pain-points of their organizations when dealing with a large number requirements. Method: We conducted a multiple case study with three companies in different domains. We collected data through ten semi-structured interviews with experts from these companies. Results: The main pain-point for stakeholders is handling the vast amount of data from different sources. The foreseen platform should leverage such data to manage changes in requirements according to customers' and users' preferences. It should also offer stakeholders an estimation of how long a requirements engineering task will take to complete, along with an easier requirements dependency identification and requirements reuse strategy. Conclusions: The findings provide empirical evidence about how practitioners wish to improve their requirement engineering processes and tools. The insights are a starting point for in-depth investigations into the problems and solutions presented. Practitioners can use the results to improve existing or design new practices and tools.},

abstract = {There is an increasing demand toward an innovative knowledge-intensive service industry in global business. In particular, the soaring research area of service science, management, and engineering (SSME) emphasizes how people and technology can be effectively aligned to achieve value co-creation between service providers and customers through systematic service innovation. In order to address the problem of the systematic service innovation, this study proposes a machine-metaphor and adaption-metaphor approach to constructing collaborative service system (CSS) which can automate value co-creation experiences using facilitating (or assisting, mediating) the service operation management and improve service productivity and satisfaction. This machine-metaphor approach comprises two parts: simple service machine (SSM) and intelligent service machine (ISM), in which the notion of machines aims at significantly effectuates the productivity in the emergent service/experience economy. In this study, we develop a CSS application: iInteriorDesign that illustrates how a CSS application of innovative knowledge-intensive interior design service can be developed using SSM and ISM. Due to the requirements with massive communications to assure the customers' needs in the interior design service, iInteriorDesign use adaption-metaphor (co-evolutionary technology) to provide the effective decision support on the extraction of the significant interior-design attributes (e.g., romantic, luxurious, etc.) and the optimization of the interior-design concept style selection (e.g., victorian style, minimal &amp; luxury etc.) with a concept style ontology (of the concept style properties like Region, Era, Category, Climate, and Culture) within the interior design services. iInteriorDesign provides a platform that the service participants joint efforts to determine the ideal concept styles of interior design to meet the customer's needs over Internet.Further, the study adopts the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) to evidence if the symbiotic interdependence relationship building can expedite the value co-creation. This study also proposes 'Symbiotic Service Model' based on the RDT to contribute the service innovation research.},

Apart from the pressure to deliver better services from constrained resources, the increasing use of metrics to monitor and manage care delivery, also means that service providers require a clearer idea of how a service improvement will perform prior to implementation. In turn, this opens up an opportunity for a much greater use of simulation and modeling techniques, provided they can be set within an appropriate framework. This paper discusses and describes a research project aimed at conducting pilot work for developing a framework that facilitates joined up thinking and enables integrative modeling. An approach to achieving such an end is described and progress to date is reported. Since this is an ongoing project, some of the latest results are presented at the conference.},

abstract = {The benefits of exploiting multi-modality in the analysis of human-human social behaviour has been demonstrated widely in the community. An important aspect of this problem is the collection of data-sets that provide a rich and realistic representation of how people actually socialize with each other in real life. These subtle coordination patterns are influenced by individual beliefs, goals, and, desires related to what an individual stands to lose or gain in the activities they perform in their every day life. These conditions cannot be easily replicated in a lab setting and require a radical re-thinking of both how and what to collect. This tutorial provides a guide on how to create such multi-modal multi-sensor data sets when holistically considering the entire experimental design and data collection process.},

abstract = {Collaborative virtual and augmented reality are an active area of research and many systems supporting collaboration have been presented. Just like there are many different systems for VR and AR, there are many different types of collaboration. In some cases, virtual reality is used to enhance an existing collaborative process. In other cases, it enables new types of collaboration that previously were not possible (e.g. distributed VR). Other systems support tasks that can be performed either individually as well as collaboratively. While these tasks may allow to be performed collaboratively, little has been said on what the benefit is in doing so. We present a user study of a collaborative construction task in a shared physical workspace virtual reality environment under various degrees of interaction in collaboration. Our results show that, for this type of task, a pair of subjects concurrently interacting can be significantly more effective, even though individual user performance decreases. Our results further show that there is no significant benefit in giving only verbal and non-verbal assistance over a single user performing the task.},

abstract = {Cyberspaces require both the implementation of customized functional requirements and the enforcement of policy constraints to be trustworthy. In tailored, distributed and adaptive environments (spaces), monitoring to ensure this enforcement is especially difficult given the wide spectrum of activities performed and the evolving range of threats. Spaces must be monitored from a multitude of perspectives, each of which will generate a vast quantity of disparate information, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. However, existing security toolsets and offerings are not yet well equipped to analyze these kinds of data with the necessary speed and agility. Big Data technologies, such as Hadoop, enable the analysis of large and unstructured data sources. We propose security operations teams extend their existing security infrastructure with emerging Big Data analytics and Complex Event Processing platforms. To help them do so, we introduce a conceptual blueprint for the analytics solution. We also present an Orchestrated Analytical Security operational and organizational framework that helps organizations understand how analytical security not only provides monitoring but also creates actionable intelligence from data.},

We use the Story Completion Method(SCM) to explore commonplace assumptions around futures with sex robots and discuss those from a critical design perspective. Thirty five participants completed a story stem of a human encountering a sex robot or vice-versa. Through thematic analysis, we show narratives of consumerist relation-ships between humans and sex robots, stories that describe sex robots as highly-efficient sex workers that (out)perform humans in routinal sex activities, and narratives that explore sex robots as empathetic and sentient beings. Our participant-created stories both reinforce and challenge established norms of sex robots and raise questions that concern responsible design and ethics in HCI. Finally, we show opportunities and limitations of using multiple-perspective story stems in SCM},

In order to reflect on the future of workplaces, we created fictional job postings for the context of production facilities. This context is characterized by many constraints, which are often hard to overcome when envisioning the future of interactive practices in such environments. With the fictional job postings, we triggered discussions with stakeholders from a production site and with the public -- which both resulted in highly controversial debates. In this note, we present the evolution of an exemplary job posting and the reactions it evoked. We then discuss our learnings (e.g., that the degree of fiction is essential) and conclude by reflecting on how this instrument facilitates the exploration of prospective interactive practices at work.},

abstract = {The timely identification of deficiencies in cognitive functions, such as attention problems, are of vital importance for children to acquire skills such as literacy. However, today, the application of psychometric tests for the identification of attention problems takes place when children already have symptoms, or problems associated with the development of their learning. So, an early detection in the preschool age is of vital importance for their optimal development. The use of serious games and interactive interfaces for the detection and therapy of problems related to learning has helped to obtain better results according to the studies analyzed in the related work. In this work we propose proposed to identify deficiencies in cognitive functions for preschool children, using a serious game and a control interface that provides a natural interaction. Following the first stages of the experimental research methodology, the methodology of soft systems, the incremental model of software development and the rapid contextual design technique, a prototype of interactive interface was obtained and the proposal of a serious game with the necessary characteristics for performing tests to detect deficiencies in cognitive functions.},

The experience evaluation was based upon the case-study of an interactive artwork entitled GEO Landscapes .01 -- a gallery installation prototype which commenced development in 2006 and was exhibited in a public space in 2007. The experience evaluation study demonstrated how the novice versus expert profiles of interaction behaviours influenced the nature of the artwork experience. The research findings improved our understanding of how people experience artworks and also had an impact on the experience design of GEO Landscapes and the future direction of the project.},

It exposes to the end users modern Web-based tools relying on a sophisticated infrastructure to collect, enrich, annotate, and search through large document corpora. Supporting researchers in their daily work is a novel concern for infrastructures. We describe how we gathered requirements through multiple methods to understand historians’ needs and derive an abstract workflow to support them. We then outline the tools that we have built, tying their technical descriptions to the user requirements. The main tools are the note-taking environment and its faceted search capabilities; the data integration platform including the Data API, supporting semantic enrichment through entity recognition; and the environment supporting the software development processes throughout the project to keep both technical partners and researchers in the loop. The outcomes are technical together with new resources developed and gathered, and the research workflow that has been described and documented.},

We present a design fiction in which a BCI technology creates a new type of menial labor, using workers' unconscious reactions to assist algorithms in performing a sorting task. We describe how such a scenario could unfold through multiple sites of interaction: the design of an API, a programmer's question on StackOverflow, an internal memo from a dating company, and a set of forum posts about laborers' experience using the designed system. Through these fictions, we deepen and expand conversations around what kinds of (everyday) futures BCIs could create.},

In this paper, we take stock of 18 years of CCI research by conducting a systematic literature study exploring how and to what extent ethics has been dealt with in the community's leading venues: the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference and the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI). Searching all papers in the IDC conference proceedings and IJCCI, 157 papers were found that use the word stem 'ethic*'. Based on our analysis of these papers, our study demonstrates that while ethics is frequently mentioned, the literature remains underdeveloped in a number of areas including definition and theoretical basis, the reporting of formal ethical approval procedures, and the extent to which design and participation ethics is dealt with. Based on our study we provide five avenues of future research in the interests of developing a more explicit discourse on ethics in CCI.},

To build high quality ontologies, developers are required to choose and follow a suitable methodology containing a series of steps, activities and guidelines organized in a systematic way. In this paper, we develop guidelines on how to select ontology merging or integration which has not been explored in any ontology research. As it is more cost effective to build an ontology reusing existing ontologies (integration and merging) than from scratch, we therefore propose an ontology development methodology, MIOD, which incorporates and performs ontology integration in its development process. A semi-automatic key term evaluation system is developed to find suitable source ontologies from a group of candidate ontologies. The proposed methodology and system are used to address the insufficiency of current ontology development and integration methodologies.},

abstract = {Contributing to a growing attention to algorithms and algorithmic interaction in the CHI and CSCW communities, this workshop aims to deal centrally with the topic of human "participation" and its changing role to data-driven, algorithmic ecosystems. Such a focus includes projects that involve users in the design of algorithms and "human-in-the-loop" systems, broader investigations into the ways in which "participation" is situated in data-driven activities, as well as conceptual concerns about participation's changing contours in contemporary social computing landscapes. This one- day workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers and sets out to achieve three goals: identify cases and ongoing projects on the topic of participation in algorithmic ecosystems; create a tactical toolkit of key challenges and strategies in this space; and set a forward-facing agenda to provoke further attention to the changing role of participation in contemporary sociotechnical systems.},

We survey exploratory interaction design techniques for human vehicle interactions, showing examples from our research of each technique in action. The techniques are enactments, contextual inquiry, scale scenarios, Wizard of Oz, field experiments and video and animation prototyping. We reflect upon our experiences with these methods, and discuss as yet unmet needs in interaction design for the road ahead.},

Patterns have had significant impact in a wide array of disciplines, particularly software engineering, and we believe that they provide a powerful lens for looking at visualization evaluation by offering practical, tried-and-tested tips and tricks that can be adopted immediately. The 12 patterns presented here have also been added to a freely editable Wiki repository. The motivation for creating this evaluation pattern language is to (a) disseminate hard-won experience on visualization evaluation to researchers and practitioners alike; to (b) provide a standardized vocabulary for designing visualization evaluation; and to (c) invite the community to add new evaluation patterns to a growing repository of patterns.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce Mokap, a novel authoring and development toolset for serious games. Mokap aims to address two specific challenges: provide support for early development stage design and facilitate involvement of domain experts. More specifically, on the one hand, it aims to make serious game authoring possible for people with no technical background. On the other hand, Mokap provides explicit support for activities related to analysis and design, especially useful during the early stages of development. In this sense, Mokap aims to facilitate the transition from the designers' board to the programmers' environment and also to enhance communication between the different roles of the development team. Developed as an open source environment, Mokap is oriented to mobile devices (tablets and smartphones), a kind of technology most educational stakeholders are familiar with. We present the main design concepts behind Mokap, along with some technical insight into the platform and the description of the game Listen With Lemur as a case study.},

The rise of large scale labor analytics raises questions about how and whether workers could use such data to advocate for their own goals. Here, we analyze the historical development of workplace technology design methods in CSCW to show how mid-20th century labor responses to scientific management can inform directions in contemporary digital labor advocacy. First, we demonstrate how specific methodological tendencies from industrial scientific management were adapted to work in CSCW, and then subsequently altered in crowd work and social computing research to more closely resemble industrial approaches. Next, we show how three tactics used by labor unions to strategically engage with industrial scientific management in the mid-20th century can inform data-driven worker advocacy in platform-mediated work. Finally, we discuss how this history shapes our understanding of worker participation and the implications of using worker data for contemporary advocacy goals.},

The ANU Computer Science Internship Program is innovative in its design, as it provides three streams: (1) placement in a host organisation, (2) an academic project-based program, and (3) professional mentoring and support via workshops and peer circles. Students entering internship placements find themselves challenged by leaving the university to engage in work-integrated learning, and even more so if they are international students encountering foreign workplace culture. We support our students in managing and growing through these challenges by providing a supportive network, both academically and professionally.

These audio-kinetic graphics can be played back using off-the-shelf computer hardware.

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the preservation of original semantic similarity among objects when dimensional reduction is applied on the original data source and a further clustering process is performed on dimensionally reduced data. An experiment is designed to test Baire, or longest common prefix ultrametric, and K-Means when prior random projection is applied. A data matrix extracted from a cultural heritage database has been prepared for the experiment. Given that the random projection produces a vector with components ranging on the interval [0, 1], clusters are obtained at different precision levels. Next, the mean semantic similarity of clusters is calculated using a modified version of the Jaccard index. Our findings show that semantics is difficult to preserve by these methods. However, a Student's hypothesis test on mean similarity indicates that Baire clusters objects are semantically better than K-Means when we increase the digit precision, but paying an increasing cost for orphan clustered objects. Despite this cost, it is argued that the ultrametric technique provides an efficient process to detect semantic homogeneity on the original data space.},

This research project pursues to what extent this process can be technically supported or improved. In the first step, user-centered and participative methods were used to identify the problems together with first-year students, and an onboarding concept was developed. In the second step, the concept was technically implemented and evaluated with quantitative and qualitative research methods. 102 freshmen participated in the following chatbot-based onboarding scavenger hunt, which had a strong focus on network building between the new students. The 12-day onboarding scavenger hunt was conducted at the beginning of the winter semester 2019 with computer science freshmen at the University of Vienna. The evaluation results revealed that the students felt more familiar with the faculty building and the university campus after the scavenger hunt, also met other students, made new friends, and, by participating, their sense of belonging to the student community became stronger.},

Digital games are increasingly prevalent in today's classrooms, and game-based learning is emerging as a successful means of reaching students who often struggle to succeed through more traditional approaches. For example, students with autism face a unique set of challenges and goals in the context of classroom learning. Principles of well-designed games offer a powerful framework for designing new types of learning experiences for students with autism. Moreover, recent innovations in computing interfaces have also lead to new forms of socio-collaborative experiences with digital media. This article introduces our recent case study in applying game-based learning in Special Education. We will present the learning scenario goals and implementation, focusing on how this work successfully applied well-designed game principles to this context.

abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing trend in which data scientists and domain experts work together to tackle complex scientific questions. However, such collaborations often face challenges. In this paper, we aim to decipher this collaboration complexity through a semi-structured interview study with 22 interviewees from teams of bio-medical scientists collaborating with data scientists. In the analysis, we adopt the Olsons' four-dimensions framework proposed in Distance Matters to code interview transcripts. Our findings suggest that besides the glitches in the collaboration readiness, technology readiness, and coupling of work dimensions, the tensions that exist in the common ground building process influence the collaboration outcomes, and then persist in the actual collaboration process. In contrast to prior works' general account of building a high level of common ground, the breakdowns of content common ground together with the strengthen of process common ground in this process is more beneficial for scientific discovery. We discuss why that is and what the design suggestions are, and conclude the paper with future directions and limitations.},

This one-day workshop will explore how to go beyond technologies that narrowly focus on concepts of assistance or intervention. We specifically ask a) how autism is conceptualised as a disability and how this impacts on possible roles of technologies, b) how to unlock novel design spaces methodologically and c) how to evaluate the experiences of people with autism with technology. As an outcome, we will collaboratively develop a manifesto to draw attention to the gap we have identified and develop a research agenda to address it.},

Computer scientists are challenged to manage increasingly large datasets while developing analytic and visualisation tools. Ecologists struggle to find and use tools that answer highly heterogeneous research questions. These two fields are naturally drawn together at the tool interface, however, less attention has been paid to how their practices influence tool design and use. We interviewed and collected email correspondence from four computer scientists and eight ecologists to learn how their practices indicate opportunities for reconciling difference through design. We found that different temporal rhythms, relationships to data, and data-driven questions demand tool configuration, data integration, and standardisation. This research outlines interfacing opportunities for new ecological research utilising large acoustic datasets, and also contributes to evolving HCI approaches in areas making use of big data and human-in-the-loop processes.},

abstract = {Significant work in the CHI community has focused on designing systems that support human values. Designers and engineers have also become increasingly aware of ways in which the artifacts they create can embody political, social, and ethical values. Despite such an awareness, there has been little work towards producing practical methodologies that systematically incorporate values into the design process. Many designers struggle to find a balance between their own values, those of users and other stakeholders, and those of the surrounding culture. In this paper, we present the RAPUNSEL project as a case study of game design in a values-rich context and describe our efforts toward navigating the complexities this entails. Additionally, we present initial steps toward the development of a systematic methodology for discovery, analysis, and integration of values in technology design in the hope that others may both benefit from and build upon this work.},

Designers first analyze their own scenarios or storyboards with respect to concrete examples drawn from five socio-technical principles: situated action, rhythms &amp; routines, co-adaptive systems, peripheral awareness and distributed cognition. They then walk through the scenario and brainstorm new design alternatives that reflect the design principle in question. This combination of structured walkthroughs with focused brainstorming helps designers, particularly those with little social science background, to generate concrete, actionable ideas that reflect key findings from the social science literature. We taught Generative Walkthroughs in ten courses with over 220 students and found that technically-trained students not only learned these socio-technical principles, but were able to apply them in innovative ways in a variety of design settings.},

In doing so they reconfigure the relationship ethnography has to systems design, replacing detailed empirical studies of situated action with studies that provide cultural interpretations of action and critiques of the design process itself. We hold these new approaches to and understandings of ethnography in design up to scrutiny, with the purpose of enabling designers to appreciate the differences between new and existing approaches to ethnography in systems design and the practical implications this might have for design.},

A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.},

abstract = {Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the "Ostrom Workshop." A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a "constitutional layer" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.},

This paper presents an aviation domain ontology, the ICARUS ontology, which aims at facilitating the semantic description and integration of information resources that represent the various assets of the ICARUS platform and their use. To present the functionality and usability of the proposed ontology, we present the results of querying the ontology using SPARQL queries through three use case scenarios. As shown from the evaluation, the ICARUS ontology enables the integration and reasoning over multiple sources of heterogeneous aviation-related data, the semantic description of metadata produced by ICARUS, and their storage in a knowledge-base which is dynamically updated and provides access to its contents via SPARQL queries.},

We present our first iteration of a human-centered design process for creating Tadpole, an interactive digital media experience designed for students with behavioral disorders. This platform enables students and their guardians to interact with and monitor their behavioral progress in the classroom through data driven incentives in the form of interactive visuals and avatar features. As a second iteration design, we present our research proposal to involve students with behavioral disorders in the design process.

In turn, gamification has been identified as a useful tool to motivate individuals towards behavioural change. However, both health professionals and game developers are currently working on island solutions addressing individual problems due to the lack of efficient frameworks enabling cooperation in this domain. This has resulted in a large number of mHealth apps, each using different motivational techniques, metrics and health data. In this paper we propose a unified user-centred framework which is capable of running third-party developer's apps within a sandbox. Using this approach, we can mitigate often voiced privacy and safety concerns and simultaneously tailor health-interventions using content from developers as well as user preferences and environment in order to facilitate internalisation of healthy lifestyles. Apart from this, we provide indications for operationalizing our conceptual framework in future work.},

abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease often experience freezing of gait, which bears a high risk of falling, a prevalent cause for morbidity and mortality. In this work we present GaitAssist, a wearable system for freezing of gait support in daily life. The system provides real-time auditory cueing after the onset of freezing episodes. Furthermore, GaitAssist implements training exercises to learn how to handle freezing situations. GaitAssist is the result of a design process where we considered the input of engineers, clinicians and 18 Parkinson's disease patients, in order to find an optimal trade-off between system wearability and performance. We tested the final system in a user study with 5 additional patients. They reported a reduction in the freezing of gait duration as a result of the auditory stimulation provided, and that they feel the system enhanced their confidence during walking.},

abstract = {Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into the workplace, impacting organizational structures and processes, and affecting products and services created by these organizations. While robots promise significant benefits to organizations, their introduction poses a variety of design challenges. In this paper, we use ethnographic data collected at a hospital using an autonomous delivery robot to examine how organizational factors affect the way its members respond to robots and the changes engendered by their use. Our analysis uncovered dramatic differences between the medical and post-partum units in how people integrated the robot into their workflow and their perceptions of and interactions with it. Different patient profiles in these units led to differences in workflow, goals, social dynamics, and the use of the physical environment. In medical units, low tolerance for interruptions, a discrepancy between the perceived cost and benefits of using the robot, and breakdowns due to high traffic and clutter in the robot's path caused the robot to have a negative impact on the workflow and staff resistance. On the contrary, post-partum units integrated the robot into their workflow and social context. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines for the development of robots for organizations.},

Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. We discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. We conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small.},

abstract = {Wicked problems are immensely complex problems that do not lend themselves to resolution through traditional problem-solving approaches. This capriciousness is particularly troublesome for organizations that encounter such problems due to their very nature being highly prone to fluctuation. Further, any attempts to resolve wicked problems tend to be irreversible --- for better or for worse. Decision support systems (DSSs) have long been hailed as a panacea of sorts for highly complex problems due to their ability to assist in storing, retrieving, and manipulating information to arrive at a decision. However, traditional DSSs, being originally aimed at semi-structured problems, are rendered almost ineffectual in the face of the high levels of complexity inherent in wicked problems. Consequently, this paper outlines the argument that posits procedural rationality as an alternative underlying mechanism for developing DSSs for wicked problems. An empirical literature review is utilized to locate the required characteristics of such a DSS, to evaluate cognizance thereof in the research, and to present an integrated model for the design, development, and utilisation of procedural DSSs specifically for resolution of wicked problems.},

Although Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) communities have shown a growing interest in researching issues around civic technologies, yet most research still focuses on projects from the Global North. The goal of this workshop is, therefore, to advance CSCW research by raising awareness for the ongoing challenges and open questions around civic technology by bridging the gap between researchers and practitioners from different regions.The workshop will be organized around three central topics: (1) discuss how the local context and infrastructure affect the design, implementation, adoption, and maintenance of civic technology; (2) identify key elements of the configuration of trust among government, citizenry, and local organizations and how these elements change depending on the sociopolitical context where community engagement takes place; (3) discover what methods and strategies are best suited for conducting research on civic technologies in different contexts. These core topics will be covered across sessions that will initiate in-depth discussions and, thereby, stimulate collaboration between the CSCW research community and practitioners of civic technologies from both Global North and South.},

abstract = {HCI has long considered sites of workplace collaboration. From airline cockpits to distributed groupware systems, scholars emphasize the importance of supporting a multitude of tasks and creating technologies that integrate into collaborative work settings. More recent scholarship highlights a growing need to consider the concerns of workers within and beyond established workplace settings or roles of employment, from steelworkers whose jobs have been eliminated with post-industrial shifts in the economy to contractors performing the content moderation that shapes our social media experiences. This one-day workshop seeks to bring together a growing community of HCI scholars concerned with the labor upon which the future of work we envision relies. We will discuss existing methods for studying work that we find both productive and problematic, with the aim of understanding how we might better bridge current gaps in research, policy, and practice. Such conversations will focus on the challenges associated with taking a worker-oriented approach and outline concrete methods and strategies for conducting research on labor in changing industrial, political, and environmental contexts.},

abstract = {This paper presents ACKTUS, a semantic web platform for modeling and managing knowledge integrated in support systems for health care, and for designing the interaction with the end user applications. A key purpose is to allow the domain experts to collaboratively model the knowledge content and tailor interaction to users. Therefore, the development has been done in a process of participatory action research where domain experts have contributed to the design and re-design of ACKTUS while they have been modeling the content and behavior of end-user applications. The ontology that serves as the knowledge structure in the system integrates the user model, modality values, clinical practice guidelines and preferences, in the form of schemes and scheme-nodes (arguments) in an argumentation framework, partly by integrating the argument interchange format. User studies have shown that ACKTUS can be used for the intended purpose by domain professionals not familiar with knowledge engineering tasks. Moreover, the platform functions as a research infrastructure for health researchers in their development and evaluation of new ICT-based interventions targeting improved health.},

The dance production process is a creative process in which exploration and expression are paramount and we describe issues we have observed over four different dance production cycles. The Choreographer's Notebook addresses the recurring problem of scarcity of rehearsal time and space, which is a limiting factor for exploration and expression. The tool is a web-based video application that enables choreographers to provide multimodal, context-sensitive instructions and feedback to the dancers outside of formal rehearsal time. The novelty of this tool is its ability to provide a multimodal collaborative video-based workflow. This article also presents a thorough ethnographic investigation of the dance production process and results from the use of the Choreographer's Notebook as an artifact within that process.},

Large rural constituencies, encompassing vast and sparsely populated areas, lack broadband connectivity and rely predominantly on volunteer-based emergency workforce. The above are some of the key factors hampering rural first responders? ability to access, act upon and disseminate emergency-related information. This has an adverse effect on both residents and the agencies that serve them, as it limits residents? ability to prepare for emergencies and compromises the safety of first responders. Furthermore, the unique socio-economic structure of rural areas makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of incipient or unfolding disasters. Hence, rural communities often develop self-reliance capabilities by creating tightknit social structures and taking charge of their own technological progress through community-driven efforts.},

abstract = {Software Design Patterns (SDPs) are core solutions to the recurring problems in software. However, adopting SDPs without taking into account their value implications may result in breach of social values and ultimately lead to user dissatisfaction, lack of adoption, and financial loss. An example is the airline system that overcharged people who were trying to escape from the Hurricane Irma. Although not intentional, overlsight of social values in the design of the airline system resulted in significant customer dissatisfaction and loss of trust. To mitigate such value breaches in software design we propose taking social values into account in SDPs explicitly. To achieve this, we outline a collaborative framework that allows for (i) specifying the value implications of SDPs, (ii) developing or extending SDPs for integrating social values, (iii) providing guidance on the value-conscious adoption of design patterns, (iv) collecting and analyzing insights from collaborators, (v) maintaining an up-to-date library of the valufied design patterns, and (vi) incorporating lessons learned from the real-world adoption of the valuefied design patterns into the proposed framework for its continuous improvement in integrating social values into software.},

abstract = {Engineering software-intensive systems is a complex process that typically involves making many critical decisions. A continuous challenge during system design, analysis and development is deciding on the reference architecture that could reduce risks and deliver the expected functionality and quality of a product or a service to its users. The lack of evidence in documenting strategies supporting decision-making in the selection of architectural assets in systems and software engineering creates an impediment in learning, improving and also reducing the risks involved. In order to fill this gap, ten experienced researchers in the field of decision support for the selection of architectural assets in engineering software-intensive systems conducted a workshop to reduce traceability of strategies and define a dedicated taxonomy. The result was the GRADE taxonomy, whose key elements can be used to support decision-making as exemplified through a real case instantiation for validation purposes. The overall aim is to support future work of researchers and practitioners in decision-making in the context of architectural assets in the development of software-intensive systems. The taxonomy may be used in three ways: (i) identify new opportunities in structuring decisions; (ii) support the review of alternatives and enable informed decisions; and (iii) evaluate decisions by describing in a retrospective fashion decisions, factors impacting the decision and the outcome.},

abstract = {Personas help in understanding the users' needs. However, their descriptions usually contain too many details related to personal characteristics and too little information relevant to the software that will be developed. This may limit their use and acceptance. In this context, the PATHY technique was proposed. It uses guiding questions to create personas more focused on the design of applications. In this paper, we present an experimental study where the technique was integrated with user stories. The study aims at evaluating the participants' perception regarding the structure of the technique and analyzing the requirements generated when using PATHY in a software development process. The results showed that, although the participants found some difficulties, they considered the technique useful for creating personas. Furthermore, it helped in the identification of requirements used as basis for the elaboration of user stories.},

Conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.},

To accomplish this, design in digital civics emphasizes the importance of relationships based on dialogue, empowerment, and participation; all of which are contingent upon the existence of trust. Currently, however, these relationships are most often characterized by entrenched distrust which problematizes opportunities for dialogue and participation. In this paper, we explore how design might support trust in the relational aims of digital civics. To do so, we led 13 public officials in a large US city through a design-based inquiry centered around the role of trust in their various efforts to engage communities. In our findings, we discuss four strategies for supporting trust in digital civics.},

abstract = {Project schedule delay is a major problem in many projects. It has major consequences and effects on project cost, customer satisfaction level, market share and company reputation. Schedule delay factors can be expressed as direct or indirect causes of schedule delay. Developing an acquisition frame to study schedule delay is a need for any analytic process and there was no such generic model developed to analyze many projects at once regardless of their uniqueness. (Data Acquisition Model) DAM is the way which includes schedule delay factors selected from academic and practical field experience. DAM grouped schedule delay factors according to project life cycle level. EPC lifecycle is known as (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) phases of project life cycle. Some factors were not related to EPC, so adding a criteria using (general) was informative to group non-EPC factors. Shortlisting schedule delay factors in each group was achieved through another criteria (selection criteria). As a conclusion based on the literature review and our practical experience the model might be novel to address schedule delay problem in projects. Data mining techniques have been widely utilized in many industries to extract hidden descriptive or implicit knowledge. A framework was developed based on two main models (hybrid KDD Model) and (Fayyad Model) to discover knowledge in data. DAM might be starting point for (DM) techniques; to generate knowledge about schedule delay factors that will help many decision makers to take corrective action items and control schedule delays in projects.},

This inhibits the students' ability to understand social, technical and ethical issues in context, or to develop affective relationships with users and other stakeholders. To address this, we designed a service learning course that partnered students with non-profit organizations to help with their technology challenges. The service project was deliberately left open-ended to force students (and partners) to tackle important questions around project scoping and impact. By drawing parallels to soil care practices, we explore how "care time" emerged in this context, and how the incorporation of ambiguity galvanized students, community, and faculty to make time to navigate it. This led to non-tangible yet vital outcomes such as overcoming social limitations, building symbiotic relationships, and enacting acts of care necessary for more ethical orchestration of technology.},

abstract = {Media Architecture is reaching a level of maturity at which we can identify tools and approaches for addressing the main challenges for HCI practitioners working in this field. While previous influential contributions within Media Architecture have identified challenges for designers and offered case studies of specific approaches, here, we (1) provide guidance on how to tackle the domain-specific challenges of Media Architecture design -- pertaining to the interface, integration, content, context, process, prototyping, and evaluation -- on the basis of the development of numerous installations over the course of seven years, and thorough studies of related work, and (2) present five categories of tools and approaches -- software tools, projection, 3D models, hardware prototyping, and evaluation tools -- developed to address these challenges in practice, exemplified through six concrete examples from real-life cases.},

To assist designers in the design process of on-body companion robots, we surveyed users' expectations towards on-body companion robots (n=215) by a questionnaire constituting of questions on factors that may affect robot acceptance, including robot functionality, robot appearance, and robot social ability. Based on the survey results, we stated design guidelines for the design of on-body companion robots supporting designers with insights into users. To demonstrate how to design on-body companion robots based on our findings, we organized a workshop with experienced designers to develop a conceptual on-body companion robot, and they proposed Bubo, an example prototype of on-body companion robot.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering is one of the most critical phases in the context of software development. Unclear textual specifications of requirements, hidden dependencies between requirements, and suboptimal prioritizations and release plans represent the major reasons for project delays and even cancellation. In this paper, we show how group recommender user interfaces can help to improve the quality of requirements engineering processes. To that end, we developed a novel group recommendation approach that focuses on the aspect of improving requirements prioritization by making preference elicitation processes more flexible as well as by introducing innovative user interfaces that foster information exchange among stakeholders. We conducted a large user study (N=313 participants) to evaluate our approach. The evaluation results indicate that argumentation-based user interfaces in a group setting trigger more rating and communication activity among the group members which significantly improves the quality of the prioritization process. Our main contributions are twofold: (1) more flexibility of the requirements evaluation by supporting the delegation of votes to experts and (2) an increased engagement of the stakeholders responsible for the requirements.},

This paper contributes a set of concepts, tactics, and novel design forms for addressing network anxieties generated through a design-led inquiry, or research through design approach. We present three technically grounded metaphors illustrated with examples selected from our exploratory design process. Weaving together concepts from surveillance studies, cultural studies, and other areas of the humanities with our visual and physical design work, we help draw attention to under-addressed concerns within HCI while proposing alternative ways of framing and engaging design issues arising with network technologies.},

abstract = {George Santayana's statement, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," is only half true. The past also includes successful histories. If you haven't been made aware of them, you're often condemned not to repeat their successes.In a rapidly expanding field such as software engineering, this happens a lot. Extensive studies of many software projects such as the Standish Reports offer convincing evidence that many projects fail to repeat past successes.This paper tries to identify at least some of the major past software experiences that were well worth repeating, and some that were not. It also tries to identify underlying phenomena influencing the evolution of software engineering practices that have at least helped the author appreciate how our field has gotten to where it has been and where it is.A counterpart Santayana-like statement about the past and future might say, "In an era of rapid change, those who repeat the past are condemned to a bleak future." (Think about the dinosaurs, and think carefully about software engineering maturity models that emphasize repeatability.)This paper also tries to identify some of the major sources of change that will affect software engineering practices in the next couple of decades, and identifies some strategies for assessing and adapting to these sources of change. It also makes some first steps towards distinguishing relatively timeless software engineering principles that are risky not to repeat, and conditions of change under which aging practices will become increasingly risky to repeat.},

We define Fab Form as any design representation that lends itself to interactive customization by a novice user, while remaining valid and manufacturable. We propose a method to achieve these Fab Form requirements for general parametric designs tagged with a general set of automated validity tests and a small number of parameters exposed to the casual user. Our solution separates Fab Form evaluation into a precomputation stage and a runtime stage. Parts of the geometry and design validity (such as manufacturability) are evaluated and stored in the precomputation stage by adaptively sampling the design space. At runtime the remainder of the evaluation is performed. This allows interactive navigation in the valid regions of the design space using an automatically generated Web user interface (UI). We evaluate our approach by converting several parametric models into corresponding Fab Forms.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a coordinated push for automation in Smart Factories and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The increasing complexity of frequently changing production environments challenges shop floor workers to perform well. The tasks they work on are getting less routine and ask for continuous knowledge and skills development. For example, the skills portfolio of workers likely requires improved higher-order thinking and decision-making skills. A wide range of research and development efforts already today sets focus on different areas of workplace learning, including performance appraisals, pedagogy and education, technology, and business economics. Bridging the skills gap, however, requires novel user-facing technologies -- such as Augmented Reality (AR) and wearables -- for human performance augmentation to improve efficiency and effectiveness of staff delivered through live guidance. AR branches out beyond mobile apps with 3D-object superimposition for marketing purposes to rather complex use cases delivered by a rapidly growing innovation ecosystem of hard- and software providers collaborating closely with R&amp;D organisations. This paper provides a first shared vision on how AR can tackle four different challenges related to handling complexity in a CPS environment: develop intelligent assistance systems for learning and performance assessment at the workplace, adapt job profiles accordingly, and last but not least to address also the issue of work-life balance. The paper concludes with an outline of a research roadmap.},

We believe an in-depth analysis of the task involving experts and users is needed to build a new generation of NSS focusing on man-machine collaboration. We describe a scenario-based approach to gathering requirements for such a system. We wrote five scenarios containing part of the envisioned functionality in the most important use situations, e.g. face-to-face negotiation, on the phone, collaborative or mobile preparation. We used claims analysis to clarify our design decisions. To evaluate our claims we organized focus groups including six general and six job negotiation experts. The filmed scenarios were used together with two claims each to guide the discussion. Based on the data analysis we constructed 12 design guidelines for NSS.},

As a result of such policies, Korea has demonstrated excellent results in the United Nation's e-government survey, ITU's ICT development index, and OECD's public data openness index. Paradoxically, however, this history and experience is a stumbling block to a new era. PSI, which is a basic resource for realizing the value of openness, sharing, cooperation, and communication, should be actively managed and opened by government to provide support for reuse in the sense that the government is its main producer and manager. However, no matter how good the quality of PSI through data management is and how excellent policies and institutions are established, if the private sector cannot actively use it, it is useless. What is the role of government and law in the context of changing the way data is managed and blurring sectoral boundaries?This paper aims to propose core challenges by analyzing the case of Korea in order to derive a basis for discussions to coordinate public and private cooperation and legal relations in the process. To begin with, we analyze the changes in the management environment of data and PSI and identify the role of government and law in responding to changes in the legal rights. Then, we discuss how Korea responds to change, examines related policies by function and discussions on the data law, which seem to have the greatest effect on government's role, and suggests essential tasks to change its role accordingly.},

We propose data edibilization, i.e., encoding data with edible materials, as a novel approach to leverage multiple sensory channels to convey data stories. We conduct a preliminary data tasting workshop to explore how users interact with and interpret data edibilization. Based on the participants' feedback, we summarize the advantages of edibilization in terms of attractiveness, richness, memorability, affectiveness, and sociability. We also identify several challenges with data edibilization. We discuss possible pragmatic processes, enabling technologies, and potential research opportunities to provide insights into the design space of data edibilization and its practicality.},

Despite their prevalence, the design of VAs and their embeddedness with other personal technologies and daily routines have yet to be studied in detail. Making use of a roundtable, we will discuss these issues by providing a number of VA use scenarios that panel members will discuss. Some of the issues that researchers will discuss in this panel include: (1) obtaining VA data &amp; privacy concerns around the processing and storage of user data; (2) the personalization of VAs and the user value derived from this interaction; and (3) the relevant UX work that reflects on the design of VAs?},

We describe how the worker population has changed over time, shifting from a primarily moderate-income, U.S.-based workforce towards an increasingly international group with a significant population of young, well-educated Indian workers. This change in population points to how workers may treat Turking as a full-time job, which they rely on to make ends meet.},

Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.},

abstract = {The potential for integration of digital games and learning becomes ever more significant recently. One of the goals in educational game design is to create engaging and immersive learning experiences for delivering specified learning goals, outcomes and experiences. However, there is limited number of research done on game usability or quality of game user interface. Failure to design usable game interfaces can interfere with the larger goal of creating a compelling experience for users and can have a negative effect on the overall quality and success of a game. In this paper, we review usability problems identified by previous researchers and propose a history educational game design which includes pedagogical and game design component. Some snapshots of our game module are also presented. Finally we present a usability evaluation method for history educational game design. From our critical literature reviews, we also proposed six constructs which are interface, mechanics, gameplay, playability, feedback and immersion for usability evaluation.},

abstract = {Physical computing is a complex activity that consists of different but tightly coupled tasks: programming and assembling hardware for circuits. Prior work clearly shows that this coupling is the main source of mistakes that unfruitfully take a large portion of novices' debugging time. While past work presented systems that simplify prototyping or introduce novel debugging functionalities, these tools either limit what users can accomplish or are too complex for beginners. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose prototyping tool based on conversation. HeyTeddy guides users during hardware assembly by providing additional information on requests or by interactively presenting the assembly steps to build a circuit. Furthermore, the user can program and execute code in real-time on their Arduino platform without having to write any code, but instead by using commands triggered by voice or text via chat. Finally, the system also presents a set of test capabilities for enhancing debugging with custom and proactive unit tests. We codesigned the system with 10 users over 6 months and tested it with realistic physical computing tasks. With the result of two user studies, we show that conversational programming is feasible and that voice is a suitable alternative for programming simple logic and encouraging exploration. We also demonstrate that conversational programming with unit tests is effective in reducing development time and overall debugging problems while increasing users' confidence. Finally, we highlight limitations and future avenues of research.},

abstract = {We present a novel display metaphor which extends traditional tabletop projections in collaborative environments by introducing freeform, environment-aware display representations and a matching set of interaction schemes. For that purpose, we map personalized widgets or ordinary computer applications that have been designed for a conventional, rectangular layout into space-efficient bubbles whose warping is performed with a potential-based physics approach. With a set of interaction operators based on laser pointer tracking, these freeform displays can be transformed and elastically deformed using focus and context visualization techniques. We also provide operations for intuitive instantiation of bubbles, cloning, cut &amp; pasting, deletion and grouping in an interactive way, and we allow for user-drawn annotations and text entry using a projected keyboard. Additionally, an optional environment-aware adaptivity of the displays is achieved by imperceptible, realtime scanning of the projection geometry. Subsequently, collision-responses of the bubbles with non-optimal surface parts are computed in a rigid body simulation. The extraction of the projection surface properties runs concurrently with the main application of the system. Our approach is entirely based on off the-shelf, low-cost hardware including DLP-projectors and FireWire cameras.},

The associated research highlights how IoT is influencing changes and requirements in communication required to facilitate decision making between systems, devices and people in a connected world. The paper provides background context on the development of IoT technologies and how these developments overlap with industry, enabling revolutionary changes such as Industry 4.0 and the advent of the Industrial Internet. The emergence of IoT technologies, IoT enabled industry and IoT influenced social change are discussed, highlighting the new requirements and production demands that are emerging for integrated communications, features and systems.The paper introduces a new end-to-end and framework for enterprise planning, adoption and deployment of a feature rich and integrated Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) system within a multinational enterprise. The new framework presents a multi-domain structure with four primary modular containers. This structured model introduces new concepts of a Core Governance Domain (CGD), Operational Management Domain (OMD), Unified Services Domain (USD) and Integrated Feature Domain (IFD). Combined these domains represent a coherent framework that supports initial deployment and planning, ongoing sustain and technical agile technical architecture.

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many people; the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 59 children are currently identified with ASD in the United States. Although it is difficult to generalize about people with ASD due to their heterogeneity, many share an affinity for technologies; as such, numerous academic endeavors and commercial products have focused on the creation of interactive technologies for ASD. In this article, we present findings from 19 interviews and 230 surveys with parents, teachers, and therapists who had children with ASD in their care and had considered or used interactive technologies with those children. We aimed to understand how interactive technologies were used, perceived, desired, and discovered. Findings of use and perception included the following: participants had tried a wide range of commercially available technologies but had very few reported products in common, products were limited to commercial mobile-based apps, and apps were typically perceived positively. In regard to desires, participants hoped for future technologies on diverse platforms (e.g., robots, virtual reality) with more consideration given to personalization, customization, and incorporation of audio and video. Findings about discovery included the following: participants chose technologies in an information-poor environment, and although there are many academic projects aimed at participants’ desires, no participants reported any experience working with researchers. Implications of this study include the need for a recommendation and information sharing system to help people choose and discover appropriate and effective interactive technologies that are a good fit for their child. This work also pointed to a need for such a system to include findings from lab (experimental and usability) studies of commercially available interactive technologies to provide measures of efficacy and usability. Our envisioned system could also potentially help academic researchers with outreach to wider audiences.},

The study covered the steps of design, development and deployment of an application for live video broadcasting. Over a 10 months period, professional responders has used the application in over 200 incidents. The study shows how short video sequences are produced as an embedded activity in order to capture small fragments of work rather than creating a complete coverage of an incident. Further, this study also shows how broadcasted video is incorporated into the work at the command center as visual reports, which open up for collective negotiations of the broader meaning of a situation.},

abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often focuses on how designers can develop systems that convey a single, specific, clear interpretation of what they are for and how they should be used and experienced. New domains such as domestic and public environments, new influences from the arts and humanities, and new techniques in HCI itself are converging to suggest that multiple, potentially competing interpretations can fruitfully co-exist. In this paper, we lay out the contours of the new space opened by a focus on multiple interpretations, which may more fully address the complexity, dynamics and interplay of user, system, and designer interpretation. We document how design and evaluation strategies shift when we abandon the presumption that a specific, authoritative interpretation of the systems we build is necessary, possible or desirable.},

abstract = {Healthcare is an information and knowledge intensive industry where software systems are playing increasingly important roles. Thus the risks of harm are increasing. Previously, we have proposed a knowledge translation (KT) model to help bridge the gap between software engineering and clinicians. This paper highlights the application of our proposed knowledge translation loop. We have enacted it through a series of two studies: 1. A randomized control trial to evaluate a software-based decision support function in an electronic medical record (EMR) and 2. A lead user based user interface and safety design study to create an improved design for an EMR medication module. We also provide lessons learned and future directions on integrating our KT model in regular software quality management systems.},

abstract = {Social learning analytics are concerned with the process of knowledge construction as learners build knowledge together in their social and cultural environments. One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses interactive technologies in the service of seniors. Adults over 65 form one of the largest and most rapidly growing user groups in the industrialized society. Interactive technologies have been steadily improving in their ability to provide practical support for these users and their daily challenges. These applications range from supporting low-literacy adults with mobile touch and spoken language interfaces [Munteanu et al. 2014], to interactive robotic fitness coaches for seniors [G\"{o}rer et al. 2016]. The goal of this chapter is to present an in-depth analysis of the needs of seniors, as well as to investigate how multimodal and multisensor technologies are used to address these needs.In Section 8.2 of this chapter, we structure the needs of older adults according to a hierarchy of human needs that emphasizes self-actualization [Maslow 1954]. Maslow's theoretical prism helps us to identify a broad spectrum of potential opportunities for researchers and practitioners who design multimodal-multisensor applications. We present a number of example applications in Section 8.3. These examples are illustrative of how interactive technologies, especially ones that leverage multiple modalities (e.g., speech, gestures, touch) and sensor data (e.g., location and accelerometers available on consumer phones) can provide a basis for meeting the needs of older adults. Section 8.4 briefly surveys future directions of multimodal-multisensor research that has potential for developing valuable new 320 Chapter 8 Multimodal Technologies for Seniors: Challenges and Opportunities assistive living technologies.1 Section 8.5 is a discussion of both design and implementation challenges, followed with conclusions in Section 8.6, and a list of supplementary Focus Questions to aid in further understanding of essential content.

On top of that, the increasing interest in incorporating user feedback into product development keeps pushing the limit of resources that UX research teams can allocate. Is this seemingly unstoppable appetite for user insights sustainable? How can UX researchers properly support their product teams' growing needs? We argue that, to be successful at scaling up Lean UX research, product teams need to become active actors in the process, while researchers need to use their expertise to provide guidance and training as required. As an example of this approach, we describe our experience organizing "Developer Day", a yearly event aimed at scaling up the Lean UX research practices of Microsoft's Developer Division. Developer Day has also extended the reach of the division's UX Research team for impacting decisions about the company's software developer tools and services.},

There are big opportunities in the domain Aerospace &amp; Aviation at the same time. As the core software of the aero engine control unit, FADEC software is a kind of safety critical software which the processes of its development must do the compliance of RTCA DO-178C [1], and cost-effective of its development is a grand challenge.Information technology provides a new method for impoving the efficiency of safety critical software[2].Through information technology, some tasks of software development were automatically run by machines, such as source code building, static analysis and unit test of source code and so on.Because of the particularly of FADEC software, all run tasks needs to meet strict process specifications in order to ensure high guality of software[3]. Meanwhile, the construction of information has invested huge costs to ensure the stability and reliability of the environment which was depended by autorun tasks.As an information-based builder of software engineering, we need to be able to master the effectiveness of information technology to software development.This paper introduces a method to measure information technology effect based on data classification, collection and visualization.

abstract = {User Interface (UI) design has been a core topic of HCI research for several decades. Equipped with design skills and knowledge, the expert interface designer meticulously analyses a design brief, conceptualises design ideas, and constructs viable solutions. The intended outcome of this tedious process is a usable and aesthetically-pleasing UI. Classical approaches in HCI have relied upon providing designers with guidelines, heuristics, and best practices for realising good designs. In recent years, computational approaches have turned towards formalising and automating parts of the design process. In this provocation, I claim that the future expert will hand over the task of creating design solutions entirely to the machine, and instead take on the role of an interface curator who inspects a set of feasible designs and picks out the best possible solutions for a given problem. I discuss the current state of computational interface design, and suggest a path forward towards realising this vision.},

abstract = {As the average overall life expectancy for individuals in the U.S. continues to increase along with the aging baby boomers, so too does the need for accessible healthcare solutions. It is reported that aging is one of the greatest known risk factors for the onset of cognitive impairment (CI), such as Alzheimer's disease. For individuals with more severe forms of CI, the inability to effectively perform mental tasks required for independent daily living can severely limit one's functionality. Traditional solutions for early detection of cognitive decline and impairment can be inaccessible, expensive, and time consuming. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop a dynamic online computerized neuropsychological testing system capable of rapidly tracking an individual's cognitive performance throughout the user's daily or weekly schedule in a way that is the least intrusive. By utilizing embedded microsensors within tablet devices, the proposed system will capture ambient and behavioral data pertinent to the real-world contexts and times of testing. Such sensor data has the potential to compliment psychometric results by providing insight into the contextual factors relevant to the user's testing efficacy and performance. In addition, the investigation into the accessibility issues faced by older adults will lead to improved neuropsychological testing interfaces.},

Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.},

In doing so, these technologies subtly dictate the forms of knowledge and types of relationships menstruators are expected to establish with their bodies (i.e., transactional or instrumentalized). Through historical analysis and a series of participatory experiments, we offer a vision for menstrual sensemaking that expands on these forms of interaction and ways of knowing to emphasize multiplicity and dimensionality rather than models, predictability, or a user's relation to averages or norms.},

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.},

To this end, we ran a focus group with ten dancers with expertise in technology. We analysed the focus group using thematic analysis. We discuss the implications for design of our results by framing the role of technology in dance performance, proposing design guidelines related to the communication to the audience, use of technology, and mapping. Moreover, we propose different levels of ambiguity and appropriation related to the creators of the performance and the audience.},

abstract = {The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.},

abstract = {Motivated by the uniqueness of the African culture we took an intellectual trip through some topical HCI discourses in order to highlight areas amenable to flexible abstractions using Agent-based modeling/Multi agent systems (ABM/MAS). We identified issues arising from "Social computing" in Embodied Interaction and "Reassessing culture difference" in Postcolonial Computing; these underpinned the framework of our analyses. Above all, we highlight the relationship between agent technology and HCI areas; and present a summary of how it has been applied and where it can be applied in African contexts as well as the benefits of its application. The usefulness of this study is depicted in its ability to illuminate the relationship between HCI and ABM/MAS and to explicitly show what can be possibly achieved using the agent modeling approach. It is our hope that the application of ABM/MAS would stimulate rich theoretical (and intellectual) discussions that further HCI development in Africa.},

This paper describes a novel cell phone application that uses information about one's social network and the places one frequents to suggest the names of individuals one might plausibly encounter in a particular place. We anticipate that this "names prosthesis" will help senior citizens to improve socialization, functional memory and levels of autonomy.

The game structure includes, word puzzles, levels, body states, goals and game skills. Body states are body movements and positions that players must discover in order to complete a level and in turn represent a learned game skill. The paper provides an overview of background concepts and related research. We describe the prototype and game structure, provide a technical description of the prototype and discuss technical issues related to sensing, reasoning and display. The paper contributes by providing a method for constructing group parameters from individual parameters with real-time motion capture data; and a model for mapping the trajectory of participant's actions in order to determine an intensity level used to manage the experience flow of the game and its representation in audio and visual display. We conclude with a discussion of known and outstanding technical issues, and future research.},

abstract = {There have been several attempts to support political engagement through novel social media services. While the political nature of any technologies is widely acknowledged in human-computer interaction, such considerations have been less studied when designing for political engagement in social media services. We used speculative design probes to gauge how political elites perceive alternative social media interfaces designed to increase media diversity and decrease political polarisation. We show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. Based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. Our underlying contribution is wider. We show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. Second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. Finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. Therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media.},

At the core of the project is the intention to explore absurd making as a way to support critical and disruptive design practices. We reflect on how surreal, nonsensical and fragile artefacts can be helpful to stretch and critique conventional ideas of what is useful and appropriate in technology research and development. After introducing both concepts and methods that shaped the event we present a selection of useless interfaces designed by the hackathon's attendees. These musical artefacts, and the considerations around them, are then discussed as a viable means for communicating both design concerns and future visions. We also consider two features identified as playing a crucial role within the event: the discovery of contradictions and the importance of context-based ingredients.},

To address the challenges of self-management of mental illnesses, we have developed the MONARCA system - a personal monitoring system for bipolar patients. We conducted a 14 week field trial in which 12 patients used the system, and we report findings focusing on their experiences. The results were positive; compared to using paper-based forms, the adherence to self-assessment improved; the system was considered very easy to use; and the perceived usefulness of the system was high. Based on this study, the paper discusses three HCI questions related to the design of personal health technologies; how to design for disease awareness and self-treatment, how to ensure adherence to personal health technologies, and the roles of different types of technology platforms.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel user interface and system for exploring extremely detailed 3D models in a museum setting. Three-dimensional models and associated information are presented on a large projection surface controlled by a touch-enabled surface placed at a suitable distance in front of it. Our indirect user interface, dubbed IsoCam, combines an object-aware interactive camera controller with an interactive point-of-interest selector and is implemented within a scalable implementation based on multiresolution structures shared between the rendering and user interaction subsystems. The collision-free camera controller automatically supports the smooth transition from orbiting to proximal navigation, by exploiting a distance-field representation of the 3D object. The point-of-interest selector exploits a specialized view similarity computation to propose a few nearby easily reachable interesting 3D views from a large database, move the camera to the user-selected point of interest, and provide extra information through overlaid annotations of the target view. The capabilities of our approach have been demonstrated in a public event attended by thousands of people, which were offered the possibility to explore submillimetric reconstructions of 38 stone statues of the Mont’e Prama Nuragic complex, depicting larger-than-life human figures, and small models of prehistoric Nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers). A follow-up of this work, using 2.5m-high projection screens, is now included in permanent exhibitions at two Archeological Museums. Results of a thorough user evaluation, involving quantitative and subjective measurements, are discussed.},

abstract = {Children's play objects are increasingly shaped by technological innovations that can transform them into hybrid, internet-connected toys, a phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Toys. Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R&amp;D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking, crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists' and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices.},

Missing is the perspective of older adults on the ethics of and potential uses for robotic companion pets. In this study, we conducted focus groups with 41 older adults.

To successfully integrate this work within the HCI community, critically oriented researchers have tactically engaged with dominant practices within HCI in the design and evaluation of their work. This paper draws attention to the ways that tactical engagement with aspects of HCI evaluation methodology shapes and bears consequences for critically oriented research. We reflect on three of our own experiences evaluating critically oriented designs and trace challenges that we faced to the ways that sensibilities about generalizable knowledge are manifested in HCI evaluation methodology. Drawing from our own experiences, as well as other influential critically oriented design projects in HCI, we articulate some of the trade-offs involved in consciously adopting or not adopting certain normative aspects of HCI evaluation. We argue that some forms of this engagement can hamstring researchers from pursuing their intended research goals and have consequences beyond specific research projects to affect the normative discourse in the field as a whole.},

To address this research gap, this study investigates the overall presence, nature, and frequency of referrals of 18 popular science fiction robots in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library. These robots were either portrayed in various movies and subsequently inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame, created by Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, or were top-ranked in a user-curated Internet Movie Database (IMDB) list. To do so, we performed full-text search and retrieval queries of all 18 robots in the ACM Digital Library. In total, we identified 121 relevant mentions, across 102 individual publications, in a time span from 1973 to 2017. These 121 mentions were then qualitatively analysed to determine the nature of the robot mentions. Our results indicate that the robot attributes of voice or dialogue were emerging as a popularly mentioned element. In addition, we find that research papers of philosophical nature mention sci-fi robots more frequently than papers of technical or theoretical nature. We also observe that the dystopian element of science fiction is under-utilised, with the majority of robot mentions exhibiting neutral or utopian characteristics. In conclusion, we speculate on our results and present possible avenues of future HRI research on the topic.},

abstract = {Australia has a rich array of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, but they face decline along with many valued aspects of culture unless they are passed down to, and used by, younger generations. Prior work on designing technologies for language learning has often taken particular language skills, learning theories, and technologies as their starting point. Our empirical work with a remote Aboriginal community illustrates four ways in which this community's language practices intersect with family relations and are deeply enmeshed with family histories and stories, Indigenous Knowledges, and activities on and about country. Thus, we argue for a relational approach that instead takes family communication and social activities as the basis for designing technologies that foster everyday language use. We outline the guiding principles of this design orientation, and illustrate how they have been taken up in the co-design of a talking soft toy called the 'Crocodile Language Friend.' Finally, we identify opportunities and open issues in taking a relational approach to designing technologies for language communities with similar needs and aspirations.},

Hyperion is able to retrieve text content from users' current view and deliver the content to them in different ways according to their context. We design four work modalities for different situations that mobile users encounter in their daily activities. In addition, user interaction interfaces are provided to adapt to different application scenarios. Although Google Glass may be constrained by its poor computational capabilities and its limited battery capacity, we utilize code-level offloading to companion mobile devices to improve the runtime performance and the sustainability of WAR applications. System experiments show that Hyperion improves users ability to be aware of text information around them. Our prototype indicates promising potential of converging WAR technology and wearable devices such as Google Glass to improve people's daily activities.},

EAST is an intermediary interactive tablet based app that assists in the early-detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by screening preschoolers in Pakistan through play-based activities in a home, school or clinical setting. Medical professionals, parents of autistic children and teachers were surveyed through focus groups to understand the reasons that contribute to the increasing number of missed early detections, and late- or misdiagnoses. We also evaluate the acceptability, usability and validity of our tool. We tested EAST with both typically developed and autistic children on how they relate to people, imitation, motor skills, visual and intellectual response. They were scored via time taken, the number of wrong attempts, or incorrect answers and audiovisual feedback. This paper contributes towards a digital autism screening tool that delivers insights into the child's behaviour and enables collaboration among parents, teachers and medical professionals.},

Public scholarship can result in positive outcomes, such as community engagement, accessible research, and self-promotion. Further, public scholarship can support ethical research as a way to (1) reconnect with participants after data collection; and (2) increase the societal benefit of the research. However, despite these benefits there are also challenges and risks associated with engaging in public scholarship, particularly for early career researchers and those who are marginalized. This workshop will bring together those who already engage or are interested in this practice to discuss how to integrate public scholarship in our work, identify best practices for this type of work in the context of CSCW, including the ethical implications of outreach, and develop strategies to effectively support those most affected by the potential risks.},

This paper presents a first attempt at formalizing the digital gap created by the generalization of search engines. This was achieved through the development of a mapping of cognitive abilities required by users to execute low-level tasks during a standard Web search task. The mapping demonstrates how critical these abilities are to successfully use search engines with an adequate level of independence. It will lead to a set of design guidelines for search engine interfaces that will allow for the engagement of users of all abilities, and also, more importantly, in search algorithms such as query suggestion and measure of relevance (i.e. ranking).},

Within Computer Science and Engineering, research investigates how to track PA of older adults for various purposes. We present a systematic review of 204 papers and discuss wearable tracking systems according to their purpose, technological context, and target audience, as well as design and evaluation processes with particular attention to the meaningful involvement of older adults. Our results show that most systems focus on supervising older adults in the context of disease and frailty management. Only few systems focus on supporting older adults by promoting rehabilitation and respecting agency of older adults via self-monitoring PA, or encouraging PA to maintain healthy levels of activity. Moreover, systems are often narrowly limited to walking, although older adults may enjoy a broader range of activities. Likewise, the involvement of older adults in design processes is scarce, and their experience with a given technology is rarely considered relevant for evaluation. In sum, we contribute an overview of wearable technology for tracking older adults’ PA, contextualize our findings within recommendations provided by Sports and Rehabilitation Science, and illustrate opportunities for future work.},

The main motivation of the course updates was to cover the educational needs of software engineering students, which are not the same as HCI or design students. Software engineering students learned better and became more engaged with the topic of accessibility when it was tied to programming and development- based activities. The final form of the course was evaluated using a survey, and the results showed that students found the course beneficial to their education and relevant to their career. We discuss the challenges of creating, teaching, and maintaining a course on accessibility, and we offer insights on what research is needed in this area to support accessibility educators.},

The research focus within these labs ranged from computational biology to applied molecular biology and biochemistry. The findings indicate that colleagues play a significant role in information seeking activities, but there is need for better methods of capturing and retaining information from them during development. Also, in terms of online information sources, there is need for more centralization, improved access and organization of resources, and more consistency among formats. More broadly, the findings illustrate a variety of information problems that end-user biologists and professional software developers face in developing bioinformatics software and how they are influenced by the level of domain knowledge and technical expertise.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.   This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area.    Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors.    These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}

We also find that most evaluations do not focus on reflection per se rather but on some other outcome arguably linked to reflection. Our review also describes the relationship between reflection and persuasion evidenced implicitly by both rhetorical motivations for and implementation details of system design.

Through this paper the framework is developed, justified and explained. The framework is then demonstrated using three cases. Since the conception of CTP in the late 1990s it has attracted interest from various areas, and through research is helping to yield new ways forward for problem areas, design and products in HCI. However the application of CTP has always been up to individuals and their own interpretation. The proposed framework tries to add structure through a series of easy to follow steps that the CTP adopter can use to apply CTP to their problem area, design or product. The framework is motivated by the need to provide the adopter with a straight forward way to critically think about his/her HCI arena. Ways to enable this are provided and areas for future work are discussed. The use cases presented help to demonstrate how the framework can be applied to each of these different areas.},

In this paper we describe CueS, a wrist worn cueing device which prompts the wearer to move their upper limb more frequently in their day to day lives. We conducted two, week-long 'in the wild' deployments of CueS with seven participants to obtain reflections and experiences around using the device. All participants reported increased general activity levels from wearing CueS and objective data showed increased levels of activity following cue provision. We reflect upon the potential of wearable cueing devices for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke.},

Using RFID-based paper mechanisms, IoT Stickers integrates common sensors and web services with interactive stickers through a trigger-action architecture. This integration enables computational services to be tailored to everyday activities by setting parameters to be passed to the sticker's actions and composing the stickers together.

We present an analytic lens which divides visualisations into three categories: journalistic, scientific and critical visualisations. We then present a case study that uses these three categories of visualisations to further support information security practice.Two significant results emerge from this case study: (1) visualisations that promote critical thinking and reflection (a form of critical visualisation) support the multi-stakeholder nature of risk assessment and (2) a preparatory stage in risk assessment is sometimes needed by service designers in order to establish the service design before conducting a formal risk assessment.The reader is invited to explore the images in the digital version of this paper where they can zoom in to particular aspects of the images and view the images in colour.},

abstract = {More and more cities aim to solve their urban challenges by implementing various smart city initiatives. Involving citizens in the design of these projects has proven to be an essential precondition for a successful outcome. Therefore, citizen participation in the context of smart cities has gained a considerable attention by researchers and practitioners. However, participation can be instrumental to solely gain a smart label and must thus be carefully evaluated. Several evaluation frameworks, largely based on the seminal work of Arnstein's Ladder in 1969, have been developed over the years but can be oversimplified, too strict or not fit for a smart city context.Following design science research, this paper develops a holistic framework to evaluate participation in smart cities by bundling several established evaluation scales from the scientific literature. By means of this framework, it is possible to evaluate to what extent smart city initiatives are citizen-oriented. Then, the framework is applied to the cities of Dublin and London. In order to collect more detailed information, we applied it to the case of Knokke-Heist (Belgium). Based on the evaluation of this city, some recommendations for improvement of its smart city strategy are proposed.},

abstract = {The 20th century was based on local linear engineering of complicated systems. We made cars, airplanes and chemical plants for example. The 21st century has opened a new basis for holistic non-linear design of complex systems, such as the Internet and air traffic management. Interconnectivity, communication and interaction are major attributes of our evolving society. But, more interestingly, we have started to understand that chaos theory may be more important than reductionism, to better understand and thrive on Earth. Systems need to be investigated and tested as wholes, which requires a cross-disciplinary approach and new conceptual principles and tools. Consequently, schools cannot continue to only teach isolated disciplines based on simple reductionism. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) should also be integrated together with the Arts to promote creativity together with rationalization, and move (back) to STEAM (with an "A" for Arts). This concept shift emphasizes the possibility of longer-term socio-technical futures instead of short-term financial predictions that currently lead to uncontrolled economies. Human-centred design (HCD) can contribute to not only improving education technologies, systems and practices, but also as a discipline offering an integrated approach to learning by doing, expressing and critiquing, exploring possible futures, and understanding complex systems: HCD supports learning thinking.},

Research on values in social computing is challenged by disagreement about indicators and objects of study as researchers distribute their focus across contexts of technology design, adoption, and use. This paper draws upon a framework that clarifies how to see values in social computing research by describing values dimensions, comprised of sources and attributes of values in sociotechnical systems. This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions. By detailing how and where researchers might observe interactions between values and technology design and use, we hope to enable researchers to systematically identify and investigate values in social computing.},

abstract = {The suggestion of Points of Interest to people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) challenges recommender systems research because these users' perception of places is influenced by idiosyncratic sensory aversions which can mine their experience by causing stress and anxiety. Therefore, managing individual preferences is not enough to provide these people with suitable recommendations. In order to address this issue, we propose a Top-N recommendation model that combines the user's idiosyncratic aversions with her/his preferences in a personalized way to suggest the most compatible and likable Points of Interest for her/him. We are interested in finding a user-specific balance of compatibility and interest within a recommendation model that integrates heterogeneous evaluation criteria to appropriately take these aspects into account. We tested our model on both ASD and "neurotypical" people. The evaluation results show that, on both groups, our model outperforms in accuracy and ranking capability the recommender systems based on item compatibility, on user preferences, or which integrate these two aspects by means of a uniform evaluation model.},

abstract = {Much of the research into integrating performance analysis in the design process has focused on the use of building information models (BIM) as input for analysis engines. The main disadvantage of this approach is that BIM models are resource intensive and thus are usually developed in the later stages of design. BIM models are also not necessarily compatible with energy analysis engines and thus a conversion and export process is needed. This can lead to data loss, calculation errors, and failures.Starting with the premise that energy analysis is more compatible with earlier design stages where simpler schematic models are the norm, this paper presents a software system that integrates non-manifold spatial topology, a parametric design environment and an energy analysis engine for a more seamless generate-test cycle in the early design stages. The paper includes a description of the system architecture, initial results, and an outline of future work.},

By minimizing the role of arguably error-prone human drivers, self-driving vehicles are heralded for improving traffic safety. Primarily driven by the technology’s potential impact, there is a rapidly evolving body of literature focused on consumer preferences. Missing, we argue, are studies that explore the needs and design preferences of older adults (60+). This is a significant knowledge gap, given the disproportionate impact that self-driving vehicles may have concerning personal mobility for older adults who are unable or unwilling to drive. Within this paper, we explore the design and interaction preferences of older adults through a series of enactment-based design sessions. This work contributes insights into the needs of older adults, which may prove critical if equal access to emerging self-driving technologies are to be realized.},

We also explore the roles of human and non-human intermediaries in ecologies of care and the potential for enhancing patient empowerment in current clinical treatment contexts. We discuss how military culture can be utilized in clinical care, how multiple perspectives can be leveraged to create a more holistic view of the patient, and finally, how veterans can be empowered during treatment. We conclude with recommendations for the design of sociotechnical systems that prioritize the above in support of the mental well-being of veterans with PTSD.},

In particular, a Companion prototype for reminiscing about a photo collection, called PhotoPal, is being used in our experiments. Several Wizard of Oz experiments have been run to assess people's reactions and thoughts about using a Companion interface. The feedback from these experiments has informed both the design direction and choice of development technologies going forward. The Wizard of Oz system has also been put to use in a classroom of young pupils and to aid adults make more productive use of the Internet for learning.

abstract = {Online content creators have to manage their relations with opaque, proprietary algorithms that platforms employ to rank, filter, and recommend content. How do content creators make sense of these algorithms and what does that teach us about the roles that algorithms play in the social world? We take the case of YouTube because of its widespread use and the spaces for collective sense-making and mutual aid that content creators (YouTubers) have built within the last decade. We engaged with YouTubers in one-on-one interviews, performed content analysis on YouTube videos that discuss the algorithm, and conducted a wiki survey on YouTuber online groups. This triangulation of methodologies afforded us a rich understanding of content creators' understandings, priorities, and wishes as they relate to the algorithm. We found that YouTubers assign human characteristics to the algorithm to explain its behavior; what we have termed algorithmic personas. We identify three main algorithmic personas on YouTube: Agent, Gatekeeper, and Drug Dealer. We propose algorithmic personas as a conceptual framework that describes the new roles that algorithmic systems take on in the social world. As we face new challenges around the ethics and politics of algorithmic platforms such as YouTube, algorithmic personas describe roles that are familiar and can help develop our understanding of algorithmic power relations and accountability mechanisms.},

Through our concept of user centric regulation (UCR) we unpack what a closer alignment of IT design and regulation could mean. We also situate how they can respond to their ethical and legal duties to end users. Our concept asserts that human computer interaction (HCI) designers are now regulators and as designers are not traditionally involved in the practice of regulation hence the nature of their role is ill-defined. We believe designers need support in understanding what their new role entails, particularly managing ethical dimensions that go beyond law and compliance. We use conceptual analysis to consolidate perspectives from across Human Computer Interaction and Information Technology Law and Regulation, Computer Ethics, Philosophy of Technology, and beyond. We focus in this paper on the importance of mediation and responsibility and illustrate our argument by drawing on the emerging technological setting of smart cities.},

People increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. Moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. The Ambient Birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. We trialled the Ambient Birdhouse with five families. Key findings are that the playful nature of the Birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. Children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the Birdhouse. Learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning.},

abstract = {Agent based simulations often model humans and increasingly it is necessary to do this at an appropriate level of complexity. It has been suggested that the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) paradigm is suitable for modeling the cognitive processes of agents representing (some of) the humans in an agent based modeling simulation. This approach models agents as having goals, and reacting to events, with high level plans, or plan types, that are gradually refined as situations unfold. This is an intuitive approach for modeling human cognitive processes. However, it is important that users can understand, verify and even contribute to the model being used. We describe a tool that can be used to explore, understand and modify, the BDI model of an agent's cognitive processes within a simulation. The tool is interactive and allows users to explore options available (and not available) at a particular agent decision point.},

We provide two examples of its use to support prototype evaluation, design reflection and generative and iterative design.

abstract = {People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) suffer from declining mobility capabilities, which cause a prevalent risk of falling. Commonly, short periods of motor blocks occur during walking, known as freezing of gait (FoG). To slow the progressive decline of motor abilities, people with PD usually undertake stationary motor-training exercises in the clinics or supervised by physiotherapists. We present a wearable system for the support of people with PD and FoG. The system is designed for independent use. It enables motor training and gait assistance at home and other unsupervised environments. The system consists of three components. First, FoG episodes are detected in real time using wearable inertial sensors and a smartphone as the processing unit. Second, a feedback mechanism triggers a rhythmic auditory signal to the user to alleviate freeze episodes in an assistive mode. Third, the smartphone-based application features support for training exercises. Moreover, the system allows unobtrusive and long-term monitoring of the user’s clinical condition by transmitting sensing data and statistics to a telemedicine service.We investigate the at-home acceptance of the wearable system in a study with nine PD subjects. Participants deployed and used the system on their own, without any clinical support, at their homes during three protocol sessions in 1 week. Users’ feedback suggests an overall positive attitude toward adopting and using the system in their daily life, indicating that the system supports them in improving their gait. Further, in a data-driven analysis with sensing data from five participants, we study whether there is an observable effect on the gait during use of the system. In three out of five subjects, we observed a decrease in FoG duration distributions over the protocol days during gait-training exercises. Moreover, sensing data-driven analysis shows a decrease in FoG duration and FoG number in four out of five participants when they use the system as a gait-assistive tool during normal daily life activities at home.},

However, the algorithms underpinning NLG have come under scrutiny for reinforcing gender, racial, and other problematic biases. Recent research in NLG seeks to remove these biases through principles of fairness and privacy. Drawing on gender and queer theories from sociology and Science and Technology studies, we consider how NLG can contribute towards the advancement of gender equity in society. We propose a conceptual framework and technical parameters for aligning NLG with feminist HCI qualities. We present three approaches: (1) adhering to current approaches of removing sensitive gender attributes, (2) steering gender differences away from the norm, and (3) queering gender by troubling stereotypes. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these approaches across three hypothetical scenarios; newspaper headlines, job advertisements, and chatbots. We conclude by discussing considerations for implementing this framework and related ethical and equity agendas.},

abstract = {Streetscape visualizations are necessary for the understanding and evaluation of urban design alternatives. Alongside blueprints and textual descriptions, these design aids can affect city-form, building-codes and regulations for decades to come. Yet despite major advancements in computer graphics, crafting high-quality streetscape visualizations is still a complex, lengthy and costly task, especially for real-time, multiparty design sessions. Here we present DeepScope, a generative, lightweight and real-time HCI platform for urban planning and cityscape visualization. DeepScope is composed of a Generative Neural Network (DCGAN) and a Tangible User Interface (TUI) designed for multi-participants urban design sessions and real-time feedback. In this paper we explore the design, development and deployment of the DeepScope platform, as well as discuss the potential implementation of DeepScope in urban design processes.},

The survey focused on the question of embodiment and its different modalities in the fields of acoustic and digital instruments. The questions of control, instrumental entropy, limitations and creativity were addressed in relation to people's activities of playing, creating or modifying their instruments. The approach used in the survey was phenomenological, i.e. we were concerned with the experience of playing, composing for and designing digital or acoustic instruments. At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc.},

We argue that there is a unique role for the HCI community in linking the design and application of blockchain technology towards lived experience and the articulation of human values. In particular, we note how the accounting of transactions, a trust in immutable code and algorithms, and the leveraging of distributed crowds and publics around vast interoperable databases all relate to longstanding issues of importance for the field. We conclude by highlighting core conceptual and methodological challenges for HCI researchers beginning to work with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.},

With the ever-increasing concentration of people in urban areas, more and more people suffer from the negative effects of air pollutants. Crowdsensing systems are a unique chance to increase the users' awareness of this problem and to provide more fine-grained data to policymakers so that they can adopt appropriate strategies. In this paper, we present a crowdsensing system to collect air pollution in urban and suburban environments through the use of bicycles. It consists of a Web application, enriched with gamification elements, that communicates with a portable low-cost sensor. The user interface of such a system, as well as the adopted gamification mechanisms, has been designed by involving a group of target users, with the aim of better meeting users' preferences and needs, and, then, better engaging them.},

abstract = {A key challenge for mixed-initiative systems is to create a shared understanding of the task between human and agent. To address this challenge, we created a mixed-initiative interface called Mixer to aid administrators with automating tedious information-retrieval tasks. Users initiate communication with the agent by constructing a form, creating a structure to hold the information they require and to show context in order to interpret this information. They then populate the form with the desired results, demonstrating to the agent the steps required to retrieve the information. This method of form creation explicitly defines the shared understanding between human and agent. An evaluation of the interface shows that administrators can effectively create forms to communicate with the agent, that they are likely to accept this technology in their work environment, and that the agent's help can significantly reduce the time they spend on repeated information-retrieval tasks.},

However, studies have yet to focus on the ways in which these technologies are used by individuals who are blind, along with whether barriers are encountered during the process of interaction. To address this gap, we interviewed fourteen legally-blind adults with experience of home and/or mobile-based VAPAs. While participants appreciated the access VAPAs provided to inaccessible applications and services, they faced challenges relating to the input, responses from VAPAs, and control of information presented. User behavior varied depending on the situation or context of the interaction. Implications for design are suggested to support inclusivity when interacting with VAPAs. These include accounting for privacy and situational factors in design, examining ways to support concerns over trust, and synchronizing presentation of visual and non-visual cues.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight legally-blind participants, and presented them with three scenarios to inspire discussion relating to SIIDs. Nine main themes emerged from analysis of the participant interviews, including the challenges faced when using a mobile device one-handed while using a cane to detect obstacles along the intended path, the impact of using a mobile device under inhospitable conditions, and concerns associated with using a mobile device in environments where privacy and safety may be compromised (e.g. when using public transport). These were found to reduce the quality of the subjective interaction experience, and in some cases limiting use of mobile technologies in public venues. Insights from our research can be used to guide the design of future mobile interfaces to better meet the needs of users whose needs are often excluded from the design process.},

abstract = {Authentication based on touchless mid-air gestures would benefit a multitude of ubiquitous computing applications, especially those that are used in clean environments (e.g., medical environments or clean rooms). In order to explore the potential of mid-air gestures for novel authentication approaches, we performed a series of studies and design experiments. First, we collected data from more then 200 users during a 3-day science event organized within a shopping mall. These data were used to investigate capabilities of the Leap Motion sensor, observe interaction in the wild, and to formulate an initial design problem. The design problem, as well as the design of mid-air gestures for authentication purposes, were iterated in subsequent design activities. In a final study with 13 participants, we evaluated two mid-air gestures for authentication purposes in different situations, including different body positions. Our results highlight a need for different mid-air gestures for differing situations and carefully chosen constraints for mid-air gestures. We conclude by proposing an exemplary system, which aims to provide tool-support for designers and engineers, allowing them to explore authentication gestures in the original context of use and thus support them with the design of contextual mid-air authentication gestures.},

The media instruments we constructed during our workshops are based on trial-and-error development of signal processing symmetrizing action and perception, designed without pre-schematizing, abstract models of user intention or semantics. Hence we outline a pre-reflective, pre-individual, sub-semantic approach to relational media synthesis.},

abstract = {Statistical topic models can help analysts discover patterns in large text corpora by identifying recurring sets of words and enabling exploration by topical concepts. However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations - interpretation and trust - for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of "word-borrowing" that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.},

Many attempts have been made to design co-creation platforms that allow end users to personalize their own shoes. Those co-creation platforms primarily concentrate on color selection. This research takes a different approach and designs a toolkit for maker-oriented users to co-manufacture their own shoes. The toolkit was designed in different levels and deployed to makers via crowdsharing worldwide. Backers were surveyed before deployment and interviewed after two years to understand personalization over a larger amount of time with the research product. We find that users who have greater bespoke tools and materials in their toolkits are more likely to personalize their shoes while co-manufacturing. The research provides guidelines for researchers and designers creating toolkits, designing personalization product service systems/configurators and engaging in tangible bespoke processes.},

Because interaction with sound may be task oriented or experience-based it is important to understand the nature of action-sound relationships in order to design rich sonic interactions. We propose a participatory approach to sonic interaction design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build richer sonic interactions.},

In particular, Amazon's conversational agent, Alexa, now dominates the market and is in millions of homes. This paper presents two complementary studies investigating the experience of households living with a conversational agent over an extended period of time. First, we gathered the history logs of 75 Alexa participants and quantitatively analyzed over 278,000 commands. Second, we performed seven in-home, contextual interviews of Alexa owners focusing on how their household interacts with Alexa. Our findings give the first glimpse of how households integrate Alexa into their lives.

abstract = {Individuals with cognitive impairments currently leverage extensive human resources during their transitions from assisted living to independent living. In Western Europe, many government-supported volunteer organizations provide sheltered living facilities; supervised environments in which people with cognitive impairments collaboratively learn daily living skills. In this paper, we describe communal cooking practices in sheltered living facilities and identify opportunities for supporting these with interactive technology to reduce volunteer workload. We conducted two contextual observations of twelve people with cognitive impairments cooking in sheltered living facilities and supplemented this data through interviews with four employees and volunteers who supervise them. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes to inform design requirements for communal cooking activities: Work organization, community, supervision, and practicalities. Based on these, we present five design implications for assistive systems in kitchens for people with cognitive deficiencies.},

Such a vision relies on integration of multiple subfields of computer science, and a commitment to an understanding of the domain of application. It supports the hopes of a grid/cyberinfrastructure-enabled future that makes use of social software. However, in contrast to how emergency management is often understood, it aims to push beyond the idea of monitoring on-line activity, and instead focuses on an understudied but critical aspect of mass emergency response---the needs and roles of members of the public. By viewing the citizenry as a powerful, self-organizing, and collectively intelligent force, information and communication technology can play a transformational role in crisis. Critical topics for research and development include an understanding of the quantity and quality of information (and its continuous change) produced through computer-mediated communication during emergencies; mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness and security of information; mechanisms for aligning informal and formal sources of information; and new applications of information extraction techniques.},

In this paper we present the JavaFest, a collaborative learning technique for teaching Java to beginning programmers. A JavaFest is a group exercise that instructors can add to their repertoire of teaching techniques. It provides an opportunity for students to practice programming in a motivating but non-threatening environment, and to learn from the experience of their peers. Moreover, a JavaFest allows the instructor to gain insight into the current standing of the students in her class.We describe the concept of a JavaFest and present three case studies in the form of three concrete JavaFests we developed and evaluated in our own object-oriented programming course. The general idea of a JavaFest, and the three specific examples we describe and evaluate, can easily be adopted to enhance any Java programming course.},

Progress in falls rehabilitation, which consists of improved performance in balance and muscle strength, is essential to assuring seniors of a reduced risk of falling. In this paper, we build on our previous research into exergames for falls, and we investigate how an exergame system can be used to communicate long-term progress to seniors. Using a multiphase user-centered requirements gathering process, we first investigated stakeholder perspectives regarding progress in self-managed rehabilitation. Following this we describe the home-based evaluation of our prototype exergame system, which highlights rehabilitation progress, with seniors, over a period of 2 months. Progress, in our system is communicated using charts of exercise performance and frequency, as well as medals awarded for achieving longer-term rehabilitation milestones. We report on seniors' opinions and preferences regarding the potential of our exergame system to communicate this rehabilitation progress in a meaningful way. Finally we discuss implications for design, based on our studies, to inform the development of more effective exergame systems for long-term unassisted rehabilitation in the home.},

abstract = {As a pandemic rages and ecosystems around the globe collapse, the LIMITS community---along with the rest of the world---is working to adapt. Some adaptations to adjust to emergencies are easy to imagine. For example, months before in-person conferences were canceled in response to COVID-19, the User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) 2019 conference took significant steps towards hosting a geographically distributed, virtual conference, in part adapting to the global climate emergency. This type of change is conceptually clear, if organizationally challenging. However, many needed changes are conceptually difficult, even in the midst of an existential crisis. It is long-recognized that we need to bridge the separation between scholarly venues and publications that focus on technical aspects of computing systems (i.e., "applied") and those that center social and political aspects of computing systems research and design, particularly when attempting to address complex life-wide problems. Yet, disciplinary crystals (e.g., siloes) remain resistant to change. The authors of this paper contribute to ongoing socio-technical efforts, identifying dominant practices and forces that reinforce the socio-technical divide, and holding up empirical projects that offer promising alternatives.We resist the dominant norm to claim that our contributions to scholarship are original, cutting-edge, or unique. Rather this paper revisits a research paradigm from the past because it remains useful and generative for the computing research communities of the future. Through our inquiry we identify a long-standing tendency to include a pivot---a distinct turn to privilege the design of new digital artifacts---even in papers advocating for more expansive conceptualizations of interactive systems. While acknowledging the importance of the initial design of material artifacts (and their associated infrastructures), we reject the assumption that the ultimate "good" of computing or interactive design research is creating new digital artifacts/tools for the marketplace. We offer four provocations to help us understand why material-based, industry-oriented narratives dominate applied venues of computing. Empirical examples from projects around the world, including work that extends the relational and temporal boundaries of computing design, offer alternative approaches.Fundamentally, we ask readers to consider the type of research that the LIMITS community values and in what ways is this scholarship of value to a world in crisis. How does LIMITs research matter?},

To help these individuals, we designed Robin, a conceptual context-aware assistive application that supports independent living for users with cognitive impairments by providing temporally and physically appropriate audio prompting for the routine tasks that are most important for health outcomes and life satisfaction.},

Since the time of our early ancestors, our brains have gotten no bigger; nevertheless, there has been a steady accretion of new tools for intellectual work (including advanced visual interfaces) and an increasing distribution of complex activities among many minds. Despite this transcendence of human cognition beyond what is "inside" a person's head, most studies and frameworks on cognition have disregarded the social, physical, and artifactual surroundings in which cognition and human activity take place.Distributed intelligence provides an effective theoretical framework for understanding what humans can achieve and how artifacts and tools can be designed and evaluated to empower human beings and to change tasks.This paper presents and discusses the conceptual frameworks and systems that we have developed over the last decade to create effective socio-technical environments supporting distributed intelligence.},

abstract = {It is common to use computers to design shapes of physical objects such as furniture, but geometric modeling and the physical validity of shapes are conventionally considered independently. This makes creating aesthetically pleasing yet physically valid models challenging. In this paper, we propose an interactive design framework for the efficient and intuitive exploration of geometrically and physically valid shapes. During any geometric editing operation, the system continuously allows visualization of the valid range of the parameters being edited. When one or more constraints are violated following an operation, the system generates multiple suggestions involving both discrete and continuous changes to restore validity. Each suggestion is accompanied by an editing mode, which simultaneously adjusts multiple parameters in a coordinated manner to maintain validity. Thus, while the user focuses on the aesthetics of the design, our computational design framework helps to achieve physical realizability by providing active guidance to the user. We demonstrate our framework on plank-based furniture designs with nail-joints and frictional constraints. We use our system to design a range of examples, conduct a user study, and also fabricate a physical prototype to test its validity and usefulness.},

Pocket Skills teaches DBT via a conversational agent modeled on Marsha Linehan, who developed DBT. We examined the feasibility of Pocket Skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use. We present a model based on qualitative findings of how Pocket Skills supported DBT. Pocket Skills helped participants engage in their DBT and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their DBT skills and increase their self-efficacy.

Friend moderators intercept email from strangers and can reject, organize, and redirect emails, as well as collaborate on filters. Squadbox is designed to let its users implement highly customized workflows, as we found in interviews that harassment and preferences for mitigating it vary widely.

Our work draws on research in HCI and the social sciences and findings from ethnographic studies in four sites -- two amateur "fixers" collectives' in Brooklyn and Seattle, USA and two mobile phone repair communities in Uganda and Bangladesh -- to advance two arguments. First, studies of repair account for new sites and processes of value that differ from those appearing at HCI's better-studied moments of design and use. Second, repair may embed modes of human interaction with technology and with each other in ways that surface values as contingent and ongoing accomplishments, suggesting ongoing processes of valuation that can never be fully fixed or commoditized. These insights help HCI account for human relationships to technology built into the world through repair.},

abstract = {The challenges related to the development of automated vehicles are not only of a technical nature, but also affect the quality of on-board interaction. The role of the HMI is crucial to manage unexpected events and ensure a safe and smooth transition of control. The workshop will promote and discuss the approach used in the HMI design for autonomous vehicles realized from the European projects ADAS&amp;ME and AutoMate. ADAS&amp;ME is dedicated to the creation of new driver state adaptive ADAS that incorporate driver/rider state, the situational and environmental context, as well as the adaptive interaction to automatically transfer control. AutoMate will enhance safety by using the strength of both the automation and driver in a dynamic situation dependent way. In the workshop the main challenges emerged in the projects will be discussed with the audience, to obtain feedbacks and enhancements, and to highlight themes and strategies not yet emerged.},

abstract = {The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum, a realization of such a platform, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with realtime assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden- and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.},

abstract = {The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.},

abstract = {Over the past years, Virtual Archaeology has introduced more experiential elements in virtual reconstructions, therefore going beyond the traditional visualization of 3D architectural models. In the case of dissemination, these experiences equate to a trip in time, in which users witness what the past was like and learn about it. However, due to a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks and/or systematic evaluation focusing on such experiential elements, it is uncertain whether the intended goals are achieved and why. Based on a novel theoretical framework arising from the concept of Cultural Presence, this article will investigate if and how current virtual environments achieve the feeling of traveling to the past. To that end, six different virtual reconstructions of the Neolithic site of \c{C}atalh\"{o}y\"{u}k (Turkey) were built and evaluated in a between-subjects experiment. The results support the role of content meaningfulness, responsive characters, enhanced interaction, and multisensory realism in the achievement of successful Virtual Reality--mediated experiences.},

abstract = {End-users are often perceived as the weakest link in information security. Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.},

One of the main barriers to assisting individuals with pointing problems is a lack of frequent and low-cost assessment of pointing ability. We are working to build technology to automatically assess pointing problems during every day (or real-world) computer use. To this end, we have gathered and studied real-world pointing use from individuals with motor impairments and older adults. We have used this data to develop novel techniques to analyze pointing performance. In this article, we present learned statistical models that distinguish between pointing actions from diverse populations using real-world pointing samples. We describe how our models could be used to support individuals with different abilities sharing a computer, or one individual who experiences temporary pointing problems. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of real-world pointing. We hope that these techniques will be used to develop systems that can automatically adapt to users’ current needs in real-world computing environments.},

Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.},

We analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. The results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. It is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development.},

Previous reviews looked at deformation as a material property of shape-changing interfaces and concentrated on output. As such,deformable input was under-discussed. We distinguish deformable from shape-changing interfaces to concentrate on input. We survey 131 papers on deformable interfaces and review their key design elements (e.g., shape, material) based on how they support input. Our survey shows that deformable input was often used to augment or replace rigid input, particularly on elastic and flexible displays. However, when shapes and materials guide interactions, deformable input was used to explore new HCI paradigms, where gestures are potentially endless, and input become analogy to sculpting, metaphor to non-verbal communication, and expressive controls are enhanced. Our review provides designers and practitioners with a baseline for designing deformable interfaces and input methodically. We conclude by highlighting under-explored areas and identify research goals to tackle in future work with deformable interfaces.},

Over the course of the research, we found internet of things technologies-or, connected devices imbued with computational capacity-became increasingly tied up with cost-reducing efficiencies and exploitative regulatory techniques. Drawing from this case study, we develop the concept of managerial visions: ways of seeing that structure labor, enforce compliance, and define access to resources. We argue that these ways of seeing prove increasingly critical to HCI research as it attends to computer-mediated collaboration beyond white-collar settings.},

abstract = {Recent decade has seen a dramatic change in the information systems landscape that alters the ways we design and interact with information technologies, including such developments as the rise of business analytics, user-generated content, and NoSQL databases, to name just a few. These changes challenge conceptual modeling research to offer innovative solutions tailored to these environments. Conceptual models typically represent classes (categories, kinds) of objects rather than concrete specific objects, making the class construct a critical medium for capturing domain semantics. While representation of classes may differ between grammars, a common design assumption is what we term different semantics same syntax (D3S). Under D3S, all classes are depicted using the same syntactic symbols. Following recent findings in psychology, we introduce a novel assumption semantics-contingent syntax (SCS) whereby syntactic representations of classes in conceptual models may differ based on their semantic meaning. We propose a core SCS design principle and five guidelines pertinent for conceptual modeling. We believe SCS carries profound implications for theory and practice of conceptual modeling as it seeks to better support modern information environments.},

abstract = {Bots are estimated to account for well over half of all web traffic, yet they remain an understudied topic in HCI. In this paper we present the findings of an analysis of 2284 submissions across three discussion groups dedicated to the request, creation and discussion of bots on Reddit. We set out to examine the qualities and functionalities of bots and the practical and social challenges surrounding their creation and use. Our findings highlight the prevalence of misunderstandings around the capabilities of bots, misalignments in discourse between novices who request and more expert members who create them, and the prevalence of requests that are deemed to be inappropriate for the Reddit community. In discussing our findings, we suggest future directions for the design and development of tools that support more carefully guided and reflective approaches to bot development for novices, and tools to support exploring the consequences of contextually-inappropriate bot ideas.},

abstract = {Cities act as hubs designed to accommodate and support millions of inhabitants, nomads and tourists that rely on the city's infrastructure to move around, communicate and flourish as individuals and as a community. This shapes the culture, habits and pulse of a city creating an organic urban landscape often invisible to the naked eye, but traceable digitally. With the proliferation of sensing and pervasive technologies, we should be able to tell the levels of crowdedness of the city, its mood, or how clean it is by sensing and visualising these aspects. However, this poses interesting research and design questions; how would one design a device for tracking and visualising crowdedness on buses, for example. This workshop aims to explore the use of sensing technologies for visually resurfacing some of the hidden dynamics of the city by providing a collaborative and facilitated environment for applied research and creative exploration. This complements other workshops in the "urban" or "cities" theme, such as PURBA (Pervasive Urban Applications), that investigate urban environments from a theoretical perspective. After initial discussions on a joint workshop, the SenCity and PURBA organisers concluded that these workshops were complementary yet different enough to give participants the benefit of taking part in both; gaining the theory from PURBA and collaboratively applying practical research and creative flair at the SenCity workshop to sense, visualise and share the hidden pulse of Z\"{u}rich.},

abstract = {Motivation -- Modern collaborative environments often provide an overwhelming amount of visual information on multiple displays. The multitude of personal and shared interaction devices leads to lack of awareness of team members on ongoing activities, and awareness of who is in control of shared artefacts. This research addresses the situational awareness (SA) support of multidisciplinary teams in co-located collaborative environments. This work aims at getting insights into design and evaluation of large displays systems that afford SA and effective teamwork.Research approach -- An exploratory (Wassink et al., 2008) as well as experimental approach is applied. The results of our exploratory studies, which included contextual observations, interviews and task analysis, have been translated into requirements for support of multidisciplinary teamwork in life sciences (Kulyk and Wassink, 2006). Currently we perform practical case studies in omics experimentation domain (Kulyk et al., 2007). In a first controlled study we assess shared SA of team members, providing new SA concepts on a shared large display.Findings/Design -- We developed several concepts for SA support on large shared displays. Memory Board is an interface that automatically stores and visualizes the activity history on a shared large display. This allows team members to retrieve annotations made on previous slides or visualizations. It also provides awareness of who is currently in control of any display, and who is manipulating and annotating the visualizations. Highlighting on Demand interface enables a team member to highlight or fade out any part of a display using any personal interaction device.Take away message -- Designing systems that support situational awareness is of great importance to ensure that a collaborative environment enables efficient and effective team coordination and decision making.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have been deployed with considerable success in many industries. However, the implementation of cyber-physical systems in hospitals has been limited. By nature, in clinical operations, patient safety and consideration for health outcomes are of the utmost importance, thus possibly slowing the implementation of innovative solutions with limited history. Revenues from operating room (OR) time and surgery account for about 50% of the income of major hospitals (Erdogan et al. 2011; Cuschieri 2006), but the efficiency of OR utilization is often reported to be relatively low. Therefore, improving OR management with a cyber-physical system should be a priority. In this article, we will report on our experience implementing a cyber-physical system at Houston Methodist Hospital and discuss some of the difficulties and potential drivers for success. Our pilot study was done in the context of the management of a large suite of ORs. It uses the agile codevelopment of a cyber-physical system through an intense collaboration of clinicians and computational scientists. While technology remains the foundation of a cyber-physical system, this experience reinforced that the human factor is an important driving force behind the design that promotes user acceptance.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

abstract = {Opioid use disorder (OUD) poses substantial risks to personal well-being and public health. In online communities, users support those seeking recovery, in part by promoting clinically grounded treatments. However, some communities also promote clinically unverified OUD treatments, such as unregulated and untested drugs. Little research exists on which alternative treatments people use, whether these treatments are effective for recovery, or if they cause negative side effects. We provide the first large-scale social media study of clinically unverified, alternative treatments in OUD recovery on Reddit, partnering with an addiction research scientist. We adopt transfer learning across 63 subreddits to precisely identify posts related to opioid recovery. Then, we quantitatively discover potential alternative treatments and contextualize their effectiveness. Our work benefits health research and practice by identifying undiscovered recovery strategies. We also discuss the impacts to online communities dealing with stigmatized behavior and research ethics.},

In this paper we aim to capture the software engineering practices of environmental scientists, highlight opportunities for software engineering and work towards developing a domain specific language for the configuration and deployment of environmental models. We hold a series of interviews with environmental scientists involved in developing and deploying computer based environmental models about the approach taken in engineering models, and describe a case study in deploying an environmental model (WRF: Weather Research Forecasting) on a cloud architecture. From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment. Together, we propose they will allow scientists to concentrate on fundamental science rather than specifics of the underlying computing.},

User-centered design advocates the use of prototyping to help designers create software that is a better fit with user needs and yet, due to time pressures or inappropriate tool support, prototyping may be considered too costly to do. To address these concerns, we designed ProtoActive, a tool for designing and evaluating multi-touch applications on large surfaces via sketch-based prototypes. Our tool allows designers to define custom gestures and evaluate them without requiring any programming knowledge.

Such digitization enables the use of automated digital image analysis techniques, which could be beneficial for the diagnostic review and prognosis of a variety of conditions. As yet, human-computer interaction (HCI) issues in this field, which is mostly based on visual analysis, have not been systematically explored. Based on reflecting on the process of designing and deploying systems for digital pathology, we propose a new understanding to design automated tools for such environments. We used meeting minutes, design briefs, interviews, personal notes and other artifacts to conduct a thematic analysis. This enabled us to establish four design considerations for introducing digital image analysis to routine pathology that concern level of detail, verification, communication and transparency.},

We present the results of a study that used a technology probe at a large festival to explore initial public responses to this reframing -- focusing on when and to whom users would delegate such decisions. The results reveal substantial public interest in delegating consent and identify differing preferences depending on the privacy context, highlighting the need for alternative decision mechanisms beyond the current focus on individual choice.},

In particular, creating prototypes that employ advanced touch and mid-air gestures still requires significant technical experience and programming skill. Inspired by $1's easy, cheap, and flexible design, we present the GestureWiz prototyping environment that provides designers with an integrated solution for gesture definition, conflict checking, and real-time recognition by employing human recognizers in a Wizard of Oz manner. We present a series of experiments with designers and crowds to show that GestureWiz can perform with reasonable accuracy and latency. We demonstrate advantages of GestureWiz when recreating gesture-based interfaces from the literature and conducting a study with 12 interaction designers that prototyped a multimodal interface with support for a wide range of novel gestures in about 45 minutes.},

Applications of AGR are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. However, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards AGR and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. To begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards AGR. We found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards AGR and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. They raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. We present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems.},

Emerging water sensing systems, however, can provide detailed usage data at the level of individual water fixtures (i.e., disaggregated usage data). In this paper, we perform formative evaluations of two sets of novel eco-feedback displays that take advantage of this disaggregated data. The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas).},

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge no existing SWfMSs directly support collaboration. Data is increasing in complexity, dimensionality, and volume, and the efficient analysis of data often goes beyond the realm of an individual and requires collaboration with multiple researchers from varying domains. In this paper, we propose a groupware system architecture for data analysis that in addition to supporting collaboration, also incorporates features from SWfMSs to support modern data analysis processes. As a proof of concept for the proposed architecture we developed SciWorCS - a groupware system for scientific data analysis. We present two real-world use-cases: collaborative software repository analysis and bioinformatics data analysis. The results of the experiments evaluating the proposed system are promising. Our bioinformatics user study demonstrates that SciWorCS can leverage real-world data analysis tasks by supporting real-time collaboration among users.},

abstract = {Public attitudes towards learning disabilities (LDs) are generally reported as positive, inclusive and empathetic. However, these findings do not reflect the lived experiences of people with LDs. To shed light on this disparity, a team of co-researchers with LDs created the first online survey to challenge public understanding of LDs, asking questions in ways that are important to them and represent how they see themselves. Here, we describe and evaluate the process of creating an accessible survey platform and an online survey in a research team consisting of academic and non-academic professionals with and without LDs or autism. Through this inclusive research process, the co-designed survey met the expectations of the co-researchers and was well-received by the initial survey respondents. We reflect on the co-researchers' perspectives following the study completion, and consider the difficulties and advantages we encountered deploying such approaches and their potential implications on future survey data analysis.},

abstract = {Despite the divisive nature of abortion within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, where access to safe, legal abortion is severely restricted, effecting legislative reform demands widespread public support. In light of a building pro-choice counter-voice, this work contributes to a growing body of HCI research that takes an activist approach to design. We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. Furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing 'stepping stones' to activism.},

To understand the development since previous meta-review efforts, we conducted a state-of-the-art review of UX evaluation techniques with special attention to the triangulation between methods. We systematically selected and analyzed 100 papers from recent years and while we found an increase of relevant UX studies, we also saw a remaining overlap with pure usability evaluations. Positive trends include an increasing percentage of field rather than lab studies and a tendency to combine several methods in UX studies. Triangulation was applied in more than two thirds of the studies, and the most common method combination was questionnaires and interviews. Based on our analysis, we derive common patterns for triangulation in UX evaluation efforts. A critical discussion about existing approaches should help to obtain stronger results, especially when evaluating new technologies.},

With power structures emboldening inequality highly prevalent and persuasive in Western societies, these seep into current practices of Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Hence, developing an increased awareness of our societal responsibility towards equity can be challenging without an appropriate starting point. We present a close reading of literature discussing gender sensitivity in HCI research to provide practical guidance in the form of recommendations for the design, proposal, conduct and presentation of research. Our analysis provides a starting point for HCI students and interested researchers to explore questions and issues around gender and to identify how gender relates to their research. This sensitisation may aid them in further reflecting on how they might better serve marginalised populations through their work.},

These forces drive the demand for more de- sign instruction in HCI classrooms. In this paper, we distill the popular approaches to teaching design to undergraduate and graduate students of HCI. Through a review of existing research on design pedagogy, an international survey of 61 HCI educators, and an analysis of popular textbooks, we ex- plore the prominent disciplinary perspectives that shape design education in the HCI classroom. We draw on our analyses to discuss the differences we see in forms of design taught, approaches to adapting design instruction in computing-based courses, and the tensions faced by instructors of these classes. We conclude by arguing for the importance of pedagogical research on design instruction as a vital and foundational area of inquiry in Interaction Design and HCI.},

To help manage the grid effectively, these meters are designed to collect information on power consumption and send it to third parties. With Smart Metering, for the first time, these cloud-connected sensing devices are legally mandated to be installed in the homes of millions of people worldwide. Via a multi-staged empirical study that utilized an open-ended questionnaire, focus groups, and a design probe, we examined how people characterize the tension between the utility of Smart Metering and its impact on privacy. Our findings show that people seek to make abstract Smart Metering data accountable by connecting it to their everyday practices.

Turning these research outputs into productive interventions, however, is difficult. We argue that design is well positioned to address such a challenge thanks to its methodological traditions of problem setting and framing situated in synthetic (rather than analytic) knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on designing for experiences of menopause. Building on our prior empirical work on menopause and our commitment to pursue design informed by women's lived experience, we iteratively generated dozens of design frames and accompanying design crits. We document the unfolding of our design reasoning, showing how good-seeming insights nonetheless often lead to bad designs, while working progressively towards stronger insights and design constructs. The latter we offer as a contribution to researchers and practitioners who work at the intersections of women's health and design.},

abstract = {Route planning is a challenging problem for urban computing that usually involves the processing of a huge amount of data and collaborative user feedback. Traditionally, route planning services are street-based, that is, even paths for a pedestrian are suggested in terms of streets. However, such models are not suitable for users with certain disabilities. To address this problem, we have performed a requirement analysis with a group of wheelchair-users and their companions to understand their urban mobility experience. Given that perspective, we describe in this article a sidewalk-based model to accommodate the needs for a wheelchair route planning service. The model is mathematically defined as a graph, where the vertices are the city block corners and the edges are the sidewalks or crosswalks. The edge costs are derived from important accessibility features, such as distance, path inclination, and existence and maintenance conditions of curb ramps, crosswalks, and sidewalks. The model has been designed so that user feedback is considered to help updating the model when accessibility issues are detected, by wheelchair-users and companions, or solved, by the department of city planning. We also present a route planning algorithm that provides a set of alternative routes based on accessibility conditions, and a shortcut recommender algorithm to support accessibility-related decision making by the department of city planning. Experiments, by using PgRouting and PostGIS with open data, are reported for a Brazilian city neighborhood to validate the model and the route planning service.},

Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present results of the analysis of 50 articles that use methodology and/or evaluation tools used in TUI of the last 5 years. Through the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, it is possible to identify the evaluation approaches used, the instruments and the genres of these applications. From this, the state of the art was defined on the evaluation processes of TUI, contributing to the information base for proposing new evaluation methodologies that respect the particularities of the tangible interaction.},

As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.},

We validate against Bureau of Labor Statistics measures, and then demonstrate benefits for communities, showing significant differences in the types of jobs searched for across socio-economic dimensions like poverty and education level.

Given these forces, we are at a time of opportunity for research impact, with an unusually large potential for influential results across computing, the sciences and society. This report details that discussion, and highlights the group's consensus view of new focus areas, including new database engine architectures, declarative programming languages, the interplay of structured and unstructured data, cloud data services, and mobile and virtual worlds.

We ask the research question: what pain points in scientific media production afford opportunities for future HCI innovation? We then present a grounded theory analysis of 24 interviews with researchers and media professionals, yielding several key contributions. First, we describe two collaborative domains in scientific media production between research advocates and media outlets. Second, we characterize discrete technological gaps and pain points in both domains. Finally, we discuss implications for design and propose solutions from HCI areas like peer production, online communities, recommender systems, and online collaboration.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of "ArmSleeve", a patient monitoring system to support occupational therapists in their upper limb rehabilitation work with stroke patients. Occupational therapists can provide rehabilitation in clinics, but they have limited insights into how much their patients use their affected arm and hand in daily life, which is critical for effective recovery to occur. Our work addresses this problem through three interrelated studies: (1) interviews with therapists to examine their current rehabilitation practices; (2) the design of the "ArmSleeve Sensor" to monitor a patient's upper limb movement; and (3) the design and evaluation of the "ArmSleeve Dashboard" to visualize this information for therapists. The findings show the importance of collecting objective data to assess exercise and activities outside therapy, but also a lack of contextual information to interpret this data. We discuss considerations for how to address this issue through patient engagement as well as considerations for designing wearable sensor technology that is usable in everyday life.},

abstract = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

abstract = {As an answer to the disabled community’s odyssey to gain access to adaptable, modular, multilingual, cheap and sustainable Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) products, we propose the use of the ITHACA framework. It is a software environment for building component-based AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid---community and commercial---Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end users’ communication skills. Developers’ experience on working in ITHACA’s Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged.},

abstract = {Researchers and the media have become increasingly interested in protest users, or people who change (protest use) or stop (protest non-use) their use of a company's products because of the company's values and/or actions. Past work has extensively engaged with the phenomenon of technology non-use but has not focused on non-use (nor changed use) in the context of protest. With recent research highlighting the potential for protest users to exert leverage against technology companies, it is important for technology stakeholders to understand the prevalence of protest users, their motivations, and the specific tactics they currently use. In this paper, we report the results of two surveys (n = 463 and n = 398) of representative samples of American web users that examine if, how, and why people have engaged in protest use and protest non-use of the products of five major technology companies. We find that protest use and protest non-use are relatively common, with 30% of respondents in 2019 reporting they were protesting at least one major tech company. Furthermore, we identify that protest users' most common motivations were (1) concerns about business models that profit from user data and (2) privacy; and the most common tactics were (1) stopping use and (2) leveraging ad blockers. We also identify common challenges and roadblocks faced by active and potential protest users, which include (1) losing social connections and (2) the lack of alternative products. Our results highlight the growing importance of protest users in the technology ecosystem and the need for further social computing research into this phenomenon. We also provide concrete design implications for existing and future technologies to support or account for protest use and protest non-use.},

Through retrospective journals and field notes, we reveal the tensions and nuances in his travel, including the magnified difficulty of social conversations, issues with navigating unfamiliar environments and cultural contexts, and changes in the relationship to personal assistive technologies. By exploring the longitudinal travel experiences of a single individual, we uncover evocative and personal insights rarely available through participant-based research methods. Based on these lived experiences and post hoc reflections, we present two design explorations of personalized technology the autoethnographer created for aiding his travel. Finally, we offer reflections for customized travel technologies for deaf and hard of hearing users, and methodological guidelines for performing first-person research in the context of disability.},

abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: "should I calculate IRR?" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

abstract = {Wearable sensors can provide reliable, automated measures of health behaviors in free-living populations. However, validation of these measures is impossible without observable confirmation of behaviors. Participants have expressed discomfort during the use of ego-centric wearable cameras with first-person view. We argue that mounting the camera on different body locations with a different lens orientation, gives a device recording affordance that has the effect of reducing surveillance and social discomfort compared to ego-centric cameras. We call these types of cameras "activity-oriented" because they are designed to capture a particular activity, rather than the field of view of the wearer. We conducted an experiment of three camera designs with 24 participants, collecting qualitative data on participants' experience while wearing these devices in the wild. We provide a model explaining factors that lead to an increase in social presence and social stigma, which, therefore, create social and surveillance discomfort for the wearer. Wearers' attempts to reduce this discomfort by modifying their behavior or abandoning the device threatens the validity of observations of authentic behaviors. We discuss design implications and provide recommendations to help reduce social presence and stigma in order to improve the validity of observations with cameras in the wild.},

abstract = {This paper describes how to find or filter high-quality ideas submitted by members collaborating together in online communities. Typical means of organizing community submissions, such as aggregating community or crowd votes, suffer from the cold-start problem, the rich-get-richer problem, and the sparsity problem. To circumvent those, our approach learns a ranking model that combines 1) community feedback, 2) idea uniqueness, and 3) text features?e.g., readability, coherence, semantics, etc. This model can then rank order submissions by expected quality, supporting community members in finding content that can inspire them and improve collaboration among members. As illustrative example, we demonstrate the model on OpenIDEO--a collaborative community where high-quality submissions are rewarded by winning design challenges. We find that the proposed ranking model finds winning ideas more effectively than existing ranking techniques (comment sorting), as measured using both Discounted Cumulative Gain and human perceptions of idea quality. We also identify the elements of winning ideas that were highly predictive of subsequent success: 1) engagement with community feedback, 2) submission length, and 3) a submission's uniqueness. Ultimately, our approach enables community members and managers to more effectively manage creative stimuli created by large collaborative communities.},

Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.},

Because Formal Concept Analysis provides suitable knowledge structures to represent the variability of a given system family, we explore the relevance of Relational Concept Analysis, an FCA extension to take into account relationships between different families, to tackle this issue. We investigate a method to extract variability information from descriptions representing several inter-connected product families. It aims to be used to assist the design of inter-connected FMs, and to provide recommendations during product selection.},

In order to support deaf individuals in such situations, an active stream of assistive technology (AT) research focuses on real-time translation of sign language. We investigate the impact of real-time translation-based ATs on communication quality between deaf and hearing individuals. We conducted a focus group and aWizard of Oz study in which deaf and hearing participants jointly interacted with different assistive technologies. We find that while ATs facilitate communication, communication quality is degraded by to breaks in the conversation. Using Co-Cultural Theory, we identify deaf people as a subordinate group inside a hearing society. Our results indicate that current ATs reinforce this subordination by emphasizing deficiency of mastering the dominant form of communication. Based on our findings, we propose a change in design perspective by enabling the hearing to sign rather than the deaf to "hear". We argue that ATs should not be seen as "just" a tool for the Deaf but rather as a collaborative technology.},

abstract = {The notion of “movement qualities” is central in contemporary dance; it describes the manner in which a movement is executed. Movement qualities convey information revealing movement expressiveness; their use has strong potential for movement-based interaction with applications in arts, entertainment, education, or rehabilitation. The purpose of our research is to design and evaluate interactive reflexive visuals for movement qualities. The theoretical basis for this research is drawn from a collaboration with the members of the international dance company Emio Greco|PC to study their formalization of movement qualities. We designed a pedagogical interactive installation called Double Skin/Double Mind (DS/DM) for the analysis and visualization of movement qualities through physical model-based interactive renderings.In this article, we first evaluate dancers’ perception of the visuals as metaphors for movement qualities. This evaluation shows that, depending on the physical model parameterization, the visuals are capable of generating dynamic behaviors that the dancers associate with DS/DM movement qualities. Moreover, we evaluate dance students’ and professionals’ experience of the interactive visuals in the context of a dance pedagogical workshop and a professional dance training. The results of these evaluations show that the dancers consider the interactive visuals to be a reflexive system that encourages them to perform, improves their experience, and contributes to a better understanding of movement qualities. Our findings support research on interactive systems for real-time analysis and visualization of movement qualities, which open new perspectives in movement-based interaction design.},

abstract = {Collaborative crowd computing, e.g., human computation and crowdsourcing, involves a team of workers jointly solving tasks of varying difficulties. In such settings, the ability to manage the workflow based on workers' skills and task strains can improve output quality. However, many practical systems employ a simple additive scoring scheme to measure worker performance, and do not consider the task difficulty or worker interaction. Some prior works have looked at ways of measuring worker performance or task difficulty in collaborative settings, but usually assume sophisticated models. In our work, we address this question by taking a competitive perspective and leveraging the vast prior work on competitive games. We adapt TrueSkill's standard competitive model by treating the task as a fictitious worker that the team of humans jointly plays against. We explore two fast online approaches to estimate the worker and task ratings: (1) an ELO rating system, and (2) approximate inference with the Expectation Propagation algorithm. To assess the strengths and weaknesses of the various rating methods, we conduct a human study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk with a simulated ESP game. Our experimental design has the novel element of pairing a carefully designed bot with human workers; these encounters can be used, in turn, to generate a larger set of simulated encounters, yielding more data. Our analysis confirms that our ranking scheme performs consistently and robustly, and outperforms the traditional additive scheme in terms of predicted accuracy.},

We question whether current user-centered security techniques are adequate for this task and suggest that new thinking will be required.

abstract = {There is currently uncertainty in the research community as to how ICT can and should be designed in such a way that it can be convincingly integrated into the everyday lives of prison inmates. In this paper, we discuss a design fiction that closes this research gap. The descriptions and results of the study are purely fictitious. Excluded is the State of the Art as well as the description of the legal situation of prisons in Germany. The analysis of the fictional study data designed here thus refers to the real world in order to derive ethical guidelines and draw practical conclusions. It is our intention to use these results as a possible basis for further research. The paper presents results of an explorative study dealing with the design, development and evaluation of an AI-based Smart Mirror System, Prison AI 2.0, in a German prison. Prison AI 2.0 was developed for daily use and voluntarily tested by eight prisoners over a period of 12 months to gain insight into their individual and social impact, with an emphasis on its ability to actively support rehabilitation. Based on qualitative data, our findings suggest that intelligent AI-based devices can actually help promote such an outcome. Our results also confirm the valuable impact of (Psychosocial) ICT on the psychological, social and individual aspects of prison life, and in particular how prisoners used the Smart Mirror system to improve and maintain their cognitive, mental and physical state and to restore social interactions with the outside world. With the presentation of these results we want to initiate discussions about the use of ICT by prisoners in closed prisons in order to identify opportunities and risks.},

abstract = {Climate change is the defining challenge now facing our planet. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, as advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, requires rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in how governments, industries, and societies function by 2030. Computer Science plays an important role in these efforts, both in providing tools for greater understanding of climate science and in reducing the environmental costs of computing. It is vital for Computer Science students to understand how their chosen field can both exacerbate and mitigate the problem of climate change.We have reviewed the existing literature, interviewed leading experts, and held conversations at the ITiCSE 2019 conference, to identify how universities, departments, and CS educators can most effectively address climate change within Computer Science education. We find that the level of engagement with the issue is still low, and we discuss obstacles at the level of institutional, program and departmental support as well as faculty and student attitudes. We also report on successful efforts to date, and we identify responses, strategies, seed ideas, and resources to assist educators as they prepare their students for a world shaped by climate change.},

abstract = {Assisted living technologies may help people live independently while also—potentially—reducing health and care costs. But they are notoriously difficult to implement at scale and many devices are abandoned following initial adoption. We report findings from a study of global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices intended to support the independent living of people with cognitive impairment. Our aims were threefold: to understand (through ethnography) such individuals’ lived experience of GPS tracking; to facilitate (through action research) the customization and adaptation of technologies and care services to provide effective, ongoing support; and to explore the possibilities for a co-production methodology that would enable people with cognitive impairment and their families to work with professionals and technical designers to shape these devices and services to meet their particular needs in a sustainable way. We found that the articulation work needed for maintaining the GPS technology in “working order” was extensive and ongoing. This articulation work does not merely supplement formal procedures, a lot of it is needed to get round them, but it is also often invisible and thus its importance goes largely unrecognized. If GPS technologies are to be implemented at scale and sustainably, methods must be found to capitalize on the skills and tacit knowledge held within the care network (professional and lay) to resolve problems, improve device design, devise new service solutions, and foster organizational learning.},

However, studies addressing the industrial context are quite rare, and due to the diversity of machines, processes, tasks, personal motivations, teams and the specific organizational culture of companies, it is not sufficient to provide only consumption data. For an adequate consideration of these factors, detailed design guidelines and system concepts are currently missing. However, this study shows the potential that a common understanding of consumption data can emerge through suitable visualization to support everyday work and possibilities of data sharing. Therefore, we show exemplarily how a design can be derived from empirically collected requirements and how a system concept can look like that enrich current eco-feedback design research for the industrial context.},

abstract = {RISC-V is an open-source instruction set and now has been examined as a universal standard to unify the heterogeneous platforms. However, current research focuses primarily on the design and fabrication of general-purpose processors based on RISC-V, despite the fact that in the era of IoT (Internet of Things), the fusion of heterogeneous platforms should also take application-specific processors into account. Accordingly, this paper proposes a collaborative RISC-V multi-core system for Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a multi-core scheduling architecture for DNN acceleration is formulated and RISC-V is explored as the ISA of a multi-core system to bridge the gap between the memory and the DNN Processor in order to increase the entire system throughput. The experiment realizes a four-stage design of the RISC-V core, and further reveals that a multi-core design along with an appropriate scheduling algorithm can efficiently decrease the runtime and elevate the throughput. Moreover, the experiment also provides us with a constructive suggestion regarding the ideal proportion of the cores to Process Engines (PE), which provides us with significant assistance in building highly efficient AI System-on-Chips (SoCs) in resource-aware situations.},

We argue that instruction in SEO in undergraduate and graduate programs in technical communication prepares graduates for the interdisciplinary and agile profession they seek to enter and enables them to be successful in positions from information architect to technical editor. Our article details how studying and enacting SEO helps students to develop proficiencies and knowledge central to technical communication pedagogies, including technological literacies, an understanding of the interconnections between human and non-human actors in digital spaces, and the ethical concerns central to work within those spaces.

Our work using narrative methods has explored how university graduates make sense of their learning experiences and how these fit within their wider learning trajectories. In this paper, we discuss work we conducted with a group of a dozen students who, when first interviewed, were in the second half of their undergraduate education at Olin College of Engineering. All twelve participants were re-interviewed four years later, after they had graduated, using the same narrative protocol that asked them to describe their learning 'life' as if it was a book, and to identify and describe individual chapters of their experience. The pairs of interviews were analysed with respect to their form and their content. In regard to form, a classification of these repeated stories is derived. Thematic analysis of the content examines a) how students come to study and practice computing and b) the continuing, and changing influence of a university education over time, as students construct an individual sense of coherence.},

The chatbot use cases emerged primarily as the first line of support. The participants, especially the mothers, were enthusiastic with the opportunity to ask questions and get reliable answers. We also observed the influencing role of female relative, e.g. mothers-in-law, in breastfeeding practices. Our analysis of user information-seeking suggests that a majority of questions (88%) are of nature that can be answered by a chatbot application. We further observe that the queries are embedded deeply into myths and existing belief systems.

This paper presents an analysis of current research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions: the orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity, challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar areas and LA applications.},

We designed an interactive sound installation that supports kinesthetic awareness of a participant's micro-movements. The installation's interaction design uses continuous auditory feedback and leverages an adaptive mapping strategy, refining its sensitivity to increase sonic resolution at lower levels of movement activity. The installation uses field recordings as rich source materials to generate a sound environment that attunes to a participant's micro-movements. Through a qualitative study using a second-person interview technique, we gained nuanced insights into the participants' subjective experiences of the installation. These reveal consistent temporal patterns, as participants build on a gradual process of integration to increase the complexity and capacity of their kinesthetic awareness during interaction.},

abstract = {Text-rich heterogeneous information networks (text-rich HINs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Hypernymy, also known as is-a relation or subclass-of relation, lays in the core of many knowledge graphs and benefits many downstream applications. Existing methods of hypernymy discovery either leverage textual patterns to extract explicitly mentioned hypernym-hyponym pairs, or learn a distributional representation for each term of interest based its context. These approaches rely on statistical signals from the textual corpus, and their effectiveness would therefore be hindered when the signals from the corpus are not sufficient for all terms of interest. In this work, we propose to discover hypernymy in text-rich HINs, which can introduce additional high-quality signals. We develop a new framework, named HyperMine, that exploits multi-granular contexts and combines signals from both text and network without human labeled data. HyperMine extends the definition of "context" to the scenario of text-rich HIN. For example, we can define typed nodes and communities as contexts. These contexts encode signals of different granularities and we feed them into a hypernymy inference model. HyperMine learns this model using weak supervision acquired based on high-precision textual patterns. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperMine and the utility of modeling context granularity. We further show a case study that a high-quality taxonomy can be generated solely based on the hypernymy discovered by HyperMine.},

abstract = {The last decades have seen a growing interest and demand for community-centered collaborative systems and platforms. These systems and platforms aim to provide an environment in which users can collaboratively create, share, and manage resources. While offering attractive opportunities for online collaboration and information sharing, they also open several security and privacy issues. This has attracted several research efforts toward the design and implementation of novel access control solutions that can handle the complexity introduced by collaboration. Despite these efforts, transition to practice has been hindered by the lack of maturity of the proposed solutions. The access control mechanisms typically adopted by commercial collaborative systems like online social network websites and collaborative editing platforms, are still rather rudimentary and do not provide users with a sufficient control over their resources. This survey examines the growing literature on access control for collaborative systems centered on communities, and identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to facilitate the adoption of collaborative access control solutions in real-life settings. Based on the literature study, we delineate a roadmap for future research in the area of access control for community-centered collaborative systems.},

They facilitate understanding of human developers’ needs and activities, and thus can serve as a valuable resource to researchers designing software engineering tools. Furthermore, theories abstract beyond specific methods and tools to fundamental principles that can be applied to new situations. Toward filling this gap, we investigate the applicability and utility of Information Foraging Theory (IFT) for understanding information-intensive software engineering tasks, drawing upon literature in three areas: debugging, refactoring, and reuse. In particular, we focus on software engineering tools that aim to support information-intensive activities, that is, activities in which developers spend time seeking information. Regarding applicability, we consider whether and how the mathematical equations within IFT can be used to explain why certain existing tools have proven empirically successful at helping software engineers. Regarding utility, we applied an IFT perspective to identify recurring design patterns in these successful tools, and consider what opportunities for future research are revealed by our IFT perspective.},

For example, Wikipedia, one of the most visited platforms on the Web, hosts thousands of user-generated articles and undergoes 12 million edits/contributions per month. User-generated content is undoubtedly one of the keys to its success but also a hindrance to good quality. Although Wikipedia has established guidelines for the “perfect article,” authors find it difficult to assert whether their contributions comply with them and reviewers cannot cope with the ever-growing amount of articles pending review. Great efforts have been invested in algorithmic methods for automatic classification of Wikipedia articles (as featured or non-featured) and for quality flaw detection. Instead, our contribution is an interactive tool that combines automatic classification methods and human interaction in a toolkit, whereby experts can experiment with new quality metrics and share them with authors that need to identify weaknesses to improve a particular article. A design study shows that experts are able to effectively create complex quality metrics in a visual analytics environment. In turn, a user study evidences that regular users can identify flaws, as well as high-quality content based on the inspection of automatic quality scores.},

abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {Agile approaches to software development offer flexibility and autonomy to developers, while demanding discipline and attentiveness. At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger's Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm's history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.},

We present an exploration of modelling an example ubiquitous system, the Savannah game, using the mathematical formalism of bigraphs, which are based on a universal process algebra that encapsulates both dynamic and spatial behaviour of autonomous agents that interact and move among each other, or within each other. We establish a modelling approach based on four perspectives on ubiquitous systems—Computational, Physical, Human, and Technology—and explore how these interact with one another. We show how our model explains observed inconsistencies in user trials of Savannah, and then, how formal analysis reveals an incompleteness in design and guides extensions of the model and/or possible system re-design to resolve this.},

abstract = {Mirrors have been a core feature in ballet studios for over five hundred years. While physical mirrors provide real-time feedback, they do not inform dancers of their errors. Thus, technologies such as motion tracking have been used to augment what a physical mirror can provide. Current augmented mirrors, however, only implement one mode of communication, usually visual, and do not provide a holistic feedback to dancers that includes all the feedback elements commonly used in ballet classes. We conducted a mixed-method study with 16 novices and 16 expert dancers in which we compared two different modes of communication (visual and verbal), two different types of feedback (value and corrective) and two levels of guidance (mirror, or no mirror). Participants' ballet technique scores were evaluated by a remote teacher on eight ballet combinations (tendue, adagio, pirouette, saute, pli\'{e}, degage, frappe and battement tendue). We report quantitative and qualitative results that show how the level of guidance, mode of communication, and type of feedback, needs to be tuned in different ways for novices and experts.},

Existing telemetry solutions often face the dilemma between resource efficiency (i.e., low CPU, memory, and bandwidth overhead) and full accuracy (i.e., error-free and holistic measurement). We break this dilemma via a network-wide architectural design OmniMon, which simultaneously achieves resource efficiency and full accuracy in flow-level telemetry for large-scale data centers. OmniMon carefully coordinates the collaboration among different types of entities in the whole network to execute telemetry operations, such that the resource constraints of each entity are satisfied without compromising full accuracy. It further addresses consistency in network-wide epoch synchronization and accountability in error-free packet loss inference. We prototype OmniMon in DPDK and P4. Testbed experiments on commodity servers and Tofino switches demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniMon over state-of-the-art telemetry designs.},

abstract = {Model comparison has been widely used to support many tasks in model-driven software development. For this reason, many techniques of comparing them have been proposed in the last few decades. However, academia and industry have overlooked a classification of currently available approaches to the comparison of design models. Hence, a thorough understanding of state-of-the-art techniques remains limited and inconclusive. This article, therefore, focuses on providing a classification and a thematic analysis of studies on the comparison of software design models. We carried out a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer nine research questions. In total, 56 primary studies (out of 4,132) were selected from 10 widely recognized electronic databases after a careful filtering process. The main results are that a majority of the primary studies (1) provide coarse-grained techniques of the comparison of general-purpose diagrams, (2) adopt graphs as principal data structure and compare software design models considering structural properties only, (3) pinpoint commonalities and differences between software design models rather than assess their similarity, and (4) propose new techniques while neglecting the production of empirical knowledge from experimental studies. Finally, this article highlights some challenges and directions that can be explored in upcoming studies.},

These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

abstract = {The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to self-explain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

We investigate the usability of the proposed canvases with two social robot design case studies: a robot that played games online with teenage users and a librarian robot that guided users at a public library. We observe through participants’ feedback that the canvases have the advantages of (1) providing structure, clarity, and a clear process to the design; (2) encouraging designers and users to share their viewpoints to progress toward a shared one; and (3) providing an educational and enjoyable design experience for the teams.},

abstract = {Applications of artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) are dynamic and rapidly growing, and although multi-purpose, are particularly consequential in health care. One strategy for anticipating and addressing ethical challenges related to AI/ML for health care is co-design - or involvement of end users in design. Co-design has a diverse intellectual and practical history, however, and has been conceptualized in many different ways. Moreover, the unique features of AI/ML introduce challenges to co-design that are often underappreciated. This review summarizes the research literature on involvement in health care and design, and informed by critical data studies, examines the extent to which co-design as commonly conceptualized is capable of addressing the range of normative issues raised by AI/ML for health. We suggest that AI/ML technologies have amplified existing challenges related to co-design, and created entirely new challenges. We outline five co-design 'myths and misconceptions' related to AI/ML for health that form the basis for future research and practice. We conclude by suggesting that the normative strength of a co-design approach to AI/ML for health can be considered at three levels: technological, health care system, and societal. We also suggest research directions for a 'new era' of co-design capable of addressing these challenges.Link to full text: https://bit.ly/3yZrb3y},

abstract = {Despite growing calls for participation in AI design, there are to date few empirical studies of what these processes look like and how they can be structured for meaningful engagement with domain experts. In this paper, we examine a notable yet understudied AI design process in the legal domain that took place over a decade ago, the impact of which still informs legal automation efforts today. Specifically, we examine the design and evaluation activities that took place from 2006 to 2011 within the Text REtrieval Conference's (TREC) Legal Track, a computational research venue hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The Legal Track of TREC is notable in the history of AI research and practice because it relied on a range of participatory approaches to facilitate the design and evaluation of new computational techniques-in this case, for automating attorney document review for civil litigation matters. Drawing on archival research and interviews with coordinators of the Legal Track of TREC, our analysis reveals how an interactive simulation methodology allowed computer scientists and lawyers to become co-designers and helped bridge the chasm between computational research and real-world, high-stakes litigation practice. In analyzing this case from the recent past, our aim is to empirically ground contemporary critiques of AI development and evaluation and the calls for greater participation as a means to address them.},

abstract = {In Spain, the majority of university students are women, but the gender distribution in different fields of study is uneven and there are certain disciplines, as engineering and some experimental sciences where less than 30% are women. This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies. In this document we analyze the degree of introduction of the gender perspective in the AI grades and how to improve the gender competences of the students},

abstract = {The Participatory Design and End-User Programming for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) workshop aims to advance research on how to design systems that can be used by end users to program robots. There tends to be a fracture in HRI between the technical designers of robot programs (often engineers or computer scientists) and the actual users of such robots. Developers have the capabilities to program robots but often lack insights possessed by domain experts, sometimes leading to technically interesting but impractical systems. With this workshop, we aim to bridge two different methods often used individually within the wider HRI community to involve end users in robot program design: Participatory Design (PD) and End-User Programming (EUP). Both methods empower end users to co-produce robots addressing real-world needs. However, there have been limited opportunities to unite researchers who specialize in these areas and engage in mutual learning. We will address this shortcoming with a full-day workshop, which will put the PD and EUP communities in touch, inviting speakers from both sides and welcoming a wide range of publications from describing new end-user programming methods to compiling insights learned from conducting participatory design studies.},

PD methods broadly enable stakeholders of diverse backgrounds to inform new use cases for AI and the design of AI-based technologies that directly impact people's lives. Such participation can be vital for mitigating adverse implications of AI on society that are becoming increasingly apparent and pursuing more positive impact, especially to vulnerable populations. This panel brings together researchers who have, or are, conducting participatory design of AI systems across diverse subject areas. The goal of the panel is to elucidate similarities and differences, as well as successes and challenges, in how PD methods can be applied to Artificially Intelligent systems in practical and meaningful ways. The panel serves as an opportunity for the HCI research community to collectively reflect on opportunities for PD of AI to facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders, as well as persistent challenges to participatory AI design.},

abstract = {In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners as participants in co-designing the protocol for the world’s largest Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) project with children. Participatory Design – whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognised in design – can be very challenging, especially when involving children. The current COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups. Recent key barriers include social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional health risks to vulnerable children and their families. This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers). However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities. We invite the CCI community to examine Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19. Together, we offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities. This workshop builds on work conducted in a similar workshop in IDC 2020, and this year will focus on the planning and design of the protocol for the world’s largest DPD project with children.},

Framing the problem as a ‘wicked’ one, this study tackles the issue of transparency in the EnerCoach energy accounting tool through presenting a situated ethnography of the algorithmic system and exploring the issues and challenges of model transparency and post-hoc explainability therein. By engaging stakeholders through participatory design methodologies, both a conceptual understanding of the problem and material solutions thereof are developed and evaluated. The findings show the promising potential of participatory design methodologies to elevate users to a ‘critical audience’, and the solutions co-created by the study participants for the challenge of algorithmic transparency. The results also highlight the complexity of the problem: transparency of algorithmic systems must be understood as a multi-facetted and highly contextual, ‘wicked’ problem that requires diverse methodological interventions to reach ‘satisficing’ solutions.},

Involving end users in the design of robots is vital for developing effective, useful, acceptable and user-friendly products that meet expectations, needs, and preferences. This four-year international project developed and evaluated a home-based robot for mood stabilization and cognitive improvement in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and age-related health needs. The daily-care robot was developed in collaboration with experts, carers, relatives, and older adults, through six phases. Two phases were dedicated to cognitive stimulation games. This paper provides a summary of the participatory design and mixed-methods evaluation processes undertaken to develop, refine, and test the robot. The final robot and games were acceptable to older adults, and useful for delivering stimulating activities and providing reminders for medication, health and wellbeing checks. Personalization is required to optimize human-robot interaction, and imagery and speech should be consistent with local users. Functions should be personalizable to accommodate individual health needs and preferences. This project highlights the importance of participatory design and testing robotics in end-user environments, as technical issues associated with long-term use were uncovered. Recommendations for future development and the design of assistive health robots are made.},

Technology creators who do not fully consider how identity information is encoded in AI dialogue risk creating representational harms that negatively impact users’ interactions with the technology, particularly young users from groups marginalized in STEM education. One solution is to engage young users in Participatory Design of dialogue, pushing power away from the researcher and toward the young users. This positions users as technology creators who understand AI language as a technosocial phenomenon and who have their own perspective about how identity is best portrayed in AI language.

Despite their benefits, recent studies of ML teams and our interviews with practitioners (n=9) showed that ML interfaces have limited adoption in practice. While existing ML interfaces are effective for specific tasks, they are not designed to be reused, explored, and shared by multiple stakeholders in cross-functional teams. To enable analysis and communication between different ML practitioners, we designed and implemented Symphony, a framework for composing interactive ML interfaces with task-specific, data-driven components that can be used across platforms such as computational notebooks and web dashboards. We developed Symphony through participatory design sessions with 10 teams (n=31), and discuss our findings from deploying Symphony to 3 production ML projects at Apple. Symphony helped ML practitioners discover previously unknown issues like data duplicates and blind spots in models while enabling them to share insights with other stakeholders.},

We demonstrate an alternative approach to online memorials that blends participatory memory with participatory design through remembrance artifacts that represent ideas for gun violence prevention technologies that could have prevented the tragedy and that may prevent future tragedies. We demonstrate participatory memory + design with our memorial called the OUrchive that supports retrospective and prospective reflection on the Oxford High School shooting through designing new use cases for AI to prevent mass shootings. Early community involvement suggests that the OUrchive supports personal reconciliation with tragedy by channeling trauma towards public discourse about potential solutions to gun violence.},

abstract = {Machine learning technologies are increasingly being applied in many different domains in the real world. As autonomous machines and black-box algorithms begin making decisions previously entrusted to humans, great academic and public interest has been spurred to provide explanations that allow users to understand the decision-making process of the machine learning model. Besides explanations, Interactive Machine Learning (IML) seeks to leverage user feedback to iterate on an ML solution to correct errors and align decisions with those of the users. Despite the rise in explainable AI (XAI) and Interactive Machine Learning (IML) research, the links between interactivity, explanations, and trust have not been comprehensively studied in the machine learning literature. Thus, in this study, we develop and evaluate an explanation-driven interactive machine learning (XIML) system with the Tic-Tac-Toe game as a use case to understand how a XIML mechanism improves users’ satisfaction with the machine learning system. We explore different modalities to support user feedback through visual or rules-based corrections. Our online user study (n = 199) supports the hypothesis that allowing interactivity within this XIML system causes participants to be more satisfied with the system, while visual explanations play a less prominent (and somewhat unexpected) role. Finally, we leverage a user-centric evaluation framework to create a comprehensive structural model to clarify how subjective system aspects, which represent participants’ perceptions of the implemented interaction and visualization mechanisms, mediate the influence of these mechanisms on the system’s user experience.},

These organizations are increasingly applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care. Unfortunately, both health care systems and AI are confronted with a lack of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). This short paper focuses on the importance of integrating EDI concepts throughout the life cycle of AI in health. We discuss the risks that the lack of EDI in the design, development and implementation of AI-based tools might have on the already marginalized communities and populations in the healthcare setting. Moreover, we argue that integrating EDI principles and practice throughout the lifecycle of AI in health has an important role in achieving health equity for all populations. Further research needs to be conducted to explore how studies in AI-health have integrated.},

abstract = {This paper critiques popular modes of participation in design practice and machine learning. It examines three existing kinds of participation in design practice and machine learning participation as work, participation as consultation, and as participation as justice – to argue that the machine learning community must become attuned to possibly exploitative and extractive forms of community involvement and shift away from the prerogatives of context independent scalability. Cautioning against “participation washing”, it argues that the notion of “participation” should be expanded to acknowledge more subtle, and possibly exploitative, forms of community involvement in participatory machine learning design. Specifically, it suggests that it is imperative to recognize design participation as work; to ensure that participation as consultation is context-specific; and that participation as justice must be genuine and long term. The paper argues that such a development can only be scaffolded by a new epistemology around design harms, including, but not limited to, in machine learning. To facilitate such a development, the paper suggests developing we argue that developing a cross-sectoral database of design participation failures that is cross-referenced with socio-structural dimensions and highlights “edge cases” that can and must be learned from.},

To this aim, we review related work in ML, HCI, design, new interfaces for musical expression, and computational art, and introduce two practice-based studies of music performance and robotic art based on interactive machine learning tools, with the hope of revealing the computational materiality of ML, and the potential of embodiment to craft prototypes of ML that reconfigure conceptual or technical approaches to ML. We derive five interference conditions for such art-based ML prototypes—situational whole, small data, shallow model, learnable algorithm, and somaesthetic behaviour—and describe their widening of design and engineering practices of ML prototyping. Finally, we sketch how a process of intra-active machine learning could complement that of interactive machine learning to take materiality as an entry point for ML design within HCI.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how intersectional critical theoretical concepts from social sciences and humanities research can be worked with in machine learning systems design. It does so by presenting a case study of a series of speculative design workshops, conducted in 2021. These workshops drew on intersectional feminist methodologies to construct interdisciplinary interventions in the design of machine learning systems, towards more inclusive, accountable, and contextualized systems design. The concepts of “situating/situated knowledges”, "figuration", "diffraction", and “critical fabulation/speculation” were taken up as theoretical and methodological tools for concept-led design workshops. This paper presents the design framework of the workshops and highlights tensions and possibilities with regards to interdisciplinary machine learning systems design towards more inclusive, contextualized, and accountable systems. It discusses the role that critical theoretical concepts can play in a design process and shows how such concepts can work as methodological tools that nonetheless require an open-ended experimental space to function. It presents insights and discussion points regarding what it means to work with critical intersectional knowledge that is inextricably connected to its historical and socio-political roots, and how this reframes what it might mean to design fair and accountable systems.},

We found that while there are manifold technical approaches, these often focus on ML experts and are evaluated in decontextualized empirical studies. We hypothesized that participatory design research may support the understanding of stakeholders' situated sense-making in our project, yet, found guidance regarding ML interpretability inexhaustive. Building on philosophy of technology, we formulated explanation strategies as an empirical-analytical lens explicating how technical explanations mediate the contextual preferences concerning people's interpretations. In this paper, we contribute a report of our proof-of-concept use of explanation strategies to analyze a co-design workshop with non-ML experts, methodological implications for participatory design research, design implications for explanations for non-ML experts and suggest further investigation of technological mediation theories in the ML interpretability space.},

One of the most difficult challenges to address is supporting the fluctuating accessibility needs of people with dementia, which vary with the specific type of dementia and the progression of the condition. Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance. In this paper, we present future directions for the design of AI-based systems to personalize an interface for dementia-related changes in different types of memory, along with expectations for AI interactions with the user with dementia.},

abstract = {Although sharing multimedia content on online social networks (OSNs) has many benefits, publishing photos or videos of other people—without obtaining permission—can cause multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs). Early studies developed technical solutions and dissuasive approaches to address MPCs. However, none of these studies involved, in the design process, the OSN users who have experienced MPCs. Hence, they possibly overlooked the valuable experiences these individuals have accrued. To fill this gap, we recruited participants specifically from this population of users, and we involved them in participatory design sessions to find solutions to reduce the incidence of MPCs. To frame the activities of our participants, we borrowed terminology and concepts from a well-known framework used in the justice systems. Over the course of several design sessions, our participants designed 10 solutions to mitigate MPCs. The designed solutions are based on different mechanisms, including preventing MPCs from occurring, dissuading users from sharing, resolving the conflicts, and educating users about community standards. We discuss the open design and research opportunities suggested by the designed solutions and contribute an ideal workflow that synthesizes the best of each solution. We contribute to the innovation of privacy-enhancing technologies to limit the incidence of MPCs in OSNs.},

The proposed DI is distinct from tutors, chatbots, recommenders and other similar systems since they seek to diverge from a solution (rather than converge towards one) by encouraging consideration of other possibilities. We develop a conceptual design of the system, then present examples from deep Convolution Neural Networks[1,7] learning models. The first example shows results from a model that was trained on an open-source dataset (publicly available online) of a community technical support chat transcripts, while the second one was trained on a design-focused dataset obtained from transcripts of experts engaged in engineering design problem solving (unavailable publicly). Based on the results from these models, we propose the necessary improvements on models and training datasets that must be resolved in order to achieve usable and reliable collaborative text/voice systems that fall in this class of AI systems.},

Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.},

abstract = {Thousands of offshore oil and gas structures worldwide are approaching the end of their operating lifespan. Decommissioning processes are expensive and normally take years to finish as various options need to be analysed based on numerous stakeholders’ preferences. Despite recent and significant progress in machine learning and data-driven applications in the oil and gas industry, very little work has been done in the area of using machine learning to inform the decommissioning processes and operations. This can be attributed to the lack of relevant public datasets with sufficient samples. In this paper, we present a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset comprised of 708 real samples extracted from over a hundred company proposals and reports. A supervised learning algorithm was applied to the dataset to predict the decommissioning option. Experiments and results suggest that a machine learning approach can greatly help shorten the traditional analysis process while providing decent accuracy. The classification results of this work serve as a baseline to motivate further experiments and enable the research community to broaden and advance the knowledge in this prominent and timely topic.},

abstract = {Practitioners from diverse occupations and backgrounds are increasingly using machine learning (ML) methods. Nonetheless, studies on ML Practitioners typically draw populations from Big Tech and academia, as researchers have easier access to these communities. Through this selection bias, past research often excludes the broader, lesser-resourced ML community---for example, practitioners working at startups, at non-tech companies, and in the public sector. These practitioners share many of the same ML development difficulties and ethical conundrums as their Big Tech counterparts; however, their experiences are subject to additional under-studied challenges stemming from deploying ML with limited resources, increased existential risk, and absent access to in-house research teams. We contribute a qualitative analysis of 17 interviews with stakeholders from organizations which are less represented in prior studies. We uncover a number of tensions which are introduced or exacerbated by these organizations' resource constraints---tensions between privacy and ubiquity, resource management and performance optimization, and access and monopolization. Increased academic focus on these practitioners can facilitate a more holistic understanding of ML limitations, and so is useful for prescribing a research agenda to facilitate responsible ML development for all.},

Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.},

Existing ML learning tools focus primarily on the first two areas, and to a lesser degree the third. In order to address this, we designed VotestratesML; a tool allowing K-12 students to build models and make predictions based on real world voting data. Based on in-situ deployments of VotestratesML, we reflect on opportunities and challenges for engaging K-12 students in understanding and reflecting on ML. We find that the design of VotestratesML supports students’ engagement in all three areas of ML, through grounding ML in a known subject area and allowing for collaboration and competition.},

abstract = {Self-tracking can help personalize self-management interventions for chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), but reflecting on personal data requires motivation and literacy. Machine learning (ML) methods can identify patterns, but a key challenge is making actionable suggestions based on personal health data. We introduce GlucoGoalie, which combines ML with an expert system to translate ML output into personalized nutrition goal suggestions for individuals with T2D. In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants’ self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts. We discuss implications for ML-based interventions and the need for systems that offer more interactivity, feedback, and negotiation.},

This opens up new ways of collaboratively designing vibrotactile patterns both in collocated as well as in remote settings. We evaluate TactJam in a two-part distributed online workshop, exploring the design of on-body tactons. Participants were able to successfully use TactJam to learn about tacton design. We present an overview of mappings between tactons and their associated concepts before comparing the results of tactons created using solely a GUI and tactons created through experimenting with placements directly on the body. Conducting both parts of the workshop separately highlighted the importance of designing directly with bodies: less implicit assumptions were made, and designs were guided by personal experience. We reflect on these results and close on deliberations for the future development of TactJam.},

Findings indicate that participants want social matching apps to augment women's abilities for self-protection, reflected in three new app roles: 1) the cloaking device, through which the social matching app helps women dynamically manage visibility to geographically nearby users, 2) the informant, through which the app helps women predict risk of harm associated with a recommended social opportunity, and 3) the guardian, through which the app monitors a user's safety during face-to-face meetings and augments their response to risk.},

In this paper, we eschew prior expertise- and role-based categorizations of interpretability stakeholders in favor of a more granular framework that decouples stakeholders’ knowledge from their interpretability needs. We characterize stakeholders by their formal, instrumental, and personal knowledge and how it manifests in the contexts of machine learning, the data domain, and the general milieu. We additionally distill a hierarchical typology of stakeholder needs that distinguishes higher-level domain goals from lower-level interpretability tasks. In assessing the descriptive, evaluative, and generative powers of our framework, we find our more nuanced treatment of stakeholders reveals gaps and opportunities in the interpretability literature, adds precision to the design and comparison of user studies, and facilitates a more reflexive approach to conducting this research.},

abstract = {Unintended biases in machine learning (ML) models have the potential to introduce undue discrimination and exacerbate social inequalities. The research community has proposed various technical and qualitative methods intended to assist practitioners in assessing these biases. While frameworks for identifying the risks of harm due to unintended biases have been proposed, they have not yet been operationalised into practical tools to assist industry practitioners.In this paper, we link prior work on bias assessment methods to phases of a standard organisational risk management process (RMP), noting a gap in measures for helping practitioners identify bias- related risks. Targeting this gap, we introduce a bias identification methodology and questionnaire, illustrating its application through a real-world, practitioner-led use case. We validate the need and usefulness of the questionnaire through a survey of industry practitioners, which provides insights into their practical requirements and preferences. Our results indicate that such a questionnaire is helpful for proactively uncovering unexpected bias concerns, particularly where it is easy to integrate into existing processes, and facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders. Ultimately, the effective end-to-end management of ML risks requires a more targeted identification of potential harm and its sources, so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be formulated. Towards this, our questionnaire provides a practical means to assist practitioners in identifying bias-related risks.},

abstract = {In conventional software development, user experience (UX) designers and engineers collaborate through separation of concerns (SoC): designers create human interface specifications, and engineers build to those specifications. However, we argue that Human-AI systems thwart SoC because human needs must shape the design of the AI interface, the underlying AI sub-components, and training data. How do designers and engineers currently collaborate on AI and UX design? To find out, we interviewed 21 industry professionals (UX researchers, AI engineers, data scientists, and managers) across 14 organizations about their collaborative work practices and associated challenges. We find that hidden information encapsulated by SoC challenges collaboration across design and engineering concerns. Practitioners describe inventing ad-hoc representations exposing low-level design and implementation details (which we characterize as leaky abstractions) to “puncture” SoC and share information across expertise boundaries. We identify how leaky abstractions are employed to collaborate at the AI-UX boundary and formalize a process of creating and using leaky abstractions.},

abstract = {Research in artificial intelligence (AI) for social good presupposes some definition of social good, but potential definitions have been seldom suggested and never agreed upon. The normative question of what AI for social good research should be "for" is not thoughtfully elaborated, or is frequently addressed with a utilitarian outlook that prioritizes the needs of the majority over those who have been historically marginalized, brushing aside realities of injustice and inequity. We argue that AI for social good ought to be assessed by the communities that the AI system will impact, using as a guide the capabilities approach, a framework to measure the ability of different policies to improve human welfare equity. Furthermore, we lay out how AI research has the potential to catalyze social progress by expanding and equalizing capabilities. We show how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for the design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework we introduce called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project. We conclude by providing an incomplete set of guiding questions for carrying out such participatory AI research in a way that elicits and respects a community's own definition of social good.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are quickly becoming pervasive in ways that impact the lives of all humans across the globe. In an effort to make otherwise ”black box” AI/ML systems more understandable, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has arisen with the goal of developing algorithms, toolkits, frameworks, and other techniques that enable people to comprehend, trust, and manage AI systems. However, although XAI is a rapidly growing area of research, most of the work has focused on contexts in the Global North, and little is known about if or how XAI techniques have been designed, deployed, or tested with communities in the Global South. This gap is concerning, especially in light of rapidly growing enthusiasm from governments, companies, and academics to use AI/ML to “solve” problems in the Global South. Our paper contributes the first systematic review of XAI research in the Global South, providing an early look at emerging work in the space. We identified 16 papers from 15 different venues that targeted a wide range of application domains. All of the papers were published in the last three years. Of the 16 papers, 13 focused on applying a technical XAI method, all of which involved the use of (at least some) data that was local to the context. However, only three papers engaged with or involved humans in the work, and only one attempted to deploy their XAI system with target users. We close by reflecting on the current state of XAI research in the Global South, discussing data and model considerations for building and deploying XAI systems in these regions, and highlighting the need for human-centered approaches to XAI in the Global South.},

By considering multiple perspectives on care in older adulthood, we will speculate on the role of technologies within future ecosystems of care, where care is the concerted and organising principle.},

There has recently been an increased interest into the potentials and challenges of creative collaborations between humans and AI, however, there have not been many practical implementations of co-creative systems. We argue that by designing co-creative systems to support the specific kind of creative design work in hackathons, valuable contributions can be made in the context of an overlooked aspect in interaction design; how to support fast design thinking. The specificity of hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea generation, decision-making, and prototyping, which ideally ends in a functioning and novel prototype. Specifically, we identify three key characteristics of hackathon participation, and for each characteristic we discuss how they may model Human-AI interaction in the context of co-creative systems for fast design thinking. The contribution of this paper is to provide future research on co-creative systems with inspiration grounded in the parallels between aspects of AI and key characteristics of hackathon participation.},

We analyse two design cases: a short-term hackathon and a long-term design process. We argue that the different temporalities of design activities configure decision making — and thereby power — and that both short- and long-term design processes differ in the ways of engaging people in designing technology: Decisions on values and concepts are prioritised in long-term design processes, decisions about implementing the vision are prioritised in short-term design processes, decisions requiring negotiations with the outside world are structurally limited in short-term design processes, non-decisions in short term design processes are pragmatic and habitual in long-term design processes.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Children are stakeholders of robotic technologies who deserve to have their voices heard in the design process just as much as adult stakeholders. This is especially true for robotic technologies explicitly designed for child-robot interaction, in areas like education, healthcare, and therapy. Researchers face the challenge of cultivating children's critical awareness on the design of robots and accompanying ethical concerns, as the types of exercises typically used to engage with adult stakeholders can be ineffective with children. This requires developmentally appropriate methods for understanding children's perspectives that also address the imbalanced power dynamics between children and adults, such that children feel comfortable sharing their ideas. In this work, we demonstrate that participatory design research techniques already accepted in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) community can fulfill this purpose. Specifically, through the design and analysis of two co-design workshops with children of different ages at a school in Denver, Colorado, we demonstrate that co-design workshops can be used to effectively understand how children make sense of robotic technologies and to facilitate children's critical reflection on the ethical dilemmas surrounding their own relationships with robots.},

abstract = {What does it mean for a generative AI model to be explainable? The emergent discipline of explainable AI (XAI) has made great strides in helping people understand discriminative models. Less attention has been paid to generative models that produce artifacts, rather than decisions, as output. Meanwhile, generative AI (GenAI) technologies are maturing and being applied to application domains such as software engineering. Using scenario-based design and question-driven XAI design approaches, we explore users’ explainability needs for GenAI in three software engineering use cases: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. We conducted 9 workshops with 43 software engineers in which real examples from state-of-the-art generative AI models were used to elicit users’ explainability needs. Drawing from prior work, we also propose 4 types of XAI features for GenAI for code and gathered additional design ideas from participants. Our work explores explainability needs for GenAI for code and demonstrates how human-centered approaches can drive the technical development of XAI in novel domains.},

abstract = {Motivated by the extensive documented disparate harms of artificial intelligence (AI), many recent practitioner-facing reflective tools have been created to promote responsible AI development. However, the use of such tools internally by technology development firms addresses responsible AI as an issue of closed-door compliance rather than a matter of public concern. Recent advocate and activist efforts intervene in AI as a public policy problem, inciting a growing number of cities to pass bans or other ordinances on AI and surveillance technologies. In support of this broader ecology of political actors, we present a set of reflective tools intended to increase public participation in technology advocacy for AI policy action. To this end, the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit (the AEKit) provides a practical policy-facing definition of AI, a flowchart for assessing technologies against that definition, a worksheet for decomposing AI systems into constituent parts, and a list of probing questions that can be posed to vendors, policy-makers, or government agencies. The AEKit carries an action-orientation towards political encounters between community groups in the public and their representatives, opening up the work of AI reflection and remediation to multiple points of intervention. Unlike current reflective tools available to practitioners, our toolkit carries with it a politics of community participation and activism.},

Based on this understanding, we discuss opportunities for supporting multidisciplinary collaborations and aligning individual health needs with collaborative co-design activities.},

HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on explainability of advanced algorithms. However, there are only few AI-systems based on machine learning algorithms that make it to the real world and everyday care. This challenging move has been named the “last mile” of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen learnings from involving users in the design or use of AI-based systems. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods, for transitioning from development to implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on healthcare AI in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts of AI in healthcare.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

This paper investigates the data science practices and design narratives that underlie AI-mediated behavioral health through the situational analysis of three natural language processing (NLP) training datasets. Examining datasets as a sociotechnical system inextricably connected to particular social worlds, discourses, and infrastructural arrangements, we identify several misalignments between the technical project of dataset construction and benchmarking (a current focus of AI research in the behavioral health domain) and the social complexity of behavioral health. Our study contributes to a growing critical CSCW literature of AI systems by articulating the sensitizing concept ofdisordering datasets that aims to productively trouble dominant logics of AI/ML applications in behavioral health, and also support researchers and designers in reflecting on their roles and responsibilities working within this emerging and sensitive design space.},

In response to sociotechnical challenges in the use of these models, designers and researchers have taken widely divergent positions on how formal models incorporating aspects of human values should be used: encouraging their use, moving away from them, or ignoring the normative consequences altogether. In this paper, we seek to resolve these divergent positions by identifying the main conceptual limits of formal modeling, and develop four reflexive values--value fidelity, appropriate accuracy, value legibility, and value contestation--vital for incorporating human values adequately into formal models. We then provide a brief methodology for reflexively designing formal models incorporating human values.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, human trafficking (where individuals are forcibly exploited for the profits of another) has seen increased attention from the artificial intelligence (AI) community. Clear focus on the ethical risks of this research is critical given that those risks are disproportionately born by already vulnerable populations. To understand and subsequently address these risks, we conducted a systematic literature review of computing research leveraging AI to combat human trafficking and apply a framework using principles from international human rights law to categorize ethical risks. This paper uncovers a number of ethical tensions including bias endemic in datasets, privacy risks stemming from data collection and reporting, and issues concerning potential misuse. We conclude by highlighting four suggestions for future research: broader use of participatory design; engaging with other forms of trafficking; developing best practices for harm prevention; and including transparent ethics disclosures in research. We find that there are significant gaps in what aspects of human trafficking researchers have focused on. Most research to date focuses on aiding criminal investigations in cases of sex trafficking, but more work is needed to support other anti-trafficking activities like supporting survivors, adequately address labor trafficking, and support more diverse survivor populations including transgender and nonbinary individuals.},

To support designers who aim to engage in a participatory design process in EMS environments, we created and evaluated the Contextual Secondary Video Toolkit (CSVT). This method uses secondary video material and design cards that allow domain experts to identify and prioritise challenges in their work environment and generate design ideas that address them. We illustrate the effects of the CSVT on design processes by analysing four workshops during which aeromedical EMS staff explored the potential of augmented reality to support their work. Our results indicate that the CSVT can support reflection about work practices, aid the generation of design ideas, and facilitate genuine participation. Furthermore, our data indicates that the use of secondary video in design projects is appropriate and even has certain advantages compared to primary field video.},

Recent work has started to investigate how humans judge fairness and how to support machine learning experts in making their AI models fairer. Drawing inspiration from an Explainable AI approach called explanatory debugging used in interactive machine learning, our work explores designing interpretable and interactive human-in-the-loop interfaces that allow ordinary end-users without any technical or domain background to identify potential fairness issues and possibly fix them in the context of loan decisions. Through workshops with end-users, we co-designed and implemented a prototype system that allowed end-users to see why predictions were made, and then to change weights on features to “debug” fairness issues. We evaluated the use of this prototype system through an online study. To investigate the implications of diverse human values about fairness around the globe, we also explored how cultural dimensions might play a role in using this prototype. Our results contribute to the design of interfaces to allow end-users to be involved in judging and addressing AI fairness through a human-in-the-loop approach.},

abstract = {Participatory approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are gaining momentum: the increased attention comes partly with the view that participation opens the gateway to an inclusive, equitable, robust, responsible and trustworthy AI. Among other benefits, participatory approaches are essential to understanding and adequately representing the needs, desires and perspectives of historically marginalized communities. However, there currently exists lack of clarity on what meaningful participation entails and what it is expected to do. In this paper we first review participatory approaches as situated in historical contexts as well as participatory methods and practices within the AI and ML pipeline. We then introduce three case studies in participatory AI. Participation holds the potential for beneficial, emancipatory and empowering technology design, development and deployment while also being at risk for concerns such as cooptation and conflation with other activities. We lay out these limitations and concerns and argue that as participatory AI/ML becomes in vogue, a contextual and nuanced understanding of the term as well as consideration of who the primary beneficiaries of participatory activities ought to be constitute crucial factors to realizing the benefits and opportunities that participation brings.},

abstract = {As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.},

This paper presents results from a participatory research aimed at co-designing with science teachers a learning analytics tool that will assist them in implementing a personalized pedagogy in blended learning contexts. The development process included three stages. In the first, we interviewed a group of teachers to identify where and how personalized instruction may be integrated into their teaching practices. This yielded a clustering-based personalization strategy. Next, we designed a mock-up of a learning analytics tool that supports this strategy and worked with another group of teachers to define an ‘explainable learning analytics’ scheme that explains each cluster in a way that is both pedagogically meaningful and can be generated automatically. Third, we developed an AI algorithm that supports this ‘explainable clusters’ pedagogy and conducted a controlled experiment that evaluated its contribution to teachers’ ability to plan personalized learning sequences. The planned sequences were evaluated in a blinded fashion by an expert, and the results demonstrated that the experimental group – teachers who received the clusters with the explanations – designed sequences that addressed the difficulties exhibited by different groups of students better than those designed by teachers who received the clusters without explanations. The main contribution of this study is twofold. First, it presents an effective personalization approach that fits blended learning in the science classroom, which combines a real-time clustering algorithm with an explainable-AI scheme that can automatically build pedagogically meaningful explanations from item-level meta-data (Q Matrix). Second, it demonstrates how such an end-to-end learning analytics solution can be built with teachers through a co-design process and highlights the types of knowledge that teachers add to system-provided analytics in order to apply them to their local context. As a practical contribution, this process informed the design of a new learning analytics tool that was integrated into a free online learning platform that is being used by more than 1000 science teachers.},

abstract = {Sign language datasets are essential to developing many sign language technologies. In particular, datasets are required for training artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. Though the idea of using AI/ML for sign languages is not new, technology has now advanced to a point where developing such sign language technologies is becoming increasingly tractable. This critical juncture provides an opportunity to be thoughtful about an array of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) considerations. Sign language datasets typically contain recordings of people signing, which is highly personal. The rights and responsibilities of the parties involved in data collection and storage are also complex and involve individual data contributors, data collectors or owners, and data users who may interact through a variety of exchange and access mechanisms. Deaf community members (and signers, more generally) are also central stakeholders in any end applications of sign language data. The centrality of sign language to deaf culture identity, coupled with a history of oppression, makes usage by technologists particularly sensitive. This piece presents many of these issues that characterize working with sign language AI datasets, based on the authors’ experiences living, working, and studying in this space.},

There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.},

abstract = {Assistive technologies for older adults (age tech) may support individuals in living a mostly independent life in their own home environment for as long as possible. Especially age tech based on artificial intelligence (AI)-applications may enable a personalization of health and care services and facilitate quality of life. These technologies collect and process large amounts of individual data generated in the daily life and home environment of older adults through various sensors, monitor technologies, and smart wearables. Due to their focus on individual data, these technologies may be tools for tailoring health and care services to the individual needs and benefits of older adults. However, AI-based age tech comes with ethical issues linked to complexity management, i.e. the set of technical means and strategies for dealing with complex or ambiguous data, e.g. user characteristics or behavioral data. Algorithmic standardization might thus conflict with the goal of personalization. In this paper, I identify the crucial ethics issues related to AI-based age tech. I also discuss strategies for dealing with these issues and the fundamental trade-off between complexity management and the personalization of care services through AI-based age tech},

Without appropriate ethical and regulatory frameworks there is a risk that decades of advances in human rights and civil liberties may be undermined. This paper proposes an approach to data curation for AI, grounded in feminist epistemology and informed by critical theories of race and feminist principles. The objective of this approach is to support critical evaluation of the social dynamics of power embedded in data for AI systems. We propose a set of fundamental guiding principles for ethical data curation that address the social construction of knowledge, call for inclusion of subjugated and new forms of knowledge, support critical evaluation of theoretical concepts within data and recognise the reflexive nature of knowledge. In developing this ethical framework for data curation, we aim to contribute to a virtue ethics for AI and ensure protection of fundamental and human rights.},

In this study, we conduct a series of participatory design workshops with participants from communities that have experienced problems with social media content moderation in the past. Together with participants, we explore the idea of designing for contestability in content moderation and find that users' designs suggest three fruitful, practical avenues: adding representation, improving communication, and designing with compassion. We conclude with design recommendations drawn from participants' proposals, and reflect on the challenges that remain.},

This article identifies four design principles to address this challenge and applies them in a real-world implementation: cloud-based robot control, a modular design, one common knowledge base for all applications, and hybrid artificial intelligence for decision making and reasoning. The control architecture for this robot includes a common Knowledge-base (ontologies), Data-base, “Hybrid Artificial Brain” (dialogue manager, action selection and explainable AI), Activities Centre (Timeline, Quiz, Break and Sort, Memory, Tip of the Day,  ( ldots  ) ), Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA, i.e., robot and avatar), and Dashboards (for authoring and monitoring the interaction). Further, the ECA is integrated with an expandable set of (mobile) health applications. The resulting system is a Personal Assistant for a healthy Lifestyle (PAL), which supports diabetic children with self-management and educates them on health-related issues (48 children, aged 6–14, recruited via hospitals in the Netherlands and in Italy). It is capable of autonomous interaction “in the wild” for prolonged periods of time without the need for a “Wizard-of-Oz” (up until 6 months online). PAL is an exemplary system that provides personalised, stable and diverse, long-term human-robot interaction.},

I present preliminary results focused on caseworker's perception of the value of AI in job placement, and find documentation plays a central role in collaboration in casework.

Facial recognition technology has been demonstrated to be more likely to misidentify women and minoritized people. This risk, among others, has elevated facial recognition into policy discussions across the country, where many jurisdictions have already passed bans on its use. Whereas scholarship on the disparate impacts of algorithmic systems is growing, general public awareness of this set of problems is limited in part by the illegibility of machine learning systems to non-specialists. Inspired by discussions with community organizers advocating for tech fairness issues, we created the Face Mis-ID Demo to reveal the algorithmic functions behind facial recognition technology and to demonstrate its risks to policymakers and members of the community. In this paper, we share the design process behind this interactive demo, its form and function, and the design decisions that honed its accessibility, toward its use for improving legibility of algorithmic systems and awareness of the sources of their disparate impacts.},

In this work, we introduce a novel paper reading experience that integrates relevant information about follow-on work directly into a paper, allowing readers to learn about newer papers and see how a paper is discussed by its citing papers in the context of the reference paper. We built a tool, called CiteRead, that implements the following three contributions: 1) automated techniques for selecting important citing papers, building on results from a formative study we conducted, 2) an automated process for localizing commentary provided by citing papers to a place in the reference paper, and 3) an interactive experience that allows readers to seamlessly alternate between the reference paper and information from citing papers (e.g., citation sentences), placed in the margins. Based on a user study with 12 scientists, we found that in comparison to having just a list of citing papers and their citation sentences, the use of CiteRead while reading allows for better comprehension and retention of information about follow-on work.},

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.},

While some prior work has explored impacted stakeholders’ concerns with current uses of data-driven predictive risk models (PRMs), less work has asked stakeholders whether such tools ought to be used in the first place. In this work, we conducted a set of seven design workshops with 35 stakeholders who have been impacted by the child welfare system or who work in it to understand their beliefs and concerns around PRMs, and to engage them in imagining new uses of data and technologies in the child welfare system. We found that participants worried current PRMs perpetuate or exacerbate existing problems in child welfare. Participants suggested new ways to use data and data-driven tools to better support impacted communities and suggested paths to mitigate possible harms of these tools. Participants also suggested low-tech or no-tech alternatives to PRMs to address problems in child welfare. Our study sheds light on how researchers and designers can work in solidarity with impacted communities, possibly to circumvent or oppose child welfare agencies.},

By reflecting on the multi-linguistic, social, and cultural challenges conducting workshops across geographic locations, we discuss how cultural nuances influenced co-design workshops and artefacts.

abstract = {Voice-Activated Artificial Intelligence (VAI) is increasingly ubiquitous, whether appearing as context-specific conversational assistants or more personalised and generalised personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri. CSCW and other fields have regularly studied the (positive and negative) social consequences of VAI design and deployment. One particular focus has been questions of gender, and the implications that the (often-feminine) gendering of VAIs has for societal norms and user experiences. Studies into this have largely elided transgender (trans) existences; the few exceptions to this operate largely from an external and predetermined idea of trans and/or non-binary user needs, centered on representation. In this study, we undertook a series of qualitative interviews with trans and/or non-binary users of VAIs to explore their experiences and needs. Our results show that these needs are far more than simply improvements to representation, and that users raise substantial concerns around the underlying framing of gender by even well-intentioned developers, the privacy and safety implications of ubiquitous VAI, and the motivations of the vast for-profit companies that deploy much of this technology. We provide both immediate recommendations for designers and researchers seeking to create trans-inclusive VAIs, and wider, critical proposals for how we as researchers go about assessing technological systems and appropriate points of intervention.},

abstract = {Ranging from subtle to overt, unintentional to systemic, navigating racism is additional everyday work for many people. Yet the needs of people who experience racism have been overlooked as a fertile ground for better technology. Through a series of workshops we call Foundational Fiction, we engaged BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) in participatory design to identify qualities of technology that can support people coping before, during, and after a racist interaction. Participants developed storyboards for digital tools that offer advice, predict consequences, identify racist remarks and intervene, educate both targets and perpetrators about interpersonal and systemic racism, and more. In the paper we present our workshop method utilizing interactive fiction, participants’ design concepts, prevalent themes (reducing uncertainty and offering comfort), and we provide critical analysis of the complexity of technology in these contexts. This work identifies specific opportunities for exploring anti-racist social tools.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to manage the workforce. Algorithmic management promises organizational efficiency, but often undermines worker well-being. How can we computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory approach for worker well-being models. We first define worker well-being models: Work preference models---preferences about work and working conditions, and managerial fairness models---beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple workers. We then propose elicitation methods to enable workers to build their own well-being models leveraging pairwise comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25 shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of empowerment. Our work provides a method and initial evidence for enabling participatory algorithmic management for worker well-being.},

abstract = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

However, little research has investigated how AI curriculum and tools can be designed to be more accessible to all teachers and learners. In this study, we take a Value-Sensitive Design approach to understanding the role of teacher values in the design of AI curriculum and tools, and identifying opportunities to integrate AI into core curriculum to leverage learners’ interests. We organized co-design workshops with 15 K-12 teachers, where teachers and researchers co-created lesson plans using AI tools and embedding AI concepts into various core subjects. We found that K-12 teachers need additional scaffolding in AI tools and curriculum to facilitate ethics and data discussions, and value supports for learner evaluation and engagement, peer-to-peer collaboration, and critical reflection. We present an exemplar lesson plan that shows entry points for teaching AI in non-computing subjects and reflect on co-designing with K-12 teachers in a remote setting.},

Healthcare authorities needs to effectively manage the healthcare supply chain processes not just during pandemics like COVID-19, but also in their everyday operations to guarantee best possible services. Product recalls, product supply shortage monitoring, expiry, and counterfeiting are some of the critical healthcare supply chain operations which must be ensured. Our suggested solution combines blockchain technology and distributed storage to increase transparency, improve stakeholder communication, and shorten product procurement timelines while eliminating crucial disparities and faults. We present a generic framework for the healthcare supply chain, equipped with comprehensive algorithms showing various stakeholder interactions. Our system uses the Ethereum network to link all parties, including the healthcare authority, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and healthcare provider. Remix IDE platform was used to develop and test the smart contract codes. As decentralized storage, we have used the combination of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric. We have also examined a variety of security issues, provided a cost analysis of the various transactions proposed in our solution while making comparison with similar blockchain-based solutions.},

abstract = {Online threats to children, in the form of cyberbullying, grooming, and sexting, have reached unprecedented and alarming levels. Support is still lacking despite endless efforts by child safety organisations and online safety educational programmes. This is mainly due to children feeling apprehensive in such situations, ashamed of revealing their distressing encounter to an adult or even for not having anyone to approach with their concerns. This paper investigates how children envision the potential support of a chatbot in such contexts. We captured design requirements for such a chatbot through a participatory design approach involving 110 schoolchildren in the UK. Using LEGO figures, they elaborated and performed stories featuring the interaction of a child under threat with a chatbot. The analysis of the dialogues in their performances and their reflections resulted in a set of expected tasks for the chatbot, a conversation flow, and novel socio-technical requirements addressing potential users’ main concerns and expectations.},

However, as researchers and technology companies rush to develop AI applications that aid the health of marginalized communities, it is critical to consider the needs and perceptions of the community health workers (CHWs) who will have to integrate these AI applications into the essential healthcare services they provide to rural communities. We describe a qualitative study examining CHWs’ perceptions of an AI application for automated disease diagnosis. Drawing on data from 21 interviews with CHWs in rural India, we characterize (1) CHWs’ knowledge, perceptions, and understandings of AI; and (2) the benefits and challenges that CHWs anticipate as AI applications are integrated into their workflows, including their opinions on automation of their work, possible misdiagnosis and errors, data access and surveillance issues, security and privacy challenges, and questions concerning trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for HCI and AI research in low-resource environments.},

A structured understanding of how designers work with AI is needed to improve the design process and educate future designers. To that end, we conducted interviews with designers who participated in projects which used AI. While past work focused on AI systems created by experienced designers, we focus on the perspectives of a diverse sample of interaction designers. Our results show that the design process of an interactive system is affected when AI is integrated and that design teams adapt their processes to accommodate AI. Based on our data, we contribute four approaches adopted by interaction designers working with AI: a priori, post-hoc, model-centric, and competence-centric. Our work contributes a pragmatic account of how design processes for AI systems are enacted.},

abstract = {Data-driven and algorithmic systems have been introduced to support Public Employment Services (PES) throughout the world. Their deployment has sparked public controversy and, as a consequence, some of these systems have been removed from use or their role was reduced. Yet the implementation of similar systems continues. In this paper, we use a participatory approach to determine a course forward for research and development in this area. We draw attention to the needs and expectations of people directly affected by these systems, i.e., jobseekers. Our investigation comprises two workshops: the first a fact-finding workshop with academics, system developers, the public sector, and civil-society organizations, the second a co-design workshop with 13 unemployed migrants to Germany. Based on the discussion in the fact-finding workshop we identified challenges of existing PES (algorithmic) systems. From the co-design workshop we identified our participants’ needs and desires when contacting PES: the need for human contact, the expectation to receive genuine orientation, and the desire to be seen as a whole human being. We map these expectations to three design considerations for data-driven and algorithmic systems for PES: the importance of interpersonal interaction, jobseeker assessment as direction, and the challenge of mitigating misrepresentation. Finally, we argue that the limitations and risks of current systems cannot be addressed through minor adjustments but require a more fundamental change to the role of PES.},

The co-design process followed an artistic approach and consisted of three cycles of labs, workshops and events during the span of one year to support professionals with non-technical background in the ideation and conceptualization of possible futures. The artistic approach consisted of different exploration perspectives of technology through the use of embodiment, artifacts and creation of speculative fictions. The research team that facilitated the labs was interdisciplinary and the participants were assembled from different partner organizations from industry and public sector. We share the learnings from this study attending to three different perspectives: our learnings from the facilitation of the artistic approach, our learnings from the future of work ideas and concepts developed by participants, and discussion of what these learnings can mean to design practitioners and the research community. Results indicate that embodiment and speculative fiction can create engagement among professionals that lack technical expertise and support them in collaborative exploration of alternative futures of work with novel and abstract technologies such as AI.},

Ubiquitous platforms (e.g., smart home systems, including smart meters and conversational agents) are increasingly commonplace and increasingly apply complex ML methods. Understanding how non-ML experts comprehend these platforms is important in supporting participants in making an informed choice about if and how they adopt these platforms. To aid this decision-making process, we created a companion guide for a home health platform through an iterative user-centred-design process, seeking additional input from platform experts at all stages of the process to ensure the accuracy of explanations. This user-centred and expert informed design process highlights the need to present the platform's entire ecosystem at an appropriate level for those with differing backgrounds to understand, in order to support informed consent and decision making.},

Previous research has addressed this issue by proposing standardized checklists to document datasets. This paper expands that field of inquiry by proposing a shift of perspective: from documenting datasets towards documenting data production. We draw on participatory design and collaborate with data workers at two companies located in Bulgaria and Argentina, where the collection and annotation of data for machine learning are outsourced. Our investigation comprises 2.5 years of research, including 33 semi-structured interviews, five co-design workshops, the development of prototypes, and several feedback instances with participants. We identify key challenges and requirements related to the integration of documentation practices in real-world data production scenarios. Our findings comprise important design considerations and highlight the value of designing data documentation based on the needs of data workers. We argue that a view of documentation as a boundary object, i.e., an object that can be used differently across organizations and teams but holds enough immutable content to maintain integrity, can be useful when designing documentation to retrieve heterogeneous, often distributed, contexts of data production.},

Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector.},

abstract = {Remote collaboration systems have become increasingly important in today’s society, especially during times when physical distancing is advised. Industry, research, and individuals face the challenging task of collaborating and networking over long distances. While video and teleconferencing are already widespread, collaboration systems in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality are still a niche technology. We provide an overview of recent developments of synchronous remote collaboration systems and create a taxonomy by dividing them into three main components that form such systems: Environment, Avatars, and Interaction. A thorough overview of existing systems is given, categorising their main contributions to help researchers working in different fields by providing concise information about specific topics such as avatars, virtual environment, visualisation styles, and interaction. The focus of this work is clearly on synchronised collaboration from a distance. A total of 87 unique systems for remote collaboration are discussed, including more than 100 publications and 25 commercial systems.},

abstract = {A growing number of oversight boards and regulatory bodies seek to monitor and govern algorithms that make decisions about people’s lives. Prior work has explored how people believe algorithmic decisions should be made, but there is little understanding of how individual factors like sociodemographics or direct experience with a decision-making scenario may affect their ethical views. We take a step toward filling this gap by exploring how people’s perceptions of one aspect of procedural algorithmic fairness (the fairness of using particular features in an algorithmic decision) relate to their (i) demographics (age, education, gender, race, political views) and (ii) personal experiences with the algorithmic decision-making scenario. We find that political views and personal experience with the algorithmic decision context significantly influence perceptions about the fairness of using different features for bail decision-making. Drawing on our results, we discuss the implications for stakeholder engagement and algorithmic oversight including the need to consider multiple dimensions of diversity in composing oversight and regulatory bodies.},

abstract = {The paper presents the system based on the layered hierarchical graphs for game plot description implemented in Godot Engine using the JSON format. The aim of the presented research is to create a tool that both supports the decision-making process and helps multiple writers to collaborate in creating a game world. Constructing a layered hierarchical graph provides information about game plot description, while the proposed graph generation system based on JSON data format allows designers and story writers to create game worlds. A key feature of the graph generation system is that it describes game worlds using a sequence of generation rules which represent the player's actions. On the one hand, the proposed approach helps the story writers to control the impact of the created story elements on the game world. On the other hand, it allows world designers to use procedural generation of narration chains, analyze and test the designed game plots. An additional goal of this approach strongly focused on using the JSON data format to describe actions that can be taken in world states is the impact of JSON data structures on the application of graph rules, which may be important in the problems of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {From initial case-reporting at the crime scene to finishing legal procedures, survivors of sexual assault navigate numerous human and technological resources provided by various organizations. During the help-seeking process, survivors unavoidably interact with multiple professional stakeholders (e.g., legal authorities) and technologies (e.g., checking their case status on a court website). In the long and complex process, survivors experience interactional breakdowns with technology, and/or humans, but few studies have explored what types of breakdowns systematically occur and how to resolve them. Thus, for this study, we conducted in-depth interviews with survivors and professionals who reside in South Korea to identify what and how breakdowns occur. Moreover, participatory design sessions were conducted with sexual assault survivors and professionals to create designs that could resolve the breakdowns. Consequently, we discovered a total of eleven breakdowns and produced solutions centered on the stakeholders (i.e., survivor and professionals). Specifically, our participants wanted an integrated system that proactively informs survivors of the holistic procedures for help-seeking and legal action, manages their case, and even interacts with legal authorities on the survivor's behalf. Based on the findings, we provide an agenda of essential designs and features that could mitigate interactional breakdowns. Additionally, we call for the HCI community to approach and solve sexual violence problems through a broad, macroscopic perspective instead of focusing on one specific technology or (social or organizational) system.},

abstract = {Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease affecting 264 million people worldwide. While many antidepressant medications are available, few clinical guidelines support choosing among them. Decision support tools (DSTs) embodying machine learning models may help improve the treatment selection process, but often fail in clinical practice due to poor system integration. We use an iterative, co-design process to investigate clinicians’ perceptions of using DSTs in antidepressant treatment decisions. We identify ways in which DSTs need to engage with the healthcare sociotechnical system, including clinical processes, patient preferences, resource constraints, and domain knowledge. Our results suggest that clinical DSTs should be designed as multi-user systems that support patient-provider collaboration and offer on-demand explanations that address discrepancies between predictions and current standards of care. Through this work, we demonstrate how current trends in explainable AI may be inappropriate for clinical environments and consider paths towards designing these tools for real-world medical systems.},

abstract = {One of the most difficult aspects of the present COVID19 pandemic is early identification and diagnosis of COVID19, as well as exact segregation of non-COVID19 individuals at low cost and the sickness is in its early stages. Despite their widespread use in diagnostic centres, diagnostic approaches based solely on radiological imaging have flaws given the disease's novelty. As a result, to evaluate radiological pictures, healthcare practitioners and computer scientists frequently use machine learning and deep learning models. Based on a search strategy, from November 2019 to July 2020, researchers scanned the three different databases of Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for this study. Machine learning and deep learning are well-established artificial intelligence domains for data mining, analysis, and pattern recognition. Deep learning in which data is passed through many layers and automatically learning the composition of each layer from large dataset and it enables a new way that evaluates the complete image without human guidance to discern which insights are valuable, with applications ranging from object detection to medical image. Deep learning with CNN may have a significant effect on the automatic recognition and extraction of crucial features from X-ray and CT Scan images related to Covid19 analysis. According to the results, models based on deep learning possess amazing abilities to offer a precise and systematic system for detecting and diagnosing COVID19. In the field of COVID19 radiological imaging, deep learning software decreases false positive and false negative errors in the identification and diagnosis of the disease. It is providing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide patients with quick, inexpensive, and safe diagnostic services while also reducing the epidemic's impact on nursing and medical staff.},

Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design AI learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about AI, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity AI literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for AI-related exhibits and directions for future research.},

This paper describes a unique month-long workshop that convened interdisciplinary experts to collaborate on projects related to flood data. In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions. First, we position interdisciplinarity as a critical practice and offer a detailed example of how we staged this process. We then discuss the benefits to interdisciplinarity of expanding the range of temporal logics normally deployed in design workshops. Finally, we reflect on approaches to evaluating the event's contributions toward sustained critique and reform of expert practice.},

In Human-Centered AI discourses, and more broadly in Human-Computer Interaction research, initiatives have been proposed to engage experts from various domains of social science in determining how AI should reach our societies, predominantly through informing the adoption policies. Our contribution, however, seeks a more essential role for social sciences, namely to introduce discursive standpoints around what we need AI to be. With a focus on the domain of urbanism, the specific goal has been to elicit – from interviews with 16 urban experts – the imaginaries of how AI can and should impact future cities. Drawing on the social science literature, we present how the notion of “imaginary” has essentially framed this research and how it could reveal an alternative vision of non-human intelligent actors in future cities.},

In this paper, we develop a generalizable chatbot architecture (CASS) to provide social support for community members in an online health community. The CASS architecture is based on advanced neural network algorithms, thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety of responses to them. CASS is also generalizable as it can be easily migrate to other online communities. With a follow-up field experiment, CASS is proven useful in supporting individual members who seek emotional support. Our work also contributes to fill the research gap on how a chatbot may influence the whole community's engagement.},

However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1)&nbsp;divergent perspectives on fairness, 2)&nbsp;the accuracy of AI, 3)&nbsp;the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4)&nbsp;the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5)&nbsp;the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity.

abstract = {Current cloud deletion mechanisms fall short in meeting users’ various deletion needs. They assume all data is deleted the same way—data is temporally removed (or hidden) from users’ cloud accounts before being completely deleted. This assumption neglects users’ desire to have data completely deleted instantly or their preference to have it recoverable for a more extended period. To date, these preferences have not been explored. To address this gap, we conducted a participatory study with four groups of active cloud users (five subjects per group). We examined their deletion preferences and the information they require to aid deletion. In particular, we explored how users want to delete cloud data and identify what information about cloud deletion they consider essential, the time it should be made available to them, and the communication channel that should be used. We show that cloud deletion preferences are complex and multi-dimensional, varying between subjects and groups. Information about deletion should be within reach when needed, for instance, be part of deletion controls. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of our study in improving the current deletion mechanism to accommodate these preferences.},

abstract = {Remote strength assessment is critical for providing accessible rehabilitation, especially in the absence of in-person meetings due to the pandemic. In this paper, we introduce ”Virtepex”, an immersive exergame for remote strength assessment developed through participatory design principles. We bring out the design process starting with a needs assessment to highlight the challenges for physicians in telehealth, followed by the expert guidelines for iterative system refinement. Virtepex addresses the challenges for remote strength assessment through a marker-less and an easy-to-setup strength estimation pipeline. It utilizes an RGB-D camera for motion tracking and an inverse dynamics module for force estimation. The force estimates are used for VR object interaction and can be assessed by a physician synchronously or asynchronously for an objective evaluation. Validation by external experts shows that Virtepex produces reliable force estimates for upper body joints, indicating the potential of marker-less force estimation for future remote assessment designs.},

abstract = {The promise AI’s proponents have made for decades is one in which our needs are predicted, anticipated, and met - often before we even realize it. Instead, algorithmic systems, particularly AIs trained on large datasets and deployed to massive scales, seem to keep making the wrong decisions, causing harm and rewarding absurd outcomes. Attempts to make sense of why AIs make wrong calls in the moment explain the instances of errors, but how the environment surrounding these systems precipitate those instances remains murky. This paper draws from anthropological work on bureaucracies, states, and power, translating these ideas into a theory describing the structural tendency for powerful algorithmic systems to cause tremendous harm. I show how administrative models and projections of the world create marginalization, just as algorithmic models cause representational and allocative harm. This paper concludes with a recommendation to avoid the absurdity algorithmic systems produce by denying them power.},

By engaging 20 ML practitioners in a simulated scenario in which they utilize fairness toolkits to make critical decisions, this work aims to utilize practitioner feedback to inform recommendations for the design and creation of fair ML toolkits. Through the use of survey and interview data, our results indicate that though fair ML toolkits are incredibly impactful on users’ decision-making, there is much to be desired in the design and demonstration of fairness results. To support the future development and evaluation of toolkits, this work offers a rubric that can be used to identify critical components of Fair ML toolkits.},

However, they can be ineffective when they are designed without a careful consideration of the cultural context of the users, especially for marginalized groups. Chatbots designed without cultural understanding may result in loss of trust and disengagement of the user. In this paper, through an interview study, we attempt to understand how chatbots can be better designed for Black American communities within the context of COVID-19. Along with the interviews, we performed design activities with 18 Black Americans that allowed them to envision and design their own chatbot to address their needs and challenges during the pandemic. We report our findings on our participants’ needs for chatbots’ roles and features, and their challenges in using chatbots. We then present design implications for future chatbot design for the Black American population.},

abstract = {Smart home systems contain plenty of features that enhance wellbeing in everyday life through artificial intelligence (AI). However, many users feel insecure because they do not understand the AI’s functionality and do not feel they are in control of it. Combining technical, psychological and philosophical views on AI, we rethink smart homes as interactive systems where users can partake in an intelligent agent’s learning. Parallel to the goals of explainable AI (XAI), we explored the possibility of user involvement in supervised learning of the smart home to have a first approach to improve acceptance, support subjective understanding and increase perceived control. In this work, we conducted two studies: In an online pre-study, we asked participants about their attitude towards teaching AI via a questionnaire. In the main study, we performed a Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with human participants, where participants spent time in a prototypical smart home and taught activity recognition to the intelligent agent through supervised learning based on the user’s behaviour. We found that involvement in the AI’s learning phase enhanced the users’ feeling of control, perceived understanding and perceived usefulness of AI in general. The participants reported positive attitudes towards training a smart home AI and found the process understandable and controllable. We suggest that involving the user in the learning phase could lead to better personalisation and increased understanding and control by users of intelligent agents for smart home automation.},

This research focuses on how interdisciplinary teams that include UX practitioners design real-world enterprise ML systems outside of big technology companies. We conducted a survey with product managers, and interviews with interdisciplinary teams and individual UX practitioners. The findings show that nontechnical UX practitioners are highly capable in designing AI/ML systems. In addition to applying UX and interaction design expertise to make decisions regarding functionality, they employ skills that aid collaboration across interdisciplinary teams. However, our findings suggest existing HCI design techniques such as prototyping and simulating complexity of enterprise ML systems are insufficient. We propose adaptations to design practices and conclude that some existing research should be reconsidered.},

The recent surge in scientific and commercial interest in conversational agents and their potential to improve diagnosis and treatment seems a potentially fruitful area in this respect, particularly for young adults who widely use such systems in other contexts. Yet, there is little research that considers the acceptability of conversational agents in mental health. This study, therefore, presents three research activities that explore whether conversational agents and, in particular, chatbots can be an acceptable solution in mental healthcare for young adults. First, a survey of young adults (in a university setting) provides an understanding of the landscape of mental health in this age group and of their views around mental health technology, including chatbots. Second, a literature review synthesises current evidence relating to the acceptability of mental health conversational agents and points to future research priorities. Third, interviews with counsellors who work with young adults, supported by a chatbot prototype and user-centred design techniques, reveal the perceived benefits and potential roles of mental health chatbots from the perspective of mental health professionals, while suggesting preconditions for the acceptability of the technology. Taken together, these research activities: provide evidence that chatbots are an acceptable solution to offering mental health support for young adults; identify specific challenges relating to both the technology and environment; and argue for the application of user-centred approaches during development of mental health chatbots and more systematic and rigorous evaluations of the resulting solutions.},

abstract = {A key challenge in human-robot interaction (HRI) design is to create and sustain engaging social interactions. This paper argues that improvisational techniques from the performing arts can address this challenge. Contrary to the ways in which improvisation is generally used in social robotics, we propose an understanding of improvisational techniques as based on rules that shape motion choices. We claim that such an approach, represented in what we name the "external" and "emergent" perspectives on improvisation, could benefit the way in which robot movement and behaviour is designed and deployed, increasing playful engagement and responsiveness. As an example of this type of improvisation, we discuss how American dancer and choreographer William Forsythe's Improvisation Technologies could be used in an HRI context. We also report on a preliminary experimentation using a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory prototyping system and a participatory design method with professional dancers geared towards the exploration of interactive movement possibilities with a Pepper robot. Finally, we report on how this workshop offered valuable information about the applicability of these tools, as well as reflections on how it could help increase the level of engagement in the interaction.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

abstract = {Cyberbullying is a growing problem across social media platforms, inflicting short and long-lasting effects on victims. To mitigate this problem, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around the roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations of humans. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection. We analyzed 56 papers based on a three-prong human-centeredness algorithm design framework - spanning theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. We found that the past literature fell short of incorporating human-centeredness across multiple aspects, ranging from defining cyberbullying, establishing the ground truth in data annotation, evaluating the performance of the detection models, to speculating the usage and users of the models, including potential harms and negative consequences. Given the sensitivities of the cyberbullying experience and the deep ramifications cyberbullying incidents bear on the involved actors, we discuss takeaways on how incorporating human-centeredness in future research can aid with developing detection systems that are more practical, useful, and tuned to the diverse needs and contexts of the stakeholders.},

In particular, low-vision readers using magnification encounter additional barriers to quickly skimming and visually locating information. In this work, we explored the design of interfaces to enable readers to: 1) navigate papers more easily, and 2) input the required navigation hooks that AI cannot currently automate. To explore this design space, we ran two exploratory studies. The first focused on current practices of low-vision paper readers, the challenges they encounter, and the interfaces they desire. During this study, low-vision participants were interviewed, and tried out four new paper navigation prototypes. Results from this study grounded the design of our end-to-end system prototype Ocean, which provides an accessible front-end for low-vision readers, and enables all readers to contribute to the backend by leaving traces of their reading paths for others to leverage. Our second study used this exploratory interface in a field study with groups of low-vision and sighted readers to probe the user experience of reading and creating traces. Our findings suggest that it may be possible for readers of all abilities to organically leave traces in papers, and that these traces can be used to facilitate navigation tasks, in particular for low-vision readers. Based on our findings, we present design considerations for creating future paper-reading tools that improve access, and organically source the required data from readers.},

abstract = {The automatic detection of conflictual languages (harmful, aggressive, abusive, and offensive languages) is essential to provide a healthy conversation environment on the Web. To design and develop detection systems that are capable of achieving satisfactory performance, a thorough understanding of the nature and properties of the targeted type of conflictual language is of great importance. The scientific communities investigating human psychology and social behavior have studied these languages in details, but their insights have only partially reached the computer science community.In this survey, we aim both at systematically characterizing the conceptual properties of online conflictual languages, and at investigating the extent to which they are reflected in state-of-the-art automatic detection systems. Through an analysis of psychology literature, we provide a reconciled taxonomy that denotes the ensemble of conflictual languages typically studied in computer science. We then characterize the conceptual mismatches that can be observed in the main semantic and contextual properties of these languages and their treatment in computer science works; and systematically uncover resulting technical biases in the design of machine learning classification models and the dataset created for their training. Finally, we discuss diverse research opportunities for the computer science community and reflect on broader technical and structural issues.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of home and social robot products, it is essential for the general population to feel comfortable in using and understanding these robots in their homes. The goal of this research is to understand the general population's definition of "robot state." We conducted 11 participatory design groups (PDGs) (n=30), in which participants completed two exercises: (1) Memory based: they recalled their past robots to come up with a working "robot state" definition through a series of exercises, and (2) Example-based: they saw short videos of 3 different home robots. Each PDG session yielded a set of "robot states" they felt were important to communicate to a user and a "robot state" definition, which were tested with the same set of participants via an online survey. We found that On/off/booting was significantly rated as more important than all other robot states. Interestingly, task-related stimuli did not result in task-related states being rated being more important to communicate to the user. We believe establishing fundamental knowledge of "robot states" will increase acceptability of home robots by the users and aid robot designers by providing information on states that are essential to be communicated.},

abstract = {Investigative data journalists work with a variety of data sources to tell a story. Though prior work has indicated that there is a close relationship between journalists' data work practices and that of data scientists. However, these relationships and data work practices are not empirically examined, and understanding them is crucial to inform the design of tools that are used by different groups of people including data scientists and data journalists. Thus, to bridge this gap, we studied investigative reporters' data work practices with one non-profit investigative newsroom. Our study design includes two activities: 1) semi-structured interviews with journalists, and 2) a sketching activity allowing journalists to depict examples of their work practices. By analyzing these data and synthesizing them across related prior work, we propose the major phases in the data-driven investigative journalism story idea generation process. Our study findings show that the journalists employ a collection of multiple, iterative, cyclic processes to identify journalistically "interesting'' story ideas. These processes both significantly resemble and show subtle nuanced differences with data science work practices identified in prior research. We further verified our proposal through a member check with key informants. This work offers three primary contributions. First, it provides a close glimpse into the main phases of investigative journalists' data-driven story idea generation technique. Second, it complements prior work studying formal data science practices by examining data-driven investigative journalists, whose primary expertise lies outside computing. Third, it identifies particular points in the data exploration processes that would benefit from design interventions and suggests future research directions.},

However, we still lack an understanding of how to develop machine learning systems with fairness criteria that reflect relevant stakeholders’ nuanced viewpoints in real-world contexts. To address this gap, we propose a framework for eliciting stakeholders’ subjective fairness notions. Combining a user interface that allows stakeholders to examine the data and the algorithm’s predictions with an interview protocol to probe stakeholders’ thoughts while they are interacting with the interface, we can identify stakeholders’ fairness beliefs and principles. We conduct a user study to evaluate our framework in the setting of a child maltreatment predictive system. Our evaluations show that the framework allows stakeholders to comprehensively convey their fairness viewpoints. We also discuss how our results can inform the design of predictive systems.},

This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring” through co-designed speculative design fictions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fictions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},

abstract = {A number of initiatives invite members of the public to perform online classification tasks such as identifying objects in images. These tasks are crucial to numerous large-scale Citizen Science projects in different disciplines, with volunteers using their knowledge and online support tools to, for example, identify species of wildlife or classify galaxies by their shapes. However, for complex classification tasks, such as this case study on identifying species of bumblebee, reaching an agreement between volunteers - or even between experts~-~may require consensus-building processes. Collaboration and teamwork approaches to problem solving and decision-making have been widely documented to improve both task performance and user learning in the real world. Most of these processes and projects are mediated online through feedback delivered in an asynchronous manner, and this article thus addresses a central research question: How do participants involved in species identification tasks respond to different forms of feedback provided in online collaboration, designed to support peer-learning and improve task performance? We tested four different approaches to feedback within a collaboration task, where participants reviewed their previously annotated data based on information curated from their peers on a long running online citizen science initiative. The selected interfaces have a strong foundation in social science and psychology literature and can be applied to citizen science practices as well as other online communities. Results showed that while all four approaches increased accuracy, there were differences based on the types of consensus that existed before collaboration. Such differences highlight the usefulness of different forms of feedback during collaboration for increasing data accuracy of identification and furthering users' expertise on identification tasks. We found that anonymised and goal-directed free text comments posted on social learning interfaces were most effective in improving data accuracy as well as creating opportunities for peer-learning, particularly where the species identification task was more difficult. This study has significant implications for extending the practice of citizen science across formal and informal learning environments and reaching out to a variety of users.},

It bridges epistemic divides in order to offer an interdisciplinary understanding of the possibilities and limits of hegemonic computational approaches to ML fairness for producing just outcomes for society’s most marginalized. The article is organized according to nine major themes of critique wherein these different fields intersect: 1) how "fairness" in AI fairness research gets defined; 2) how problems for AI systems to address get formulated; 3) the impacts of abstraction on how AI tools function and its propensity to lead to technological solutionism; 4) how racial classification operates within AI fairness research; 5) the use of AI fairness measures to avoid regulation and engage in ethics washing; 6) an absence of participatory design and democratic deliberation in AI fairness considerations; 7) data collection practices that entrench “bias,” are non-consensual, and lack transparency; 8) the predatory inclusion of marginalized groups into AI systems; and 9) a lack of engagement with AI’s long-term social and ethical outcomes. Drawing from these critiques, the article concludes by imagining future ML fairness research directions that actively disrupt entrenched power dynamics and structural injustices in society.},

A user-centered approach was chosen, including a context analysis, qualitative interviews, and a shortened design sprint. From the insights gained, design implications as well as two hands-on application scenarios were derived. Based on this, a high-fidelity prototype was developed with modern web technologies. Afterwards, a summative evaluation was conducted in an interactive and cohesive online survey where participants could interact directly with the embedded prototype. The results show that the majority of participants expect such a system to have a positive impact on decision-making during budget preparations. Furthermore, most of the defined design requirements were fulfilled and the usability as well as the visual aesthetics of the prototype, were evaluated in a positive manner. The design implications provide a profound basis for further research and design iterations.},

If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA gameFor Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been sanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players. This research shows that observing in-game behavior can support the work of community managers in moderating and possibly containing the burden of toxic behavior.},

abstract = {The rise of automated text processing systems has led to the development of tools designed for a wide variety of application domains. These technologies are often developed to support non-technical users such as domain experts and are often developed in isolation of the tools primary user. While such developments are exciting, less attention has been paid to domain experts’ expectations about the values embedded in these automated systems. As a step toward addressing that gap, we examined values expectations of journalists and legal experts. Both these domains involve extensive text processing and place high importance on values in professional practice. We engaged participants from two non-profit organizations in two separate co-speculation design workshops centered around several speculative automated text processing systems. This study makes three interrelated contributions. First, we provide a detailed investigation of domain experts’ values expectations around future NLP systems. Second, the speculative design fiction concepts, which we specifically crafted for these investigative journalists and legal experts, illuminated a series of tensions around the technical implementation details of automation. Third, our findings highlight the utility of design fiction in eliciting not-to-design implications, not only about automated NLP but also about technology more broadly. Overall, our study findings provide groundwork for the inclusion of domain experts values whose expertise lies outside of the field of computing into the design of automated NLP systems.},

We developed NBSearch through an iterative participatory design process with two experts from a large software company. We evaluated the models with a series of experiments and the whole system with a controlled user study.

abstract = {Word embeddings are numeric representations of meaning derived from word co-occurrence statistics in corpora of human-produced texts. The statistical regularities in language corpora encode well-known social biases into word embeddings (e.g., the word vector for family is closer to the vector women than to men). Although efforts have been made to mitigate bias in word embeddings, with the hope of improving fairness in downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, these efforts will remain limited until we more deeply understand the multiple (and often subtle) ways that social biases can be reflected in word embeddings. Here, we focus on gender to provide a comprehensive analysis of group-based biases in widely-used static English word embeddings trained on internet corpora (GloVe 2014, fastText 2017). While some previous research has helped uncover biases in specific semantic associations between a group and a target domain (e.g., women - family), using the Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence of gender biases that also show differences in: (1) frequencies of words associated with men versus women; (b) part-of-speech tags in gender-associated words; (c) semantic categories in gender-associated words; and (d) valence, arousal, and dominance in gender-associated words. We leave the analysis of non-binary gender to future work due to the challenges in accurate group representation caused by limitations inherent in data.First, in terms of word frequency: we find that, of the 1,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary, 77% are more associated with men than women, providing direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of the English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top male-associated words are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the top female-associated words are typically adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving, emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate parts-of-speech. Third, for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000 words associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and domains of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast, the top female-associated concepts are less focused on roles, including, instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content, as well as appearance and kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and dominance from a ~20,000 word lexicon, we find that male-associated words are higher on arousal and dominance, while female-associated words are higher on valence. Ultimately, these findings move the study of gender bias in word embeddings beyond the basic investigation of semantic relationships to also study gender differences in multiple manifestations in text. Given the central role of word embeddings in NLP applications, it is essential to more comprehensively document where biases exist and may remain hidden, allowing them to persist without our awareness throughout large text corpora.},

abstract = {We present the design process of the robot YOLO aimed at stimulating creativity in children. This robot was developed under a human-centered design approach with participatory design practices during two years and involving 142 children as active contributors at all design stages. The main contribution of this work is the development of methods and tools for child-centered robot design. We adapted existing participatory design practices used with adults to fit children's development stages. We followed the Double-Diamond Design Process Model and rested the design process of the robot on the following principles: low floor and wide walls, creativity provocations, open-ended playfulness, and disappointment avoidance through abstraction. The final product is a social robot designed for and with children. Our results show that YOLO increases their creativity during play, demonstrating a successful robot design project. We identified several guidelines that made the design process successful: the use of toys as tools, playgrounds as spaces, the emphasis of playfulness for child expression, and child policies as allies for design studies. The design process described empowers children's in the design of robots.},

abstract = {Hybrid Simulation (HS) is the application of two or more simulation techniques (e.g., ABS, DES, SD) in a single M&amp;S study. Distinct from HS, Hybrid Modelling (HM) is defined as the combined application of simulation approaches (including HS) with methods and techniques from the broader OR/MS literature and also across disciplines. In this paper, we expand on the unified conceptual representation and classification of hybrid M&amp;S, which includes both HS (Model Types A-C), hybrid OR/MS models (D, D.1) and cross-disciplinary hybrid models (Type E), and assess their innovation potential. We argue that model types associated with HM (D, D.1, E), with its focus on OR/MS and cross-disciplinary research, are particularly well-placed in driving innovation in the theory and practice of M&amp;S. Application of these innovative HM methodologies will lead to innovation in the application space as new approaches in stakeholder engagement, conceptual modelling, system representation, V&amp;V, experimentation, etc. are identified.},

abstract = {Major humanitarian organizations face the crucial challenge of estimating land damage from conflict in developing countries. A lack of on the ground data collection motivates the use of satellite imagery to meet this challenge. However, existing analysis methods involving satellite imagery are time-consuming, require special expertise, or lack automation. To mitigate these obstacles, SatDash was designed using Sentinel-2 images and ACLED data to provide a classification of areas that have undergone land damage due to conflict in northwestern Nigeria and Mali. SatDash was constructed using free and publicly available images and is accompanied by a user-friendly dashboard that allows domain experts to train their own data and export it for future use. The dashboard was created for a humanitarian organization, referred to as the DAAO, Damage Assessment and Aid Organization, and the design process adhered to four primary recommendations for a successful AI for Social Good (AI4SG) partnership that are further detailed in this paper. Within this paper, I draw attention to the context of CHI4Good research, detailing how the deployment phases of such systems often have their own set of potential barriers, along with describing ethical challenges that arise with this type of research. This paper focuses primarily on the design process and responses to both the constraints mentioned in literature and those presented by the DAAO. I acknowledge that AI applications, especially in development contexts, require close attention and context-specific awareness, and this is reflected through the conscious decision to include domain experts and ensure that the tool is only used for its intended purpose. When designing SatDash, the primary aim was to think critically about the involvement of local context and spur the conversation about inclusive design of similar systems in a large organization such as the DAAO. This research affirms that satellite imagery data can be used to assist humanitarian aid organizations with land change detection and demonstrates how human-in-the-loop systems can aid these organizations with identification of communities negatively impacted by hunger and recurring conflict.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems operate in increasingly diverse areas, from healthcare to facial recognition, the stock market, autonomous vehicles, and so on. While the underlying digital infrastructure of AI systems is developing rapidly, each area of implementation is subject to different degrees and processes of legitimization. By combining elements from institutional theory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual framework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction of novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which algorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing institutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which organizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure and governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still are unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be contested. The institutional infrastructure surrounding AI-induced fields is generally little elaborated, which could be an obstacle to the broader institutionalization of AI-systems going forward.},

Robots may enable smooth non face-to-face interactions between medical staff and patients by providing cognitive and physical support to the medical staff. In this paper, we identified the medical staff's pain points and needs about the robots which would help them. In addition, researchers and medical staff together participated in generating the design concept of a robot needed in times of COVID-19 as design participants. We conducted qualitative interviews about robots with nurses working in a negative pressure isolation room (NPIR) where patients with COVID-19 are isolated while treatment. As a result, the needs for supporting increased workload including inventory monitoring, waste management, meal delivery, and medicine delivery as well as supporting communication in emergency including communication in patient's emergency and communication in medical staff's emergency were discovered. Based on the findings from the interview, we proposed a robot design concept that can satisfy medical staff's need in NPIR.},

abstract = {English: With the increasing attention non-binary people receive in Western societies, strategies of gender-fair language have started to move away from binary (only female/male) concepts of gender. Nevertheless, hardly any approaches to take these identities into account into machine translation models exist so far. A lack of understanding of the socio-technical implications of such technologies risks further reproducing linguistic mechanisms of oppression and mislabelling. In this paper, we describe the methods and results of a workshop on gender-fair language and language technologies, which was led and organised by ten researchers from TU Wien, St. P\"{o}lten UAS, FH Campus Wien and the University of Vienna and took place in Vienna in autumn 2021. A wide range of interest groups and their representatives were invited to ensure that the topic could be dealt with holistically. Accordingly, we aimed to include translators, machine translation experts and non-binary individuals (as “community experts”) on an equal footing. Our analysis shows that gender in machine translation requires a high degree of context sensitivity, that developers of such technologies need to position themselves cautiously in a process still under social negotiation, and that flexible approaches seem most adequate at present. We then illustrate steps that follow from our results for the field of gender-fair language technologies so that technological developments can adequately line up with social advancements. Deutsch: Mit zunehmender gesamtgesellschaftlicher Wahrnehmung nicht-bin\"{a}rer Personen haben sich in den letzten Jahren auch Konzepte von genderfairer Sprache von der bisher verwendeten Binarit\"{a}t (weiblich/m\"{a}nnlich) entfernt. Trotzdem gibt es bislang nur wenige Ans\"{a}tze dazu, diese Identit\"{a}ten in maschineller \"{U}bersetzung abzubilden. Ein fehlendes Verst\"{a}ndnis unterschiedlicher sozio-technischer Implikationen derartiger Technologien birgt in sich die Gefahr, fehlerhafte Ansprachen und Bezeichnungen sowie sprachliche Unterdr\"{u}ckungsmechanismen zu reproduzieren. In diesem Beitrag beschreiben wir die Methoden und Ergebnisse eines Workshops zu genderfairer Sprache in technologischen Zusammenh\"{a}ngen, der im Herbst 2021 in Wien stattgefunden hat. Zehn Forscher*innen der TU Wien, FH St. P\"{o}lten, FH Campus Wien und Universit\"{a}t Wien organisierten und leiteten den Workshop. Dabei wurden unterschiedlichste Interessensgruppen und deren Vertreter*innen breit gestreut eingeladen, um sicherzustellen, dass das Thema holistisch behandelt werden kann. Dementsprechend setzten wir uns zum Ziel, Machine-Translation-Entwickler*innen, \"{U}bersetzer*innen, und nicht-bin\"{a}re Privatpersonen (als “Lebens-welt-Expert*innen”) gleichberechtigt einzubinden. Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass Geschlecht in maschineller \"{U}bersetzung eine ma\ss{}geblich kontextsensible Herangehensweise erfordert, die Entwicklung von Sprachtechnologien sich vorsichtig in einem sich noch in Aushandlung befindlichen gesellschaftlichen Prozess positionieren muss, und flexible Ans\"{a}tze derzeit am ad\"{a}quatesten erscheinen. Wir zeigen auf, welche n\"{a}chsten Schritte im Bereich genderfairer Technologien notwendig sind, damit technische mit sozialen Entwicklungen mithalten k\"{o}nnen.},

Prior studies have explored how ML is affecting development team roles beyond data scientists, including user experience designers, program managers, developers and operations engineers. However, there has been little investigation of how team members in different roles on the team communicate about ML, in particular about the quality of models. We use the general term quality to look beyond technical issues of model evaluation, such as accuracy and overfitting, to any issue affecting whether a model is suitable for use, including ethical, engineering, operations, and legal considerations. What challenges do teams face in discussing the quality of ML models? What work practices mitigate those challenges? To address these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods study at a large software company, first interviewing15 employees in a variety of roles, then surveying 168 employees to broaden our understanding. We found several challenges, including a mismatch between user-focused and model-focused notions of performance, misunderstandings about the capabilities and limitations of evolving ML technology, and difficulties in understanding concerns beyond one's own role. We found several mitigation strategies, including the use of demos during discussions to keep the team customer-focused.},

abstract = {Voice assistants (VAs), typically promoted as omniscient conversational butlers, still remain below users’ expectations. Interaction designers seem to struggle bringing in user perspectives necessary to develop more meaningful VA applications beyond simple use cases such as playing music. One of the reasons might be the immateriality of cloud-based VA technology making it difficult to comprehend such complex and ever-evolving systems. In this paper, we investigate provotyping as a design tool for ‘materialising the immaterial’. In our case study, teams of multidisciplinary experts devised twelve provotypes to explore intangible VA technology. We present and discuss three generalisations in respect to the role of provotypes for the exploration of VAs. Our findings show provotypes can serve as the necessary props by which we can bring in missing perspectives around this technology and generate material which enables designers to speculate, debate, and sketch out ideas for meaningful futures of VA applications.},

abstract = {Increasing police accountability in the US has been an issue for decades, but citizen-initiated reform efforts have been less than effective at moving the needle on the issue. Our project aims to provide citizens and community organizers with a better understanding of the legal landscape of police accountability in Allegheny County, allowing them to more effectively advocate for reform. We do so by creating an open collaborative network that works to overcome the issues of data inaccessibility, data complexity, and the fragmentation of data across different municipalities. We engaged with community leaders, gathered contracts and other data on over 100 police departments in Allegheny County, and created a web platform to make this previously inaccessible information available to the public. In its creation, we also utilized visual representation to aid those engaging with the law to better understand and collaborate without being inhibited by complicated legal concepts.},

abstract = {Feet are the foundation of our bodies that not only perform locomotion but also participate in intent and emotion expression. Thus, foot gestures are an intuitive and natural form of expression for interpersonal interaction. Recent studies have mostly introduced smart shoes as personal gadgets, while foot gestures used in multi-person foot interactions in social scenarios remain largely unexplored. We present Shoes++, which includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-mounted sole and an input vocabulary of social foot-to-foot gestures to support foot-based interaction. The gesture vocabulary is derived and condensed by a set of gestures elicited from a participatory design session with 12 users. We implement a machine learning model in Shoes++ which can recognize two-person and three-person social foot-to-foot gestures with 94.3% and 96.6% accuracies (N=18). In addition, the sole is designed to easily attach to and detach from various daily shoes to support comfortable social foot interaction without taking off the shoes. Based on users' qualitative feedback, we also found that Shoes++ can support team collaboration and enhance emotion expression, thus making social interactions or interpersonal dynamics more engaging in an expanded design space.},

The study is motivated by gender disparities in harm through online dating, and the relative absence of dating app designs that prioritize women. Findings show that women are receptive to the notion of AI that augments their existing strategies for assessing risk of harm with meeting a particular user face-to-face. They outline various physical and non-physical harms that they attempt to reduce uncertainty about, and a range of data points as indicators of risk that could serve as the basis for a risk awareness AI model. Due to subjectivity in what is considered an indicator of risk, current findings suggest that risk awareness AI, if implemented, should allow women to train their own models.},

abstract = {Trauma is the physical, emotional, or psychological harm caused by deeply distressing experiences. Research with communities that may experience high rates of trauma has shown that digital technologies can create or exacerbate traumatic experiences. Via three vignettes, we discuss how considering the possible effects of trauma and traumatic stress reactions provides an explanatory lens with new insights into people’s technology experiences. Then, we present a framework—trauma-informed computing—in which we adapt and show how to apply six key principles of trauma-informed approaches to computing: safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, enablement, and intersectionality. Through specific examples, we describe how to apply trauma-informed computing in four areas of computing research and practice: user experience research &amp; design, security &amp; privacy, artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning, and organizational culture in tech companies. We conclude by discussing how adopting trauma-informed computing will lead to benefits for all users, not only those experiencing trauma.},

abstract = {Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable speech-based communication. However, AAC devices do not support nonverbal communication, which allows people to take turns, regulate conversation dynamics, and express intentions. Nonverbal communication requires motion, which is often challenging for AAC users to produce due to motor constraints. In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as ''sidekicks,'' might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers' goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing. We show how these parameters manifest in appearance and behavior and how they can guide future designs for augmented nonverbal communication.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly involved in decision making in high-stakes domains, including loan applications, employment screening, and assistive clinical decision making. Meanwhile, involving AI in these high-stake decisions has created ethical concerns on how to balance different trade-offs to respect human values. One approach for aligning AIs with human values is to elicit human ethical preferences and incorporate this information in the design of computer systems. In this work, we explore how human ethical preferences are impacted by the information shown to humans during elicitation. In particular, we aim to provide a contrast between verifiable information (e.g., patient demographics or blood test results) and predictive information (e.g., the probability of organ transplant success). Using kidney transplant allocation as a case study, we conduct a randomized experiment to elicit human ethical preferences on scarce resource allocation to understand how human ethical preferences are impacted by the verifiable and predictive information. We find that the presence of predictive information significantly changes how humans take into account other verifiable information in their ethical preferences. We also find that the source of the predictive information (e.g., whether the predictions are made by AI or human doctors) plays a key role in how humans incorporate the predictive information into their own ethical judgements.},

The procedure is conspicuously sped up by selectively placing part of the deep learning calculation on accelerator devices with a heterogeneous collaborative computation scheme. We also design a lightweight GCN optimization method, which directly transfers the correlation between the image detection areas in projection to reduce computational redundancy. Our other contributions include performance analyses of models with different weights for industrial reference in practical applications. It is the first GCN-based image-text retrieval system to perform a real-time end-to-end search to the best of our knowledge. Experiments show that the system can process 20 image-to-text retrievals per second with high accuracy.},

To understand users as humans, and thus, the humanity in being a user, we adopt Viktor Frankl’s understanding of users as meaning-seeking subjects. To make the concept of meaningfulness more graspable, we refer to what Frankl calls the three existentials of life: freedom, responsibility, and noos. We elaborate four dimensions, namely the existentials as an outcome, as their embeddedness in technology, their role in interaction, and their (non-)usage. This is followed by a discussion on the interwovenness of the three existentials as well as their potential impact on HCI research. By that, we aim to contribute to a profound understanding of meaning for HCI, from the epistemological to the methodological perspective, to enable meaning-centered design.},

Research in the field therefore highlights the need for transparency, scrutability, intelligibility, interpretability and explainability, among others. While all of these terms carry a vision of supporting users in understanding intelligent systems, the underlying notions and assumptions about users and their interaction with the system often remain unclear. We review the literature in HCI through the lens of implied user questions to synthesise a conceptual framework integrating user mindsets, user involvement, and knowledge outcomes to reveal, differentiate and classify current notions in prior work. This framework aims to resolve conceptual ambiguity in the field and enables researchers to clarify their assumptions and become aware of those made in prior work. We further discuss related aspects such as stakeholders and trust, and also provide material to apply our framework in practice (e.g., ideation/design sessions). We thus hope to advance and structure the dialogue on supporting users in understanding intelligent systems.},

abstract = {Algorithmic audits (or ‘AI audits’) are an increasingly popular mechanism for algorithmic accountability; however, they remain poorly defined. Without a clear understanding of audit practices, let alone widely used standards or regulatory guidance, claims that an AI product or system has been audited, whether by first-, second-, or third-party auditors, are difficult to verify and may potentially exacerbate, rather than mitigate, bias and harm. To address this knowledge gap, we provide the first comprehensive field scan of the AI audit ecosystem. We share a catalog of individuals (N=438) and organizations (N=189) who engage in algorithmic audits or whose work is directly relevant to algorithmic audits; conduct an anonymous survey of the group (N=152); and interview industry leaders (N=10). We identify emerging best practices as well as methods and tools that are becoming commonplace, and enumerate common barriers to leveraging algorithmic audits as effective accountability mechanisms. We outline policy recommendations to improve the quality and impact of these audits, and highlight proposals with wide support from algorithmic auditors as well as areas of debate. Our recommendations have implications for lawmakers, regulators, internal company policymakers, and standards-setting bodies, as well as for auditors. They are: 1) require the owners and operators of AI systems to engage in independent algorithmic audits against clearly defined standards; 2) notify individuals when they are subject to algorithmic decision-making systems; 3) mandate disclosure of key components of audit findings for peer review; 4) consider real-world harm in the audit process, including through standardized harm incident reporting and response mechanisms; 5) directly involve the stakeholders most likely to be harmed by AI systems in the algorithmic audit process; and 6) formalize evaluation and, potentially, accreditation of algorithmic auditors.},

abstract = {Because algorithm audits are conducted by technical experts, audits are necessarily limited to the hypotheses that experts think to test. End users hold the promise to expand this purview, as they inhabit spaces and witness algorithmic impacts that auditors do not. In pursuit of this goal, we propose end-user audits-system-scale audits led by non-technical users-and present an approach that scaffolds end users in hypothesis generation, evidence identification, and results communication. Today, performing a system-scale audit requires substantial user effort to label thousands of system outputs, so we introduce a collaborative filtering technique that leverages the algorithmic system's own disaggregated training data to project from a small number of end user labels onto the full test set. Our end-user auditing tool, IndieLabel, employs these predicted labels so that users can rapidly explore where their opinions diverge from the algorithmic system's outputs. By highlighting topic areas where the system is under-performing for the user and surfacing sets of likely error cases, the tool guides the user in authoring an audit report. In an evaluation of end-user audits on a popular comment toxicity model with 17 non-technical participants, participants both replicated issues that formal audits had previously identified and also raised previously underreported issues such as under-flagging on veiled forms of hate that perpetuate stigma and over-flagging of slurs that have been reclaimed by marginalized communities.},

abstract = {The use of AI and other algorithms in resource-constrained public sector settings of the developing world face unique technical and social challenges. The organizational and institutional realities of the public sector such as legacy data/IT systems, embedded work culture, bureaucratic norms and resource-constraints both explicitly and implicitly shape deliberation, design and deployment of public sector data science projects. Through the case of algorithmic rural road planning in a large-scale government program in India, our work demonstrates how algorithms can be positively utilized within the context of constrained capacities and choices. As practitioners deeply involved in the entire project life-cycle, our action-research provides an intimate and reflective account of how production of even seemingly “simple” algorithmic projects pose non-trivial complexities and challenges in the public sector. We situate the conversation around the humans-in-the-loop in our setting and show how public sector characteristics impact participatory design, choice of interfaces, data inequities and algorithm design. Further, we show how the preparation and production of technology by constrained capacities can be counter-productive and detrimental even before the technology is put to use. This further expands the scope of the debate concerning the use of public sector algorithms. Understanding the nuances, practices and constraints in production of data science in the public sector will not only allow more responsible production of data sciences, but also help formulate realistic strategies to mitigate the risks involved in the use of algorithms in high-stakes public policy situations.},

abstract = {While AI systems become more pervasive, their social impact is increasingly hard to measure. To help mitigate possible risks and guide practitioners into a more responsible design, diverse organizations have released AI ethics frameworks. However, it remains unclear how ethical issues are dealt with in the everyday practices of AI developers. To this end, we have carried an exploratory empirical study interviewing AI developers working for Swedish public organizations to understand how ethics are enacted in practice. Our analysis found that several AI ethics issues are not consistently tackled, and AI systems are not fully recognized as part of a broader sociotechnical system.},

In-vehicle intelligent agent (IVIA), a specialized version of IAs in a vehicle context, is also notable. However, it is hard to well-define user needs and requirements and translate them into actual design features because many factors (user characteristics, task types, road conditions, etc.) are complicated to consider. In this vein, to make a better understanding of the topic, the purposes of this workshop are: 1) to integrate a list of design variables and characteristics of IVIAs, 2) to develop IVIA prototypes especially considering factors of appearances and voices, and 3) to investigate user preferences towards IVIA prototypes under different user scenarios. Through the user-involved design activities, we will seek to contribute the design of IVIAs.},

abstract = {Background: Microservices migrations are challenging and expensive projects with many decisions that need to be made in a multitude of dimensions. Existing research tends to focus on technical issues and decisions (e.g., how to split services). Equally important organizational or business issues and their relations with technical aspects often remain out of scope or on a high level of abstraction.Aims: In this study, we aim to holistically chart the decision-making that happens on all dimensions of a migration project towards microservices (including, but not limited to, the technical dimension).Method: We investigate 16 different migration cases in a grounded theory interview study, with 19 participants that recently migrated towards microservices. This study strongly focuses on the human aspects of a migration, through stakeholders and their decisions.Results: We identify 3 decision-making processes consisting of 22 decision-points and their alternative options. The decision-points are related to creating stakeholder engagement and assessing feasibility, technical implementation, and organizational restructuring.Conclusions: Our study provides an initial theory of decisionmaking in migrations to microservices. It also outfits practitioners with a roadmap of which decisions they should be prepared to make and at which point in the migration.},

Overly clinical therapy games run the risk of being boring, which defeats the purpose of using games to motivate healing in the first place [10, 23]. In this work, we adapt and repurpose an existing immersive virtual reality (iVR) game, Spellcasters, originally designed purely for entertainment for use as a stroke rehabilitation game—which is particularly relevant in the wake of COVID-19, where telehealth solutions are increasingly needed [4]. In preparation for participatory design sessions with stroke survivors, we collaborate with 14 medical professionals to ensure Spellcasters is safe and therapeutically valid for clinical adoption. We present our novel VR sandbox implementation that allows medical professionals to customize appropriate gestures and interactions for each patient’s unique needs. Additionally, we share a co-designed companion app prototype based on clinicians’ preferred data reporting mechanisms for telehealth. We discuss insights about adapting and repurposing entertainment games as serious games for health, features that clinicians value, and the potential broader impacts of applications like Spellcasters for stroke management.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The need for critically reflecting on the deceptive nature of advanced technologies, such as social robots, is urging academia and civil society to rethink education and the skills needed by future generations. The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.},

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.},

In the context of remote reconnaissance, an operator is likely to be supported by computer vision technology, whilst still making the final assessment, with the speed and precision of the classification being key. Within a vast design space with multiple design options, different interaction concepts were explored. One concept is based on gaze, which is tracked using eye tracking technology. It is then indicated if the operator's gaze is on a software identified object and allows an interaction through a secondary input device. To evaluate the concept, a simulator experiment was designed, comparing it to a joystick input. Expert users will complete two equal scenarios using both interaction methods, whilst metrics such as task success are recorded and interviews are conducted, for a balanced analysis of qualitative and quantitative, as well as subjective and objective data.},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.}

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

The quality of these reports has been canonically measured using metrics from the NLP community for language generation such as Machine Translation and Summarization. However, the evaluation metrics (e.g. BLEU, CIDEr) are inappropriate for the medical domain, where clinical correctness is critical. To address this, our team brought together machine learning experts with radiologists for a pilot study in co-designing a better metric for evaluating the quality of an algorithmically-generated radiology report.

abstract = {Under the influence of computer technology, traditional furniture design methods will continue to innovate with the growth of the times. With the advent of computer-aided design tools, automobile manufacturing, furniture and other industries are facing new development opportunities. In recent years, the rapid development of computer-aided design tools has transformed simple functions into powerful integrated design application platforms, and they have already become a vital part of product design. This article mainly focuses on the research of computer-aided furniture design and manufacturing prospects. First, it has made a general understanding of the theory of computer-aided furniture design based on the literature, and then developed the design of the computer-aided furniture design system. The designed system was tested, and the final test results confirmed that the overall evaluation of the system is high. The system's functions and the system's operating interface score above 3, but the system's response time score is low, mainly because the system uses solidworks for 3D modeling.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced workers around the world to switch their working paradigms from on-site to video-mediated communication. Despite the advantages of videoconferencing, diverse circumstances have prevented people from focusing on their work. One of the most typical problems they face is that various surrounding factors distract them during their meetings. This study focuses on conditions in which remote workers are distracted by factors that disturb, interrupt, or restrict them during their meetings. We aim to explore the various problem situations and user needs. To understand users’ pain points and needs, focus group interviews and participatory design workshops were conducted to learn about participants’ troubled working experiences over the past two years and the solutions they expected. Our study provides a unified framework of distracting factors by which to understand causes of poor user experience and reveals valuable implications to improve videoconferencing experiences.},

abstract = {As increasingly powerful natural language generation, representation, and understanding models are developed, made available and deployed across numerous downstream applications, many researchers and practitioners have warned about possible adverse impacts. Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.},

abstract = {The privacy of personal data is a human right that is systematically violated in the computing industry, according to human rights organisations. The vision that technology would help society progress through more computing and more accumulation of personal data is now 30 years old. With the knowledge of today, such a vision would be different. Instead of violating a human right, technologists could use data minimisation as a central pillar of innovation. A compelling amount of evidence shows that the majority of consumers does not feel comfortable with being tracked or profiled. This paper analyses how this vision may be realised through a variety of projects and case examples. The conclusion is that technology without tracking, personal data collection, or personal data analysis, may gradually emerge as the dominant mode of innovation and computing over the next 30 years.},

Using the rhino software and the grasshopper platform to combine quantitative design and genetic algorithm, this paper proposes an interactive design platform to improve residents’ participation in the design stage and reduce residents’ self-demolition and self-construction behavior. This will help improve residents' well-being and reduce pollution and carbon emissions from building consumables.

abstract = {Despite its benefits for children’s skill development and parent-child bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy’s design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy’s usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.},

abstract = {Accountability is widely understood as a goal for well governed computer systems, and is a sought-after value in many governance contexts. But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners. This map reframes existing discussions around accountability and transparency, using the principle of traceability to show how, when, and why transparency can be deployed to serve accountability goals and thereby improve the normative fidelity of systems and their development processes.},

Using entrainment through facilitating interpersonal transmissions of embodied sensations, we present "Frisson Waves" with the aim to enhance live music performance experiences. "Frisson Waves" is an exploratory real-time system to detect, trigger and share frisson in a wave-like pattern over audience members during music performances. The system consists of a physiological sensing wristband for detecting frisson and a thermo-haptic neckband for inducing frisson. In a controlled environment, we evaluate detection (n=19) and triggering of frisson (n=15). Based on our findings, we conducted an in-the-wild music concert with 48 audience members using our system to share frisson. This paper summarizes a framework for accessing, triggering and sharing frisson. We report our research insights, lessons learned, and limitations of "Frisson Waves".},

abstract = {There is growing interest in psychological interventions using socially assistive robots to mitigate distress and pain in the pediatric population. This work seeks to address the deficit in understanding of what features and functionality young children and their parents desire to help with pain management by using co-design, a common approach to exploring participants' imaginations and gathering design requirements. To close this gap, we carried out a co-design workshop involving seven families (with children aged between 4-6 and their parents) to understand their expectations and design preferences for a robot designed for pain management in children. Data were collected from surveys, video and audio recordings, interviews, and field notes. We present the robot prototypes constructed during the workshops and derive several preferences of the children (e.g., zoomorphic shape, distractors and emotional expressions as behaviors). Additionally, we report methodological insights regarding the involvement of young children and their parents in the co-design process. Based on the findings of this co-design study, we discuss personalization as a possible design concept for future child-robot interaction development.},

abstract = {Given a growing concern about the lack of ethical consideration in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, many have begun to question how dominant approaches to the disciplinary education of computer science (CS)---and its implications for AI---has led to the current "ethics crisis". However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of "exclusionary pedagogy," where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as "ethical unicorns" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education.},

This is particularly important as there is a recognised lack of professional ethics direction in programs of study in most curricula. In this paper, it is argued that the subject of human-computer interaction is particularly suitable to serve this role, as it can relate to real life situations more easily than other theoretical or more technical subjects. Examples are provided of teaching interventions that relate the students to critical problems, e.g. to evaluate and re-design web sites of social relevance, design technologies for social inclusion, etc. It is argued that through such approaches of teaching human-computer interaction, computing is situated in a socially relevant context, motivating the students and increasing the learning effect of the teaching intervention.},

People maintain prosocial behaviors long-term only if they make decisions themselves intrinsically as opposed to forced restrictions. To build systems for effecting positive social purpose in pandemic and environmental concerns, we apply speculative design to create story structures and interactions that promote behaviors for social good. We designed stories and interactions using both plot-based narrative frameworks and character-based machine-learning-generated dialogues for effecting cooperation. We then ran a series of workshops investigating how designers negotiate and collaborate to tell stories for social purpose using a "finish each other's stories" approach. This work illustrates the application of design fiction to promote sustainable behavioral patterns that value societal good.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models. However, a growing body of evidence shows that these algorithms may not serve underprivileged communities well and at times discriminate against them. This is all the more concerning in education as negative outcomes have long-term implications. We propose a systematic process for framing, detecting, documenting, and reporting unfairness risks. The systematic approach’s outcomes are merged into a framework named FairEd, which would help decision-makers to understand unfairness risks along the environmental and analytical fairness dimension. The tool allows to decide (i) whether the dataset contains risks of unfairness; (ii) how the models could perform along many fairness dimensions; (iii) whether potentially unfair outcomes can be mitigated without degrading performance. The systematic approach is applied to a Chilean University case study, where a predicting student dropout model is aimed to build. First, we capture the nuances of the Chilean context where unfairness emerges along income lines and demographic groups. Second, we highlight the benefit of reporting unfairness risks along a diverse set of metrics to shed light on potential discrimination. Third, we find that measuring the cost of fairness is an important quantity to report on when doing the model selection.},

abstract = {Context: Evaluating software architectures in uncertain environments raises new challenges, which require continuous approaches. We define continuous evaluation as multiple evaluations of the software architecture that begins at the early stages of the development and is periodically and repeatedly performed throughout the lifetime of the software system. Numerous approaches have been developed for continuous evaluation; to handle dynamics and uncertainties at run-time, over the past years, these approaches are still very few, limited, and lack maturity. Objective: This review surveys efforts on architecture evaluation and provides a unified terminology and perspective on the subject. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and analyse architecture evaluation approaches for uncertainty including continuous and non-continuous, covering work published between 1990–2020. We examined each approach and provided a classification framework for this field. We present an analysis of the results and provide insights regarding open challenges. Major results and conclusions: The survey reveals that most of the existing architecture evaluation approaches typically lack an explicit linkage between design-time and run-time. Additionally, there is a general lack of systematic approaches on how continuous architecture evaluation can be realised or conducted. To remedy this lack, we present a set of necessary requirements for continuous evaluation and describe some examples.},

abstract = {User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design have become an indispensable part of today’s tech industry. Recently, much progress has been made in machine-learning-enabled design support tools for UX designers. However, few of these tools have been adopted by practitioners. To learn the underlying reasons and understand user needs for bridging this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis with 8 UX professionals to understand their practice and identify opportunities for future research. We found that the current AI-enabled systems to support UX work mainly work on graphical interface elements, while design activities that involve more ‘design thinking” such as user interviews and user testings are more helpful for designers. Many current systems were also designed for overly-simplistic and generic use scenarios. We identified 4 areas in the UX workflow that can benefit from additional AI-enabled assistance: design inspiration search, design alternative exploration, design system customization, and design guideline violation check.},

abstract = {One of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence and affective computing is for technology to become emotionally-aware and thus, more human-like. Modeling human emotions is particularly complicated when we consider the lived experiences of people who are on the autism spectrum. To understand the emotional experiences of autistic adults and their attitudes towards common representations of emotions, we deployed a context study as the first phase of a Grounded Design research project. Based on community observations and interviews, this work contributes empirical evidence of how the emotional experiences of autistic adults are entangled with social interactions as well as the processing of sensory inputs. We learned that (1) the emotional experiences of autistic adults are embodied and co-constructed within the context of physical environments, social relationships, and technology use, and (2) conventional approaches to visually representing emotion in affective education and computing systems fail to accurately represent the experiences and perceptions of autistic adults. We contribute a social-emotional-sensory design map to guide designers in creating more diverse and nuanced affective computing interfaces that are enriched by accounting for neurodivergent users.},

abstract = {When designing artificial intelligence (AI) in politicised contexts, such as the public sector, optimistic promises of what AI can achieve often shape decisions around which problems AI should address. Different epistemological views carry different understandings of what is considered the problem at hand, and, as we show in this paper, ethnographic perspectives often fail to match the politicised promises of AI. This paper reflects on personal experiences from an interdisciplinary research project that aimed to take a responsible approach to research and design AI for public services in Denmark. Seeking alternatives to the inflexible algorithms [3, 38] often used to automate or augment specific decision-making tasks in these contexts [1, 2, 35], our research project took a flexible approach to research and design and included ethnographic workplace studies to explore whether AI could both leverage the increasing powers of computing and retain the discretion of the user [23]. Following Mesman [33], we present three empirical moments that were particularly challenging for us as ethnographic researchers and influenced our project in important ways regarding the problems for AI to solve. Problematising [6] them, enabled us to surface how ‘readiness’, emerging from the politicised context of AI in Denmark, had confounded our efforts at interdisciplinary collaboration. Problematisation, then, allowed us to come to a new understanding of the problem at hand and open up a space to collaboratively re-imagine the problems for AI to solve. This paper is in the spirit of serving as a bridge between our initial and revised understanding, pointing to the ongoing discussion in HCI about ‘bridging the gap’ between ethnography and design. Our contribution is a discussion of how researchers and designers might engage with problematisation at the frontiers of HCI to develop an open-ended approach to collaborative AI design in politicised contexts.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {Current robotic systems in surgery are telemanipulators, but the future will likely be more automated. Past and current developments literally put the robotic system at the center of the action, and force the surgical team to adapt to it. In addition to important advantages of robotic surgery, empirical studies identify serious disadvantages in sensory perception and team communication, leading to decreased situational awareness among the surgeon and the team. We therefore raise two interrelated questions: Which actors of a surgical team should be part of a controlled, semi-automated robotic assistance and how should the collaborative interaction between the actors (including the robot) be designed. Previous research has examined the situation awareness in robotic-assisted surgeries with bedside assistant, being either residents or specifically trained registered nurse first assistants, with advantages of one over the other. We built on this work by observing for the first time robotic-assisted surgeries with highly experienced bedside assistants, senior surgeons. We found that a senior surgeon in this role excelled once again, for example, through lively medical discussions and independent problem solving, and was more likely to give us clues about a thoughtful development of semi-autonomous, collaborative surgical robots. These new insights will form the basis for subsequent interviews in which surgical teams will reflect on their expectations of the robotic agency. Our overarching goal is then to translate the results into new user interface designs for robotic surgery through repeated cycles of participatory design workshops and expert evaluations.},

We explore solutions to these challenges in a three-phase design process to create Civil War Twin (CWT), an educational web-based application where users can discover their lookalikes from the American Civil War era (1861--65) while learning more about facial recognition and history. Through this design process, we operationalize a framework for AI literacy, consult with scholars of history, gender, and race, and evaluate CWT in feedback sessions with diverse prospective users. We iteratively formulate design goals to incorporate transparency, inclusivity, speculative design, and empathy into our application. We found that users' perceived learning about the strengths and limitations of facial recognition and Civil War history improved after using CWT, and that our design successfully met users' ethical standards. We also discuss how our ethical design process can be applied to future facial recognition applications.},

abstract = {Employment outcomes for autistic1 individuals are often poorer relative to their neurotypical (NT) peers, resulting in a greater need for other forms of financial and social support. While a great deal of work has focused on developing interventions for autistic children, relatively less attention has been paid to directly addressing the employment challenges faced by autistic adults. One key impediment to autistic individuals securing employment is the job interview. Autistic individuals often experience anxiety in interview situations, particularly with open-ended questions and unexpected interruptions. They also exhibit atypical gaze patterns that may be perceived as, but not necessarily indicative of, disinterest or inattention. In response, we developed a closed-loop adaptive virtual reality (VR)–based job interview training platform, which we have named Career Interview Readiness in VR (CIRVR). CIRVR is designed to provide an engaging, adaptive, and individualized experience to practice and refine interviewing skills in a less anxiety-inducing virtual context. CIRVR contains a real-time physiology-based stress detection module, as well as a real-time gaze detection module, to permit individualized adaptation. We also present the first prototype of the CIRVR Dashboard, which provides visualizations of data to help autistic individuals as well as potential employers and job coaches make sense of the data gathered from interview sessions. We conducted a feasibility study with 9 autistic and 8 NT individuals to assess the preliminary usability and feasibility of CIRVR. Results showed differences in perceived usability of the system between autistic and NT participants, and higher levels of stress in autistic individuals during interviews. Participants across both groups reported satisfaction with CIRVR and the structure of the interview. These findings and feedback will support future work in improving CIRVR’s features in hopes for it to be a valuable tool to support autistic job candidates as well as their potential employers.},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.}

I propose a series of participatory installations exploring the impacts of algorithmic systems, providing contexts for active exploration of these concerns. I will conduct phenomenographic interviews to better understand how visitors experience art installations about technical topics, providing insight for subsequent installations. I will consolidate the results into a set of best practices about engaging the public on these topics.},

abstract = {With the increasing pervasiveness of algorithms across industry and government, a growing body of work has grappled with how to understand their societal impact and ethical implications. Various methods have been used at different stages of algorithm development to encourage researchers and designers to consider the potential societal impact of their research. An understudied yet promising area in this realm is using participatory foresight to anticipate these different societal impacts. We employ crowdsourcing as a means of participatory foresight to uncover four different types of impact areas based on a set of governmental algorithmic decision making tools: (1) perceived valence, (2) societal domains, (3) specific abstract impact types, and (4) ethical algorithm concerns. Our findings suggest that this method is effective at leveraging the cognitive diversity of the crowd to uncover a range of issues. We further analyze the complexities within the interaction of the impact areas identified to demonstrate how crowdsourcing can illuminate patterns around the connections between impacts. Ultimately this work establishes crowdsourcing as an effective means of anticipating algorithmic impact which complements other approaches towards assessing algorithms in society by leveraging participatory foresight and cognitive diversity.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning (DL) approaches have resulted in the dynamic generation of trace links that are far more accurate than was previously possible. However, DL-generated links lack clear explanations, and therefore non-experts in the domain can find it difficult to understand the underlying semantics of the link, making it hard for them to evaluate the link's correctness or suitability for a specific software engineering task. In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic healthcare systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the correctness of the link.},

abstract = {This essay joins recent scholarship in arguing that FAccT's fundamental framing of the potential to achieve the normative conditions for justice through bettering the design of algorithmic systems is counterproductive to achieving said justice in practice. Insofar as the FAccT community's research tends to prioritize design-stage interventions, it ignores the fact that the majority of the contextual factors that practically determine FAccT outcomes happen in the implementation and impact stages of AI/ML lifecycles.We analyze an emergent and widely-cited movement within the FAccT community for attempting to honor the centrality of contextual factors in shaping social outcomes, a set of strategies we term ‘metadata maximalism’. Symptomatic of design-centered approaches, metadata maximalism abstracts away its reliance on institutions and structures of justice that are, by every observable metric, already struggling (where not failing) to provide accessible, enforceable rights. These justice infrastructures, moreover, are currently wildly under-equipped to manage the disputes arising from digital transformation and machine learning. The political economy of AI/ML implementation provides further obstructions to realizing rights. Data and software supply chains, in tandem with intellectual property protections, introduce structural sources of opacity. Where duties of care to vulnerable persons should reign, profit incentives are given legal and regulatory primacy. Errors are inevitable and inextricable from the development of machine learning systems.In the face of these realities, FAccT programs, including metadata maximalism, tend to project their efforts in a fundamentally counter-factual universe: one in which functioning institutions and processes for due diligence in implementation and for redress of harms are working and ready to interoperate with. Unfortunately, in our world, these institutions and processes have been captured by the interests they are meant to hold accountable, intentionally hollowed-out, and/or were never designed to function in today's sociotechnical landscape. Continuing to produce (fair! accountable! transparent!) data-enabled systems that operate in high-impact areas, irrespective of this landscape's radically insufficient paths to justice, given the unavoidability of errors and/or intentional misuse in implementation, and the exhaustively-demonstrated disproportionate distribution of resulting harms onto already-marginalized communities, is a choice - a choice to be CounterFAccTual.},

abstract = {This paper draws attention to new complexities of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to sensitive contexts, such as welfare allocation. AI is increasingly used in public administration with the promise of improving decision-making through predictive modelling. To accurately predict, it needs all the agreed criteria used as part of decisions, formal and informal. This paper empirically explores the informal classifications used by caseworkers to make unemployed welfare seekers 'fit' into the formal categories applied in a Danish job centre. Our findings show that these classifications are documentable, and hence traceable to AI. However, to the caseworkers, they are at odds with the stable explanations assumed by any bureaucratic recording system as they involve negotiated and situated judgments of people's character. Thus, for moral reasons, caseworkers find them ill-suited for formal representation and predictive purposes and choose not to write them down. As a result, although classification work is crucial to the job centre's activities, AI is denuded of the real-world (and real work) character of decision-making in this context. This is an important finding for CSCW as it is not only about whether AI can 'do' decision-making in particular contexts, as previous research has argued. This paper shows that problems may also be caused by people's unwillingness to provide data to systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the empirical results of this research, followed by a discussion of implications for AI-supported practice and research.},

The results show how much all parties truly understand the requirements of the project. A trustworthy requirements prioritization process can ensure that the most important requirements are in line with business needs and should be developed first. The process results in the prioritized list of requirements that support decision making in release planning and subsequent activities to maximize software quality and customer satisfaction. This paper identified strengths and weaknesses of existing RP techniques. That leads to identification of factors in selecting the appropriate RP techniques for software projects. The recommendation can lead to improvement of the existing RP techniques. In addition, this paper presents the survey results of RP techniques used in participating software companies which developed software in Agile Software Development (ASD) context. The results reveal the challenges faced in their RP processes.},

abstract = {Civic technologies are aimed at supporting citizens to participate in democratic processes. Civic robots - social robots that are designed to support people in civic participation - have potential to lower the barriers of participation especially for youth who face obstacles in participating through formal channels. We conducted an exploratory study with adolescents to investigate their perceptions of possible roles for civic robots. In the study, we asked participants of a youth event (n=24, age range 14-21) to ideate civic participation related purposes and concepts for social robots. The findings suggest that scenarios in which a robot serves as social facilitator or provides decision support for civic activities seem promising. In addition, civic robots could indirectly increase participation ability by providing emotional or social support.},

However, the complicated nature of a community’s goals and needs, as well as the complexity of AI’s development procedures, outputs, and potential impacts, often prevents effective participation. In this paper, we present the Model Card Authoring Toolkit, a toolkit that supports community members to understand, navigate and negotiate a spectrum of machine learning models via deliberation and pick the ones that best align with their collective values. Through a series of workshops, we conduct an empirical investigation of the initial effectiveness of our approach in two online communities – English and Dutch Wikipedia, and document how our participants collectively set the threshold for a machine learning based quality prediction system used in their communities’ content moderation applications. Our results suggest that the use of the Model Card Authoring Toolkit helps improve the understanding of the trade-offs across multiple community goals on AI design, engage community members to discuss and negotiate the trade-offs, and facilitate collective and informed decision-making in their own community contexts. Finally, we discuss the challenges for a community-centered, deliberation-driven approach for AI design as well as potential design implications.},

abstract = {Online personalized advertising is often very effective in identifying relevant audiences for each piece of content, which has led to its widespread adoption. In today’s internet, however, these advertising systems are used not only to market products, but also consequential life opportunities such as employment or housing, as well as socially important political messaging. This has led to increasing concerns about the presence of algorithmic bias and possible discrimination in these important domains — with results showing problematic biases along gender, race, and political affiliation, even when the advertiser might have targeted broadly.  A growing body of work focuses on measuring and characterizing these biases, as well as finding ways to mitigate these effects and building responsible systems. However, these results often emerge from different scientific communities and are often disconnected in the literature. In this paper, I attempt at bridging the gap between isolated efforts to either measure these biases, or to mitigate them. I discuss how the need to measure bias in advertising, and the efforts to mitigate it, despite being distant in the literature, are complementary problems that need to center their methodolgy around user studies.  This paper presents a research agenda that focuses on the need for user-centric measurements of bias, by collecting real ads from users, and using surveys to understand user perceptions for these ads. My approach also calls for incorporating user sentiments into the mitigation efforts, by constraining optimization on user values that emerge from surveys. Finally, I also emphasize the need for involving users in the evaluation of responsible advertising systems; efforts to mitigate bias eventually need to be contextualized in terms of benefits to users instead of simple performance tradeoffs. My focus on the users is motivated by the fact that they are stakeholders in personalized advertising, vulnerable at the hand of algorithmic bias and harm, and therefore crucial in both efforts to measure and mitigate these effects.},

We evaluate the interplay between measures of model performance, fairness, and the expected utility of decision-making to offer practical recommendations for the operationalization of algorithmic fairness principles for the development and evaluation of predictive models in healthcare. We conduct an empirical case-study via development of models to estimate the ten-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to inform statin initiation in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. We demonstrate that approaches that incorporate fairness considerations into the model training objective typically do not improve model performance or confer greater net benefit for any of the studied patient populations compared to the use of standard learning paradigms followed by threshold selection concordant with patient preferences, evidence of intervention effectiveness, and model calibration. These results hold when the measured outcomes are not subject to differential measurement error across patient populations and threshold selection is unconstrained, regardless of whether differences in model performance metrics, such as in true and false positive error rates, are present. In closing, we argue for focusing model development efforts on developing calibrated models that predict outcomes well for all patient populations while emphasizing that such efforts are complementary to transparent reporting, participatory design, and reasoning about the impact of model-informed interventions in context.},

Recent work has explored RL methods that optimize a robot’s morphology while learning to control it, effectively dividing an RL agent’s environment into the external world and the agent’s interface with the world. Taking a user-centered design (UCD) approach, we explore the potential of a human, instead of an algorithm, redesigning the agent’s tool. Using UCD to design for a machine learning agent brings up several research questions, including what it means to understand an RL agent’s experience, beliefs, tendencies, and goals. After discussing these questions, we then present a system we developed to study humans designing a 2D racecar for an RL autonomous driver. We conclude with findings and insights from exploratory pilots with twelve users using this system.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

In this paper, we review papers from the conference “Intelligent Virtual Agents” for the last five years (2015 - 2019) to shed light on these questions. The review included 308 short and long papers, with a focus on the interactive aspects of design. The review showed that only 14% of 308 papers explicitly mentioned/referred to user participation during the design of an IVA. User involvement is classified into two categories: one-time and iterative. The few studies that mention design only report on the use of standard Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design methods to a rather limited degree.},

The FairCeptron framework is an approach for studying perceptions of fairness in algorithmic decision making such as in ranking or classification. It supports (i) studying human perceptions of fairness and (ii) comparing these human perceptions with measures of algorithmic fairness. The framework includes fairness scenario generation, fairness perception elicitation and fairness perception analysis. We demonstrate the FairCeptron framework by applying it to a hypothetical university admission context where we collect human perceptions of fairness in the presence of minorities. An implementation of the FairCeptron framework is openly available, and it can easily be adapted to study perceptions of algorithmic fairness in other application contexts. We hope our work paves the way towards elevating the role of studies of human fairness perceptions in the process of designing algorithmic decision making systems.},

This case study reports on the real-world experiences of industry professionals (e.g. designers, program managers, front-end developers) prototyping new ML-powered feature ideas via prompt-based prototyping. Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design: Statistics, Digital Signal Processing, and Machine Learning in Practice provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for novel interaction design methods involving gesture, speech, text, and touch embedded in novel and emerging interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle devices, virtual reality, robotic, the Internet of Things (IoT), brain–computer interaction, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) for interactive systems. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working in interaction design on emerging platforms. This introductory textbook presents theory chapters on statistical grounding, signal processing, and ML foundations for guiding the development of novel interactive systems. Additional chapters discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces (BCI), probabilistic text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, building adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces (UIs). The chapters on case studies also highlight an in-depth look at domain-specific language (DSL) and ML methods used, for example, in touch, gesture, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout is the ubiquitous support for humans as they go about their daily professional or personal activities.This introductory book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal–multisensor systems. After each chapter an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the wider ethical issues on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during interaction with novel platforms.Parisa Eslambolchilar, Andreas Komninos, and Mark D.

A need that is often unaddressed by the robot, due to its limitations in understanding the expressions of children. To keep the child-robot interaction manageable the robot takes control, undermining children's ability to co-regulate the interaction. Co-regulation is important for having a fulfilling social interaction. We developed a co-creation activity that aims to facilitate more co-regulation. Children are enabled to create sound effects, gestures, and light shows for the robot to use during their conversation. Results from a user study (N = 59 school children, 7-11 y.o.) showed that the co-creation activity successfully facilitated co-regulation by improving children's agency. Co-creation furthermore increases children's acceptance of the robot.},

abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) is a bricolage field that requires a concerted effort to ensure that all stakeholders it affects are able to contribute to its development in a meaningful manner. We need mechanisms that support collaborative sense-making. This paper argues that graphical causal models can help us to span the disciplinary divide, providing a new apparatus to help educators understand, and potentially challenge, the technical models developed by LA practitioners as they form. We briefly introduce causal modelling, highlighting its potential benefits in helping the field to move from associations to causal claims, and illustrate how graphical causal models can help us to reason about complex statistical models. The approach is illustrated by applying it to the well known problem of at-risk modelling.},

abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are characterised by impairments in communication. Socially assistive robots have been identified as a promising avenue to alleviate their burden. Since NDDs have different needs, their way of communicating with a robot (e.g., speech-based) could differ among individuals. This paper aims to investigate the most suitable modality to communicate with a robot for NDDs - among voice, cards, and buttons - and explore their opinion on this matter. We ran an exploratory study involving 29 NDDs participants: 13 of them could freely communicate with an autonomous QT robot, 9 took part in a group discussion, and 7 first interacted individually with the robot, and then they participated in a group discussion. Our results showed that i) the cards were the most used communication modality, ii) voice can be used for counting games, buttons for multiple-choice games, and cards for memory-like games, iii) opinions did not differ much among groups.},

abstract = {Despite impressive performance in many benchmark datasets, AI models can still make mistakes, especially among out-of-distribution examples. It remains an open question how such imperfect models can be used effectively in collaboration with humans. Prior work has focused on AI assistance that helps people make individual high-stakes decisions, which is not scalable for a large amount of relatively low-stakes decisions, e.g., moderating social media comments. Instead, we propose conditional delegation as an alternative paradigm for human-AI collaboration where humans create rules to indicate trustworthy regions of a model. Using content moderation as a testbed, we develop novel interfaces to assist humans in creating conditional delegation rules and conduct a randomized experiment with two datasets to simulate in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our study demonstrates the promise of conditional delegation in improving model performance and provides insights into design for this novel paradigm, including the effect of AI explanations.},

An integral part of this turn is the use of the Consul digital platform as the primary means of citizen participation. Using a mixed method approach, this ongoing research paper explores how each of the 32 local authorities that make up Scotland utilise the Consul platform to engage their citizens in the PB process and how they then make sense of citizens' contributions. In particular, we focus on whether natural language processing (NLP) tools can facilitate both citizen engagement, and the processes by which citizens' contributions are analysed and translated into policies.},

However, even though visually impaired (VI) and sighted peers are side by side in the classroom, previous research showed a lack of participation of VI children in classroom dynamics and group activities. That leads to a reduced engagement between VI children and their sighted peers and a missed opportunity to value and explore class members' differences. Robots due to their physicality, and ability to perceive the world, socially-behave and act in a wide range of interactive modalities, can leverage mixed-visual ability children access to group activities while fostering their mutual understanding and social engagement. With this work, we aim to use social robots, as facilitators, to booster inclusive activities in mixed-visual abilities classroom.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has brought changes to every organization to be able to make changes quickly and adaptively. Organizations need to accelerate the use of digital technology which has an impact on changes in business processes. The use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology as software can support the automation of business processes in accordance with the rules of work performed by humans. RPA is a new technology that can be adopted by organizations to achieve various automation goals in the form of accuracy, efficiency, increase productivity and reduce operational costs. This research was conducted at one of the private bank in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the development of robotic process automation (RPA) in order to achieve various organizational automation goals. Data collection is carried out from primary data obtained by company employees who have used RPA and analyzed the condition of business process automation in various work units. In addition, interviews were conducted to identify the requirements for RPA development based on the needs and expectations of the automation objectives of the work unit. Secondary data were also obtained from a literature review on the implementation and benefits of RPA. The results show that the business process automation development company's has implemented 150 units of RPA robots in various work units ranging from operations, human capital, finance, compliance, and others. This research is expected to assist organizations in making decisions on the use of RPA and Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) support in order to achieve automation and digitization of business processes.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers have increasingly deployed autonomous and reliable robots long-term in various social contexts including the home. Our work provides a mixed-method approach for analyzing older adults' long-term robot usage data patterns combining quantitative data of robot usage logs with qualitative descriptions from participants' own experience. Overall, this provides a fuller picture to how older adults use and experience social robots in their homes. Our work involves a robot hosting period for at least a month (up to 12 months) in older adults' homes with an experience debrief session held a month into the robot hosting time period. We propose reflections on the novelty effect with respect to older adults' usage data and highlight feelings of guilt, the robot's proactivity and movement, meeting (or not meeting) user expectations, and the robot's persona as key aspects of the hosting experience that promoted usage or non-usage. Finally, we provide design guidelines for structuring future mixed-method long-term robot usage studies being mindful of ethical considerations in this space.},

Participant presentations shared uses of technologies for ecology, conservation, education, advocacy, and artistic engagement with nature. Through presentations and discussions, we explored opportunities and challenges associated with expanding deployment of sensors, drones, and mobile technologies in the natural world. Designing for natural settings requires collaboration between researchers and practitioners in fields such as animal-computer interaction (ACI), human-computer interaction (HCI), ecology, environmental psychology, arts, conservation technology and environmental management, as well as meaningful inclusion of local communities and non-human stakeholders. As an output of this workshop, we aim to establish a venue for interdisciplinary discussion on the challenges, tensions and ethical issues that arise in designing digital technologies for natural environments.},

abstract = {Elections are the central institution of democratic processes, and often the elected body – in either public or private governance – is a committee of individuals. To ensure the legitimacy of elected bodies, the electoral processes should guarantee that diverse groups are represented, in particular members of groups that are marginalized due to gender, ethnicity, or other socially salient attributes. To address this challenge of representation, we have designed a novel participatory electoral process coined the Representation Pact, implemented with the support of a computational system. That process explicitly enables voters to flexibly decide on representation criteria in a first round, and then lets them vote for candidates in a second round. After the two rounds, a counting method is applied, which selects the committee of candidates that maximizes the number of votes received in the second round, conditioned on satisfying the criteria provided in the first round. With the help of a detailed use case that applied this process in a primary election of 96 representatives in Switzerland, we explain how this method contributes to fairness in political elections by achieving a better “descriptive representation”. Further, based on this use case, we identify lessons learnt that are applicable to participatory computational systems used in societal or political contexts. Good practices are identified and presented.},

abstract = {The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data-driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well-defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Existing work has focused on harassment (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, two key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) detection timeliness, which is necessary to support victims as early as possible, and (ii) scalability to the staggering rates at which content is generated in online social networks. In this work, we introduce CONcISE, a novel approach for timely and accurate Cyberbullying detectiON in online social media SEssions. CONcISE is a two-stage online approach designed to reduce the time to raise a cyberbullying alert by sequentially examining comments as they become available over time, and minimizing the number of feature evaluations necessary for a decision to be made for each comment. Extensive experiments on a real-world Instagram dataset with  users and  comments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and timeliness of our approach and its benefits over existing methods. Additional experiments using a Twitter dataset offer evidence in support of the potential generalizability of CONcISE to other social media platforms.},

abstract = {Diversity-aware platform design is a paradigm that responds to the ethical challenges of existing social media platforms. Available platforms have been criticized for minimizing users' autonomy, marginalizing minorities, and exploiting users' data for profit maximization. This paper presents a design solution that centers the well-being of users. It presents the theory and practice of designing a diversity-aware platform for social relations. In this approach, the diversity of users is leveraged in a way that allows like-minded individuals to pursue similar interests or diverse individuals to complement each other in a complex activity. The end users of the envisioned platform are students, who participate in the design process. Diversity-aware platform design involves numerous steps, of which two are highlighted in this paper: 1) defining a framework and operationalizing the "diversity" of students, 2) collecting "diversity" data to build diversity-aware algorithms. The paper further reflects on the ethical challenges encountered during the design of a diversity-aware platform.},

While personas have been lauded for their benefits, we could locate no prior review of persona use cases in design, prompting the question: how are personas actually used to achieve these benefits? To address this question, we review 95 articles containing persona application across multiple domains, and identify software development, healthcare, and higher education as the top domains that employ personas. We then present a three-stage design hierarchy of persona usage to describe how personas are used in design tasks. Finally, we assess the increasing trend of persona initiatives aimed towards social good rather than solely commercial interests. Our findings establish a roadmap of best practices for how practitioners can innovatively employ personas to increase the value of designs and highlight avenues of using personas for socially impactful purposes.},

However, it is not yet well-understood how risks and ethical considerations of AI relate to children. This paper makes three contributions to this area: first, it identifies ten areas of alignment between general AI frameworks and codes for age-appropriate design for children. Then, to understand how such principles relate to real application contexts, we conducted a landscape analysis of children’s AI systems, via a systematic literature review including 188 papers. This analysis revealed a wide assortment of applications, and that most systems’ designs addressed only a small subset of principles among those we identified. Finally, we synthesised our findings in a framework to inform a new “Code for Age-Appropriate AI”, which aims to provide timely input to emerging policies and standards, and inspire increased interactions between the AI and child-computer interaction communities.},

abstract = {In recent years engineers developing new technologies with assistive or medical purposes have become aware that to create acceptable and usable solutions they need to involve final users, patients and stakeholders in the design, development and evaluation of systems as well as in the device certification processes. Involving stakeholders in such processes has several ethical and legal implications. It has become evident that it is still difficult for engineers in Europe to know which ethical and legal processes should be carried out as they have not been previously trained in these issues during their studies.This article is a review of the laws, standards and recommendations applicable in Europe concerning human involvement in new technologies research, with the aim of helping researchers in the region in question to identify the ethical and legal issues that could arise during those tasks. This review has been carried out in response to the identified need on the part of technological researchers.The design of a flowchart is presented as a summary of the interpretation of the documentation reviewed with the aim of helping the researchers to take the ethical and legal decisions that apply to research involving humans.The flowchart presented has been validated with various research projects in which the authors have participated. The proposed conceptual design can be used for taking decisions, but it is suggested that a tool based on this design be built with the aim of making decision taking easier for researchers in this area.},

abstract = {Electronic health records, as a repository, of patient information, is nowadays the most commonly used technology to record , store and review patient clinical records and perform other clinical tasks. However, the accurate identification and retrieval of relevant information from clinical records is a difficult task due to the unstructured nature of clinical documents, characterized in particular by lack of clear structure. Therefore, medical practice is facing a challenge thanks to rapid growth of health information in electronic health records (EHRs), mostly in narrative text form. As a result, it's becoming important to effectively manage the growing amount of data for a single patient and there is currently a requirement to visualize electronic health records (EHRs) in a way that aids physicians in clinical tasks and medical decision-making. Leveraging text visualization techniques to unstructured clinical narrative texts is a new area of research that aims to provide better information extraction and retrieval to support clinical decision support in scenarios where data generated continues to grow. Clinical datasets in electronic health records (EHR) offer a lot of potential for training accurate statistical models to classify facets of information which can then be used to improve patient care and outcomes. However, in many clinical note datasets, unstructured nature of clinical texts is a common problem. This paper examines to the very issue of getting raw clinical texts and mapping them into meaningful structures that can support healthcare professional utilizes narrative texts. Our work is the result of a collaborative design process that was aided by empirical data collected through formal usability testing.},

To provide additional support for teachers in nurturing this development, we created MindfulNest, a technology tool designed to support 3 to 5 year olds’ development of emotion regulation strategies. We evaluated MindfulNest through a year-long test. We found that students of all ages did not associate particular emotion regulation skills with specific emotions. Younger students struggled to understand complex interactions and occasionally struggled to use the interface, however they were still able to use MindfulNest to regulate their emotions when guided by their teacher. Older students did not struggle to use MindfulNest or understand complex interactions and were able to successfully regulate their emotions by themselves and with teacher guidance.},

This paper advances a systematic literature review on sustainability across the Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction (SHCI) body of work. The papers were classified according to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework to understand how the pillars of SD play into the HCI discourse on sustainability. The economic angle was identified as a gap in SHCI literature. To meet the TBL of SD, however, a balance needs to be sought across all ‘lines’. In this paper, we propose that HCI can advance the discussion and the understanding of the economic concepts around sustainability through taking a sociology perspective on the economic angle of the TBL. We sustain this claim by discussing economic concepts and the role that digital can play in redefining the established foundations of our economic system.},

Specifically we consider (i) use of a social robot to encourage girls to consider studying robotics (and expression of feminist sentiment in this context), (ii) if/how robots should respond to abusive, and antifeminist sentiment and (iii) how ('female') robots can be designed to challenge current gender-based norms of expected behaviour. We demonstrate that whilst there are complex interactions between robot, user and observer gender, we were able to increase girls' perceptions of robot credibility and reduce gender bias in boys. We suggest our work provides positive evidence for going against current digital assistant/traditional human gender-based norms, and the future role robots might have in reducing our gender biases.},

We explain how CLD is a relevant modelling technique for the problem domain of energy systems and why its qualitative nature that highlights interdependencies makes it suitable for use with participant stakeholders. Finally, we illustrate modelling examples relevant to actual project testbed deployments and initial experiment scenarios with the use of the online CLD tool LOOPY.},

Black boxes and intangible entities are omnipresent in our homes and lives without our necessarily understanding the hidden flows of data, unknown agendas, imaginary clouds, and mysterious rules that govern them. Have humanity's ways of relating to the unknown throughout history gone away, or have they perhaps transmuted into new forms? In an ongoing project, we have inventoried examples, encounters and reflections on contemporary technology, framed through the perspective of the haunted, spectral and otherworldly. In this paper, we excerpt this collection to illustrate the value and opportunity of an unfamiliar, disquieting perspective in helping to frame the frictions, beliefs and myths that are emerging around interactions with everyday technologies.

Current methodologies are limited in capturing subjective differences in expectations, needs, and values at work, and they do not lay emphasis on demographic differences, which may impact people's perceptions of job satisfaction. This study proposes an approach to assess job satisfaction by leveraging large-scale social media data. Starting with an initial Twitter dataset of 1.5M posts, we examine two facets of job satisfaction, pay and supervision. By adopting a theory-driven approach, we first build machine learning classifiers to assess perceived job satisfaction with an average AUC of 0.84. We then study demographic differences in perceived job satisfaction by geography, sex, and race in the U.S. For geography, we find that job satisfaction on Twitter exhibits insightful relationships with macroeconomic indicators such as financial wellbeing and unemployment rates. For sex and race, we find that females express greater pay satisfaction but lower supervision satisfaction than males, whereas Whites express the least pay and supervision satisfaction. Unpacking linguistic differences, we find contrasts in different groups' underlying priorities and concerns, e.g., under-represented groups saliently express about basic livelihood, whereas the majority groups saliently express about self-actualization. We discuss the role of frame of reference and the "job satisfaction paradox", conceptualized by organizational psychologists, in explaining our observed differences. We conclude with theoretical and sociotechnical implications of our work for understanding and improving worker wellbeing.},

abstract = {The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.},

NB2Slides uses deep learning methods as well as example-based prompts to generate slides from computational notebooks, and take users’ input (e.g., audience background) to structure the slides. NB2Slides also provides an interactive visualization that links the slides with the notebook to help users further edit the slides. A follow-up user evaluation with 12 data scientists shows that participants believed NB2Slides can improve efficiency and reduces the complexity of creating slides. Yet, participants questioned the future of full automation and suggested a human-AI collaboration paradigm.},

The survey (n=81) investigated which users preferences in four social situations to reduce social anxiety. Using thematic analysis of responses we created a coding scheme of stimuli derived from real-world experiences to emulate with affective haptics. By cross-referencing these categories with affective haptics research, we provide recommendations to designers about which calming stimuli users wish to experience socially and how they can be implemented.},

While much research has focused on how people learn aspects of predefined printing processes, such as expressively utilizing particular design-software (e.g. CAD) and fabrication-machinery (e.g. 3D Printers), this work explores how anyone may gain an understanding of what can be 3D printed through dynamic-processes in computationally-guided exploration of online resources and 3D printing facilities. Investigations surrounding online printing services reveal accessible 3D printing processes that do not require end-users to have experience with design-software or fabrication-machinery, only requiring end-users to specify printable ideas. We present these accessible printing processes alongside associated technologies in a meta-design framework for supporting end-users’ specification of 3D printing ideas. Informed by this framework and a series of formative studies, we designed the website HowDIY to introduce anyone to 3D printing by encouraging and facilitating the intelligent exploration of various online resources. HowDIY was deployed over several weeks with diverse newcomers to 3D printing, validating that intelligent user interfaces can support anyone to participate in the utilization and design of 3D printing tools and processes.},

H2020-VALKYRIES will propose both design and development of a modular, interoperable, scalable and secure-oriented reference integration, called SIGRUN, which will allow the integration between legacy solutions and new technologies in a framework of harmonized solutions. SIGRUN will be able to deploy services and dynamically adapt its behaviour, as the emergency requires it. A series of demonstration scenarios will be developed placing an emphasis on cross-border and cross-sectorial BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) scenarios, where the usual communications infrastructure could have been damaged, and emergency response teams are deployed without an accurate view of the operation environment.},

In this study, we proposed virtual peers - virtual TAs and students that interact with each other as though they are watching the video for the first time together - to help real students learn from observing their interactions. We conducted two rounds of interviews and participatory designs with instructors and TAs to design an authoring tool that would help them create engaging virtual characters and author five types of pedagogically valuable interactions. The design received favorable preliminary feedback from instructors. They expect the tool to add valuable components that are missing from lecture videos with minimal additional effort on their parts.},

abstract = {Child and family care professionals in the Netherlands are facing challenges including high workloads. Technological support could be beneficial in this context, e.g. for education, motivation and guidance of the children. For example, the Dutch Child and Family Center explores the possibilities of social robot assistance in their regular care pathways. To study the use of social robots in this broad context, we started by drafting three example scenarios based on the expertise of child care professionals. During an exploration phase, we are identifying key design and application requirements through focus groups with child care professionals and parents. Later stages of our research, the testing phase, will focus on testing these requirements via scenario-based design and child-robot interaction experiments in real-world contexts to further shape the application of social robots in various child and family care settings.},

abstract = {Supporting personal health with Decision Support Systems&nbsp;(DSS) and, specifically, recommender systems&nbsp;(RS) is a promising and growing area of research. Integrating the user in the loop is vital in such health systems due to the complexity of recommendations, gravity of the decisions and the reliance on user autonomy. However, for such a purpose, to the best of our knowledge there exists no profound or comprehensive framework nor model to guide system designers, to exploit the full potential of integrating users in the system’s reasoning process by design. In this paper, we present a multifaceted user integration framework in personal health-related DSS and RS. This framework, with three main components, has been derived from an iterative mixed-methods development and evaluation procedure, including expert workshops and extensive multidisciplinary literature reviews. Users are accordingly integrated into the whole process from system reasoning until decision making through the following actionable design strategies: (1) Empower: Enabling them to understand the result generation and implications, (2) Encourage: encouraging them to question and reflect system outcomes and to get involved in the generation process and (3) Engage: enabling them to take an active role by facilitating and providing opportunities for user control. The framework offers support to designers of personal health-related DSS and RS in properly integrating users into their systems.},

Taking into account local dynamics and the communicated desires of Black-owned businesses in the Pittsburgh region, we determine that university students represent an under-utilized market for these businesses. We investigate the root causes for this inefficiency and design and implement a platform, 412Connect (https://www.412connect.org/), to increase online support for Pittsburgh Black-owned businesses from students in the Pittsburgh university community. The site operates by coordinating interactions between student users and participating businesses via targeted recommendations. We describe the project from its conception, paying special attention to our motivation and design choices. These choices are aided by two simple models for badge design and recommendation systems that may be of theoretical interest. Along the way, we highlight challenges and lessons from coordinating a grassroots volunteer project working in conjunction with community partners and the opportunities and pitfalls of engaged scholarship.},

abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

abstract = {The growing inequality in gig work between workers and platforms has become a critical social issue as gig work plays an increasingly prominent role in the future of work. The AI inequality is caused by (1) the technology divide in who has access to AI technologies in gig work; and (2) the data divide in who owns the data in gig work leads to unfair working conditions, growing pay gap, neglect of workers’ diverse preferences, and workers’ lack of trust in the platforms. In this position paper, we argue that a bottom-up approach that empowers individual workers to access AI-enabled work planning support and share data among a group of workers through a network of end-user-programmable intelligent assistants is a practical way to bridge AI inequality in gig work under the current paradigm of privately owned platforms. This position paper articulates a set of research challenges, potential approaches, and community engagement opportunities, seeking to start a dialogue on this important research topic in the interdisciplinary CHIWORK community.},

abstract = {Currently, health research increasingly involves diverse groups of stakeholders. Such collaborations occur on various levels, where in some cases, stakeholders become co-researchers. However, these stakeholders (e.g. patients) are not always trained in the necessary research skills. On the other hand, researchers are not trained to collaborate with stakeholders. While there is agreement that skill training should be offered as an integral part of participatory health, so far knowledge is lacking on what such a training should look like. This workshop aims to collect experiences from those who have either previously implemented stakeholder skill training or have experiences where stakeholder skill training was lacking but would have been beneficial, and facilitate the exchange of ideas between participants who are interested in the topic. The outcomes will be communicated in ways that are accessible for academic and non-academic stakeholders and will provide them with guidance for conducting stakeholder skill training.},

It is timely because it allows us to assess the impact of new technologies such as commodity 3D printing and low-cost electronics on the production and presentation of accessible graphics. As expected our review shows an increase in publications from 2014 that we can attribute to these developments. It also reveals the need to: broaden application areas, especially to the workplace; broaden end-user participation throughout the full design process; and conduct more in situ evaluation.

abstract = {More and more voice-user interfaces (VUIs), such as smart speakers like Amazon Alexa or social robots like Jibo or Cozmo, are entering multi-user environments including homes. VUIs can utilize multi-modal cues such as graphics, expressive sounds, and movement to convey social engagement, affecting how users perceive agents as social others. Reciprocal relationships with VUIs, i.e., relationships with give-and-take between the VUI and user, are of key interest as they are more likely to foster rapport and emotional engagement, and lead to successful collaboration. Through an elicitation study with three commercially available VUIs, we explore small group interactions (n = 33 participants) focused on the behaviors participants display to various VUIs to understand (1) reciprocal interactions between VUIs and participants and among small groups and (2) how participants engage with VUIs as the interface's embodiment becomes more socially capable. The discussion explores (1) theories of sociability applied to the users' behaviors seen with the VUIs, and (2) the group contexts where VUIs that build reciprocal relationships with users can become a powerful persuasive technology and a collaborative companion. We conclude the discussion with recommendations for promoting reciprocity from participants and, therefore, fostering rapport and emotional engagement in VUI interactions.},

Through a critical analysis of current HRI design literature, we identify a lack of work dedicated to understanding the conceptual implications of robotic artifacts. These, in fact, are implicit carriers of crucial HRI knowledge that can challenge established assumptions about how a robot should look, act, and be like. We conclude by discussing a set of practices desirable to legitimize designerly HRI work, and calling for further research addressing the conceptual implications designerly HRI work.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades the concept of smart cities has gained a lot of attention amongst researchers, the media, governments, civic groups and citizens. The literature shows that innovations have a more positive impact when they stimulate the development of cities and shape their space for a variety of participants, or when design is participatory. This ensures a non-technocratic approach, i.e., one that builds on the complexity of today's socio-technical systems and the consideration of their individual actors. Citizen-based approaches or one of the so-called Caring Community are possible answers to this. In this Design Fiction workshop, we take a critical view on the idea of smart cities by broadening participation to stakeholders who are still excluded from its concept and can be described as vulnerable and often marginalized, such as people who are (culturally) diverse (e.g. migrants, refugees, older adults, children, currently and formerly incarcerated people, homeless people and those with low income) or neurodiverse (e.g. people living with mental health challenges as autism or dementia or who suffer from functional impairments), and also animals and nature who are left behind in the whole digitization process. In this regard we will also address topics like sustainability and well-being. One of the expected outcomes of this workshop is the development of a holistic and sustainable smart city concept involving currently excluded stakeholders.},

We investigated a novel method of measuring verbalized metacognition by applying natural language processing (NLP) to transcripts of interviews conducted in a classroom with 99 middle school students who were using a computerized learning environment. We iteratively adapted the NLP method for the linguistic characteristics of these interviews, then applied it to study three research questions regarding the relationships between verbalized metacognition and measures of 1) learning, 2) confusion, and 3) metacognitive problem-solving strategies. Verbalized metacognition was not directly related to learning, but was related to confusion and metacognitive problem-solving strategies. Results also suggested that interviews themselves may improve learning by encouraging metacognition. We discuss implications for designing computerized environments that support self-regulated learning through metacognition.},

abstract = {Many characteristics are associated with the development of smart cities (SC), including the use of technologies to cope with complex problems related to the high levels of urbanization in the cities, such as guaranteeing better mobility, environment, and a better quality of life to citizens. In this sense, SC frameworks include, in general, governance and citizen participation as an essential dimension to assess the development of SC, based on the perspective that all stakeholders should share and contribute to solutions and visions for the future of the cities. Considering monitoring as a critical strategy to assess the advancement of SC initiatives, many measurement frameworks were created by different types of institutions and with diverse purposes. In this context, this paper aims to identify how SC measurement frameworks include indicators related to smart governance and citizen participation. Based on previous studies that systematized SC measurement frameworks and their main characteristics, this paper identified the presence of governance and citizen participation indicators, including the classification of approaches addressed by frameworks in this dimension. The methodology is based on desktop research and comparative analysis of SC measurement frameworks. Among the study results, the authors highlighted the lack of transparency of the indicators proposed in the analyzed measurement frameworks and the presence of different concepts and approaches to measure smart governance and citizen participation in SC initiatives.},

abstract = {As the prevalence of stroke survivors increases, the demand for rehabilitative services will rise. While there has been considerable development in robotics to address this need, few systems consider individual differences in ability, interests, and learning. Robots need to provide personalized interactions and feedback to increase engagement, enhance human motor learning, and ultimately, improve treatment outcomes. In this paper, we present 1) our design process of an embodied, interactive robotic system for post-stroke rehabilitation, 2) design considerations for stroke rehabilitation technology and 3) a prototype to explore how feedback mechanisms and modalities affect human motor learning. The objective of our work is to improve motor rehabilitation outcomes and supplement healthcare providers by reducing the physical and cognitive demands of administering rehabilitation. We hope our work inspires development of human-centered robots to enhance recovery and improve quality of life for stroke survivors.},

abstract = {Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.},

abstract = {Studies of algorithmic decision-making in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and related fields of research increasingly recognize an analogy between AI and bureaucracies. We elaborate this link with an empirical study of AI in the context of decision-making in a street-level bureaucracy: job placement. The study examines caseworkers' perspectives on the use of AI, and contributes to an understanding of bureaucratic decision-making, with implications for integrating AI in caseworker systems. We report findings from a participatory workshop on AI with 35 caseworkers from different types of public services, followed up by interviews with five caseworkers specializing in job placement. The paper contributes an understanding of caseworkers' collaboration around documentation as a key aspect of bureaucratic decision-making practices. The collaborative aspects of casework are important to show because they are subject to process descriptions making case documentation prone for an individually focused AI with consequences for the future of how casework develops as a practice. Examining the collaborative aspects of caseworkers' documentation practices in the context of AI and (potentially) automation, our data show that caseworkers perceive AI as valuable when it can support their work towards management, (strengthen their cause, if a case requires extra resources), and towards unemployed individuals (strengthen their cause in relation to the individual's case when deciding on, and assigning a specific job placement program). We end by discussing steps to support cooperative aspects in AI decision-support systems that are increasingly implemented into the bureaucratic context of public services.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has long become reality and contributes to the digital transformation of many industrial domains. IoT technologies are at the core of industry 4.0 application scenarios, contribute to cyber-physical system implementation, smart connected products and new business models exploiting their potential. There is plenty of work on how to specify, design and implement IoT solutions, but a lot of enterprises struggle to create business value from IoT technology because they have difficulties to define the organizational integration. Methodologies for model-driven engineering (MDE) of IoT solutions should encompass both, organizational and system development and integration, but existing model-based approaches focus on the technical perspective. The paper proposes a modeling approach integrated into enterprise modeling techniques to compensate for this lack. The enterprise modeling language 4EM is extended by adding a method component for IoT modeling. The main contributions of this paper are (a) a summary of the state-of-research in the field, (b) an industrial case for model-based IoT development, and (c) a meta-model and tool support for IoT modelling.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous technologies such as mobile software applications (mobile apps) have a tremendous influence on the evolution of the social, cultural, economic, and political facets of life in society. Mobile apps fulfil many practical purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial management, etc. Given the ubiquity of mobile apps in the lives of individuals and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to consider the relationship between human values and the development and deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values requirements.},

We learned what should have been this obvious fact of existence through our collaboration with a group of 7th grade middle school students that we enlisted in a civic design project. The students were nominally tasked with designing new spaces for inter-cultural communication and public reflection on the small island our university campus shares with a small residential community in the middle of one of the most capitalized urban landscapes in the modern world. Why did it take a group of young middle schoolers to help us as design researchers recognize the significance of destruction as a design move? How can we use this experience to inform our discussion of politics in design, where the interesting question is not whether a design has politics or not, but what politics a specific design proposal does manifest (in this case, the destruction of an artifact), and how such acts can help surface the underlying tensions within a society or community? These are some of the questions that we probe in reflecting on this episode from the perspective of design.},

Visiting several hutongs and communities in Beijing, the design team conducted in-depth interviews with the elderly, with the medical staff doing the same in community hospitals and pharmacies. The service and production system design was used to classify the user population and describe the current aging phenomenon. There are still many challenges faced by the elderly community, such as self-care, nutrition, and scheduling appointments. In this paper, by examining elderly individuals' daily lives and medical challenges, our design team created user journey maps and discovered specific problems in the service process. We extracted the design touchpoints in the user experience, analyzed the user behavior, and discovered some design opportunities. We also expect that service design thinking and design morphology research methods will create innovative and optimized solutions for current aging community medical problems. This provides for on-site services such as diagnosis and treatment, nursing, and prescription and meal delivery for homebound elderly people and proposes a new model of mobile auxiliary medical system intervention in the aging community. This makes the elderly-community-product-environment more sustainable.},

abstract = {Emergent communication has made strides towards learning communication from scratch, but has focused primarily on protocols that resemble human language. In nature, multi-agent cooperation gives rise to a wide range of communication that varies in structure and complexity. In this work, we recognize the full spectrum of communication that exists in nature and propose studying lower-level communication. Specifically, we study emergent implicit signaling in the context of decentralized multi-agent learning in difficult, sparse reward environments. However, learning to coordinate in such environments is challenging. We propose a curriculum-driven strategy that combines: (i) velocity-based environment shaping, tailored to the skill level of the multi-agent team; and (ii) a behavioral curriculum that helps agents learn successful single-agent behaviors as a precursor to learning multi-agent behaviors. Pursuit-evasion experiments show that our approach learns effective coordination, significantly outperforming sophisticated analytical and learned policies. Our method completes the pursuit-evasion task even when pursuers move at half of the evader's speed, whereas the highest-performing baseline fails at 80% of the evader's speed. Moreover, we examine the use of implicit signals in coordination through position-based social influence. We show that pursuers trained with our strategy exchange more than twice as much information (in bits) than baseline methods, indicating that our method has learned, and relies heavily on, the exchange of implicit signals.},

abstract = {IoT devices can monitor the health, safety, and security of aging adults, and automate many household tasks, enabling independence far into old age. However, such devices also have many inherent vulnerabilities, which make them a popular target for cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices and their interactions may make them susceptible to new types of attacks, and also make usability difficult for the aging population. Furthermore, the elderly may be particularly vulnerable and uncomfortable with new technologies. Existing network management interfaces are designed for domain experts, and are impracticable for non-technical users. We propose an agenda for exploring the design of (1) interfaces and guidelines to enable senior users to manage the security posture of IoT devices, and (2) security tools that identify such issues and collaborate with the user to resolve them. We structure this agenda around the core concepts of autonomy, control, and delegation, summarized by the concept of explainable stewardship. We argue that goal (1) must be addressed with qualitative studies of user attitudes towards prototype interfaces. Goal (2) requires the integration of existing network anomaly detection algorithms into techniques which can summarize and explain their meaning. Much remains to be done to ensure older users can take advantage of smart devices without suffering cybersecurity incidents. We hope this article can act as a call for further research in this field.},

abstract = {Neurofeedback games are an effective and playful approach to enhance certain social and attentional capabilities in children with autism, which are promising to become widely accessible along with the commercialization of mobile EEG modules. However, little industry-based experiences are shared, regarding how to better design neurofeedback games to fine-tune their playability and user experiences for autistic children. In this paper, we review the experiences we gained from industry practice, in which a series of mobile EEG neurofeedback games have been developed for preschool autistic children. We briefly describe our design and development in a one-year collaboration with a special education center involving a group of stakeholders: children with autism and their caregivers and parents. We then summarize four concrete implications we learnt concerning the design of game characters, game narratives, as well as gameplay elements, which aim to support future work in creating better neurofeedback games for preschool children with autism.},

(2) What kinds of projects do youth create in Scratch to address critical issues in computing? and (3) How do youth reflect on the learning activity and make changes to implement it with their peers? In the discussion, we address what we learned about co-designing a critical computing learning activity with youth.},

abstract = {Does everyone equally benefit from computer vision systems? Answers to this question become more and more important as computer vision systems are deployed at large scale, and can spark major concerns when they exhibit vast performance discrepancies between people from various demographic and social backgrounds. Systematic diagnosis of fairness, harms, and biases of computer vision systems is an important step towards building socially responsible systems. To initiate an effort towards standardized fairness audits, we propose three fairness indicators, which aim at quantifying harms and biases of visual systems. Our indicators use existing publicly available datasets collected for fairness evaluations, and focus on three main types of harms and bias identified in the literature, namely harmful label associations, disparity in learned representations of social and demographic traits, and biased performance on geographically diverse images from across the world. We define precise experimental protocols applicable to a wide range of computer vision models. These indicators are part of an ever-evolving suite of fairness probes and are not intended to be a substitute for a thorough analysis of the broader impact of the new computer vision technologies. Yet, we believe it is a necessary first step towards (1) facilitating the widespread adoption and mandate of the fairness assessments in computer vision research, and (2) tracking progress towards building socially responsible models. To study the practical effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed indicators to any visual system, we apply them to “off-the-shelf” models built using widely adopted model training paradigms which vary in their ability to whether they can predict labels on a given image or only produce the embeddings. We also systematically study the effect of data domain and model size. The results of our fairness indicators on these systems suggest that blatant disparities still exist, which highlight the importance on the relationship between the context of the task and contents of a datasets. The code will be released to encourage the use of indicators.},

These transformations generated and are continuously generating new challenges for managing public organizations which cannot focus only on administrative efficiency but have to embrace a broader set of values. In this scenario, the adoption of digital technologies within governments could potentially have disrupting effects, both positive and negative. However, despite the general hype, few public organizations have actually realised all the potential associated with the adoption of digital technologies as values enablers: this study aims to investigate the topic by examining how it has evolved throughout the years and organizing the state-of-the-art of the scientific literature on public values creation through e-Government projects. Based on the literature review, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding the factors that are related and influence e-Government implementation and its benefits. Findings suggest that before considering the implementation of an e-Government project, and thus the achievement of specific benefits, a set of different variables should be addressed.},

abstract = {High Quality Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is what the incoming graphics technology era demands: users around the world, regardless of their hardware and network conditions, can all enjoy the immersive virtual experience. However, the state-of-the-art software-based mobile VR designs cannot fully satisfy the realtime performance requirements due to the highly interactive nature of user's actions and complex environmental constraints during VR execution. Inspired by the unique human visual system effects and the strong correlation between VR motion features and realtime hardware-level information, we propose Q-VR, a novel dynamic collaborative rendering solution via software-hardware co-design for enabling future low-latency high-quality mobile VR. At software-level, Q-VR provides flexible high-level tuning interface to reduce network latency while maintaining user perception. At hardware-level, Q-VR accommodates a wide spectrum of hardware and network conditions across users by effectively leveraging the computing capability of the increasingly powerful VR hardware. Extensive evaluation on real-world games demonstrates that Q-VR can achieve an average end-to-end performance speedup of 3.4x (up to 6.7x) over the traditional local rendering design in commercial VR devices, and a 4.1x frame rate improvement over the state-of-the-art static collaborative rendering.},

However, the integration and validation of such targeted maritime transport security services is a complex task that has its own challenges. In this paper we present the preliminary results of the maritime transport security services demonstrator, developed under the CyberSecurityForEurope (CS4EU) pilot project. We have set up a demonstrator to integrate, extend and validate four maritime-specific security services, covering risk and threat management, system hardening, trust management and secure communications. Our goal is to enhance the provisioning of these services and to identify possible research and implementation gaps.},

However, many such games developed to date have not been designed for long-term use. To address this issue, we developed Apraxia World, a speech therapy game specifically intended to be played over extended periods. In this study, we examined pronunciation improvements, child engagement over time, and caregiver and automated pronunciation evaluation accuracy while using our game over a multi-month period. Ten children played Apraxia World at home during two counterbalanced 4-week treatment blocks separated by a 2-week break. In one treatment phase, children received pronunciation feedback from caregivers and in the other treatment phase, utterances were evaluated with an automated framework built into the game. We found that children made therapeutically significant speech improvements while using Apraxia World, and that the game successfully increased engagement during speech therapy practice. Additionally, in offline mispronunciation detection tests, our automated pronunciation evaluation framework outperformed a traditional method based on goodness of pronunciation scoring. Our results suggest that this type of speech therapy game is a valid complement to traditional home practice.},

We examine the conceptual, critical, and creative engagement opportunities in 340+ Hour of Code activities offered to youth during the 2021 CS Education Week. Our analysis shows that while most activities (90.26%) were designed for conceptual engagement with computing, only 11.46% provided opportunities for creative engagement, while only 1.15% promoted critical engagement with the discipline. We discuss future directions for designing, curating, and implementing Hour of Code activities that promote computational empowerment among youth.},

While these robots can assist all types of users, current implementations often rely on users visually rendezvousing with the robot, which may be a challenge for people with visual impairments. This paper describes a proof of concept for a robotic system that addresses this kind of short-range rendezvous for users with visual impairments. We propose to use a lattice graph-based Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) planner as a global planner to discourage the robot from turning in place at its goal position, making its path more human-like and safer. We also interviewed an Orientation &amp; Mobility (O&amp;M) Specialist for their thoughts on our planner. They observed that our planner produces less obtrusive trajectories to the user than the ROS default global planner and recommended that our system should allow the robot to approach the person from the side as opposed to the front as it currently does. In the future, we plan to test our system with users in-person to better validate our assumptions and find additional pain points.},

The final corpus of 46 frameworks were analysed using a coding scheme derived from purposefully selected learning analytics frameworks. The results found that learning analytics frameworks share a number of elements and characteristics such as source, development and application focus, a form of representation, data sources and types, focus and context. Less than half of the frameworks consider student data privacy and ethics. Finally, while design and process elements of these frameworks may be transferable and scalable to other contexts, users in different contexts will be best-placed to determine their transferability/scalability.},

However, it remains unclear how professional writers themselves might want to integrate technology into their existing writing practices. In this work we ran an elicitation study, asking 14 professional poets to consider how they would make use of computation in the context of a custom, interactive writing interface or “Poetry Machine.” We found that the poets desired a wide range of functions, from presenting auditory responses to deleting random words. We also found that many poets did not simply report what their ideal interface would do but rather contextualized their designs by describing why they are artistically meaningful, sometimes with respect to specific literary influences and traditions. We present an initial analysis of the elicitation study and observe some differences between the Poetry Machine designs and existing creativity support tools. This study lays the groundwork for a second phase where we will build a selection of the machines and study how the poets use them over time.},

abstract = {Ability-based design is a useful framework that centralizes the abilities (all that users can do) of people with disabilities in approaching the design of assistive technologies. However, although this framework aspires to support designing with people with all kinds of disabilities, it is mainly effective in supporting those whose abilities can be clearly defined and measured, in particular, physical and sensory attributes of ability. As a result, the ability-based design framework only provides limited guidance to design with users with intellectual disability, whose cognitive, physical, sensory, and practical abilities vary along a spectrum. In this article, we reflect on a long-term co-design study where we leveraged what we termed “competencies,” i.e., the representative practical skills people develop from their participation in life activities, in particular, mainstream technologies, such as social media and the Internet. Our reflection is based on our experience in designing SkillsTube, a web application we co-designed with young adults with intellectual disability to support them to learn life skills through videos. The app's design, which explored and leveraged their social media participation competencies, supported the fundamental participation of all participants and their peers. Their familiarity with the app's social media-inspired design features fostered confidence in their participation, usability, and engagement. Drawing on the findings and design process of the app, we discuss a Competency-based approach to designing with people with disabilities that extends upon ability-based design, by grounding it in user competencies.},

abstract = {Extensive research on mobile guides for museums has explored the potential of technology to offer some of the services that have been traditionally provided by human guides, including guiding visitors in the museum space, providing information about the exhibits, and using more advanced interpretative approaches such as digital storytelling and gamified techniques. However, the majority of these approaches either ignores or tries to substitute entirely the role of the human guide. In this work, we present a user study with 10 experienced tour guides, currently working in the museum of modern art of the Basil &amp; Elise Goulandris Foundation. Based on a three-phase procedure, the study is designed to empower professionals into envisaging their work in symbiosis with current technological developments. First, we attempt to identify existing challenges guides face and to capture their tacit knowledge in addressing emerging problems in guided tours. In the second and third stage, through a reflective and productive discussion, we employ a set of contemporary innovative digital applications as a starting point to elicit their views on their role in an envisaged symbiotic future of human-led hybrid digital experiences.},

abstract = {Mobile virtual reality (VR) is expected to be a key component of the next-generation industrial internet-of-things, which uses immersive technologies to boost virtualization and facilitate human-machine collaboration in Industry 5.0. In this paper, we design a VR content delivery scheme to enhance VR content playback quality in mobile edge computing. The proposed scheme schedules computing resources on network edge to satisfy VR content requests from multiple user devices while reducing the likelihood of rebuffering and improving content freshness during VR video playback. With limited computing resources at the edge server, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to determine which requests should be satisfied first, given the network and the service dynamics. By analyzing the network dynamics using the Whittle index method, the proposed DRL-based scheme can improve VR service quality with minimal communication overhead in computing scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the quality of service for VR content delivery.},

Design contributions of groups marginalized along race and class are often othered, and rarely considered the design standard. While frameworks have emerged to encourage attention to gender and social justice in design, little work has acknowledged evidence of the Black imaginary in this process. The current canon of design defines futuring and speculation as stemming from a narrow view of science fiction, one which does not include Black futurist perspectives. In this essay, we expand the canon of design by arguing that frameworks such as Afrofuturism, Afrofuturist feminism, and Black feminism be considered instrumental in design’s imagining of our future technological landscape. We contribute to the larger conversation of who gets to future in design, suggesting a dialogic relationship between those who conceptualize design and those who consider design’s societal impact.},

As such, both concepts offer the vision of an altered relationship between public administration and its non-public actors by emphasizing a strong position of non-public actors for public service delivery. This research aims to identify the relevance of NPG to leading blockchain implementations in the European public sector. For this purpose, both topics are combined in an explorative analysis. The analysis leverages an adapted analysis framework designed for this research effort to structure the expectations around NPG. Qualitative interviews with multiple key stakeholders of blockchain implementations projects were conducted to understand the actual impact of blockchain on the actor's relationships for public service delivery. This article presents the findings to this question and concludes that the use of blockchain has the changed actor relationships only in parts. Consequently, the author finally draws attention to the importance of blockchain governance and blockchain regulation for further developing the relationships of public administrations and their non-public counterparts.},

Similar to other Assistive Technologies (AT), our facial input technique is also designed and tested in collaboration with a graduate student who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has become a mainstream opportunity to develop immersive environments where people are exposed to relevant stimuli in a systematic but safe way. Besides the controlled exposure to stimuli, VR systems enable a more efficient and unbiased gathering of information with practical applications in diagnosis, intervention, and health monitoring processes. Nonetheless, scientific literature has demonstrated that interacting with VR technology and its peripherals can be challenging, especially in populations less familiar with technology (e.g., older adults) or with clinical conditions that are not adequately accommodated by the technology, such as cognitive (e.g., dementia) or physical impairments (e.g., blindness). This workshop will focus on systems, technological approaches, and theoretical frameworks to develop user/patient-centred VR tools for diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of health and wellbeing outcomes. Moreover, we welcome work focused on accessibility issues, aiming to promote equal access and opportunity to use VR tools by people with diverse abilities.},

Through a review of 38 research papers, this work maps trends, themes, and methods of empirical research on children and CAs in HCI research over the last decade. A thematic analysis of the research found that work in this domain focuses on seven key topics: ascribing human-like qualities to CAs, CAs? support of children?s learning, the use and role of CAs in the home and family context, CAs? support of children?s play, children?s storytelling with CA, issues concerning the collection of information revealed by CAs, and CAs designed for children with differing abilities. Based on our findings, we identify the needs to account for children’s intersectional identities and linguistic and cultural diversity and theories from multiple disciples in the design of CAs, develop heuristics for child-centric interaction with CAs, to investigate implications of CAs on social cognition and interpersonal relationships, and to examine and design for multi-party interactions with CAs for different domains and contexts.},

Human–robot cooperation was studied through ethnographic fieldwork relating to mobile service robots and hospital kitchen staff. The results highlighted problems arising through the assumption that the ‘plug and play’ service robots could effectively automate work tasks. The analysis revealed the complexity of human–robot interaction in dynamic work settings such as hospitals and identified contradictions between the envisioning and realisation of robots at work, as well as the visible and invisible procedures underpinning human–robot cooperation. Consequently, we emphasise the importance of considering robots as agents of change and draw attention to the new work practices that arise when robots assume the roles of workers in dynamic work settings.},

While many use AAC effectively, much research has highlighted challenges – for instance, high rates of abandonment and solutions which are not appropriate for their end-users. Presently, we lack a detailed survey of this field to comprehend these shortcomings and understand how the accessibility community might direct its efforts to design more effective AAC. In response to this, we conduct a systematic review and taxonomy of high-tech AAC devices and interventions, reporting results from 562 articles identified in the ACM DL and SCOPUS databases. We provide a taxonomical overview of the current state of AAC devices – e.g. their interaction modalities and characteristics. We describe the communities of focus explored, and the methodological approaches used. We contrast findings in the broader accessibility and HCI literature to delineate future avenues for exploration in light of the current taxonomy, offer a reassessment of the norms and incumbent research methodologies and present a discourse on the communities of focus for AAC and interventions.},

In HCI, earlier work explored how problematic behaviors emerging from gender biases (e.g., toxicity) negatively impact female participation in esports. Here, we further explore gender biases in esports by interviewing 19 self-identified female and male professional gamers and event organizers. We inquire our interviewees about personal experiences with gender biases in esports and their perspective on how these biases impact participation, inclusivity, and career prospects. Our interviewees see gender biases in esports as a consequence of stereotypical gender roles in gaming tout-court (e.g., girls do not like violence, boys are competitive by nature). The rationale for separating male and female in esports, however, seems rooted in the need for female gamers to create role-models and grow in self-confidence. We scrutinize the considerations emerging from our interviews under a Feminist HCI lens and discuss how HCI research can help design equitable environments in esports.},

As a result of current Covid-19 social distancing requirements, the move from live instruction and investigation to remote workshops poses both creative and technical challenges. This requires a rethink of what, and how, data is collected. This paper considers these issues applied to an early-stage research project in human–object based movement. The project integrates theatre and dance with computer vision tools, to create new, live theatrical experiences. The first case study focuses on human–object movement using improvised theatre methods, before the computer vision component is introduced to the participants. Issues facing remote workshops include restructuring to accommodate improvisation, devised theatre, and creative collaboration. Physical space and safety, camera issues, spatial awareness, impact on improvisational practices, data limitations and quality are also challenges for the project. Input is invited from the HCI community on the issues raised and the feasibility of the proposed methods, as we prepare to run our study.},

To investigate how this whirlwind of rage, inquiry, and accountability affects the lives of tech workers, we conducted interviews with 19 tech workers. Our methodological approach and contribution adopts a style of writing and analysis associated with anthropologist Kathleen Stewart, where we focus on the affective textures of everyday life in an attempt to redirect the temptation to representational thinking to a slowed ethnographic practice. This paper dwells on the affects of tech workers facing critique and scrutiny. Through this approach, we find that emotional habitus conditions the possibilities of personal and political action and inaction in response to critique. By emotional habitus, we refer to the emotional dispositions honed among tech workers by tech culture's rationality and optimism. This habitus must shift if people are to access new ways of relating and acting. We argue for more fruitful attitudes and practices in relation to critique.},

abstract = {The centenaries of former chapters of the British Music Society (BMS), established in 1918, have prompted their governing bodies to take stock of their histories and build on the cataloguing, documentation and preservation of their archival collections. The InterMusE project aims to support this shared instinct to archive by capturing and, crucially, linking different forms of data regarding the musical events provided by three of these local concert-giving organisations, beginning with the digitisation of their collections and with a view to producing a dynamic, open-access digital archive. This paper outlines our approach to establishing a foundation for developing a new kind of digital archive for musicology that is both valuable for researchers, fulfils the needs of the societies and their communities, and sheds light on community music-making on a national and, ultimately, international scale. By carrying out a series of preliminary scoping exercises, including informal interviews and archival-collection assessments, we can compare current archiving and preservation activities across the societies. These conversations bring emerging themes, issues and challenges into focus, raising pertinent questions that will inform our development of transformative tools and techniques for community digitisation projects.},

abstract = {Transparency over algorithmic systems is increasingly asked for, though it is unclear how it can be realised in practice. Transparency is largely recognised as helpful – eg. to redress information asymmetries – but not as an end in and of itself. Understanding how transparency can be meaningful to users, as well as the challenges and design methods to improve transparency at the interface level is therefore key to make algorithmic systems more usefully transparent for users. As part of the DIS ’22 Doctoral Consortium, I am presenting my PhD research on visualising meaningful transparency for users. We are exploring the role of visualisation as a lever to make system transparency more meaningful to users. We consider transparency from a broad socio-technical and systemic perspective, with HCI and Art History research methods. We focus on user interfaces, as they are the key point of interaction between users and systems. By analysing the status quo and various users’ transparency needs, we highlight challenges regarding current practices and transparency guidelines, but also offer practical leads to improve algorithmic system transparency for users.},

In the meantime, there are confusions around definitions of service design and its relevance to HCI. Despite the co-existence of interests and confusions, little research has been done for a comprehensive overview of how HCI interprets and adopts service design. This research performed a systematic literature review on extant HCI publications that claim to use service design. The review findings from the 179 publications revealed varying dimensions of service design taken up in HCI, relations between service design scopes and emerging technologies, as well as unclarity to service design in HCI and HCI's current tendency to use service design for the interaction level rather than the system level. We discuss future design and research opportunities for HCI by integrating the system level dimensions of service design.},

abstract = {Engaging local communities is essential to safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH). To better encourage the participation of local communities, especially younger generations, e.g., students, ICH experience and education workshops are widely adopted by academia, museums, governments, and non-profit organizations. The expected outcomes of these workshops, such as archives, documents, and even creative design solutions, can benefit the promotion and preservation of ICH. However, because of the steep learning curve of using traditional ICH tools and the lack of interactions between students and ICH practitioners, many ICH workshops currently fail to engage students in learning ICH-related knowledge, developing empathy with ICH, or designing novel artifacts with ICH elements. To bridge this gap, we designed a workshop, which integrated ICH in China, digital fabrication, creative technology, and making, to engage Chinese students with ICH and creative design. We conducted empirical studies to collect feedback from students (N = 30) and ICH professionals (N=6). The application of digital fabrication tools successfully piqued students’ interest in ICH and enabled them to create interactive ICH artifacts through quick prototyping. However, the ICH professionals pointed out several issues of using digital fabrication, especially regarding tacit knowledge, use of traditional tools, and cultural authenticity. We discuss the importance of these factors in students’ acquisition of ICH knowledge and ICH-oriented design, and provide implications for future ICH design workshops.},

While online tools enable communication and collaboration, some specific domains involving contemporary technology-based systems, such as Socioenactive systems, demand a deeper understanding of human embodied action in real-world scenarios with ubiquitous technology. This work addresses this issue by presenting a study in which a research team used the OpenDesign Platform to conduct a process of ideation and consolidation of a socioenactive system solution during pandemics and physical presence limitations. The contributions are twofold, addressing the demands of the research team working remotely and envisaging an interaction scenario for people in a socioenactive system, even without their copresence in the same physical space. Results have shown the strengths and weaknesses of the OpenDesign Platform and lessons learned towards supporting systems for teamwork in such systems’ ideation context.},

Despite efforts to include their voices in technology research and design, many older adults have yet to actualize these health benefits, with barriers of access and proficiency actually widening the gap of health inequities. We reviewed 174 HCI publications through a systematic review to examine who is engaged in the design of health technologies for older adults, methods used to engage them, and how different types of participation might impact design directions. Findings highlight that thus far, many identity dimensions have not been explored in HCI aging research. We identify research gaps and implications to promote expanding research engagement with these dimensions as a way to support the design of health technologies that see better adoption among marginalized populations.},

abstract = {Thinking of technology as a design material is appealing. It encourages designers to explore the material’s properties to understand its capabilities and limitations—a prerequisite to generative design thinking. However, as a material, AI resists this approach because its properties only emerge as part of the user experience design. Therefore, designers and AI engineers must collaborate in new ways to create both the material and its application experience. We investigate the co-creation process through a design study with 10 pairs of designers and engineers. We find that design ‘probes’ with user data are a useful tool in defining AI materials. Through data probes, designers construct designerly representations of the envisioned AI experience (AIX) to identify desirable AI characteristics. Data probes facilitate divergent design thinking, material testing, and design validation. Based on our findings, we propose a process model for co-creating AIX and offer design considerations for incorporating data probes in AIX design tools.},

abstract = {The purpose of constructing the knowledge graph of electromechanical equipment is to make full use of the data and information carried by electromechanical equipment, constructing the knowledge association between each independent equipment. The knowledge graph of electromechanical equipment uses a structured way to express the relationship between concepts and entities in electromechanical equipment, and uses this form for data storage and computational reasoning. This can simplify the design of the electromechanical system and improve the efficiency of knowledge reasoning and knowledge calculation. However, due to the complex structure, high correlation and large amount of information of electromechanical equipment, the constructed knowledge graph of electromechanical equipment often has the problem of insufficient association expression and sparse information. Especially lack of expression of its hierarchical relationship. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical relationship construction method based on electromechanical equipment, which is specifically used to extract the information about the physical model, logical model and geometric model of power distribution equipment, electrical equipment, cables, and pipelines in electromechanical equipment, constructing a Hierarchical knowledge graph. The hierarchical relationship construction method is mainly through the integration of logical and physical levels, hierarchical structure of electromechanical equipment data and data clustering as an important feature, so as to obtain stable and hierarchical characteristics of electromechanical equipment knowledge graph. At the same time, the hierarchical features can further complete the construction of the knowledge graph, thereby improving the structure of the knowledge graph and efficiency of the reasoning engine.},

abstract = {Using maps has become a daily activity for virtually everyone. However, in terms of interactive maps are limited. Rich interaction, such as issuing a complex query: “Which route has more greenery for my evening run?” is currently impossible to process for most Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To enable such rich interaction, data in GIS needs to be extended with high-level semantic annotations. Such annotations, due to their intrinsic semantic nature, can currently only be supplied by humans, who might moreover also need to have some expert knowledge about GIS in order to produce useful annotations. Given the cognitive resources required, the number of annotations to be made, and the tediousness of the task, there is a need to design systems that can support experts in completing such annotation tasks. We report on a study comparing two alternative systems for performing GIS annotations, a Conversational User Interface (CUI), designed for the purpose of this study, and a Web interface with NN GIS, which reflects the current state-of-the-art used by experts. We find that CUIs can indeed help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the annotations. We conclude the paper with some tentative design principles for annotation systems coupled to complex user interfaces.},

Identity resolution and Digital twin each realize the "symbiosis and same growth" of products in the two dimensions of data and model. For the Product entire life cycle, the use of different rules for encoding information between companies will hinder the sharing of the Digital twin model, which will subsequently increase the difficulty of constructing the Digital twin scene. This article proposes a combination of identity resolution and digital twin, which has broken the barriers to data flow between enterprises. Finally, to realize the model sharing between different enterprises. In the field of aviation manufacturing, the two are organically combined. Use the IIoT platform to establish a full-element, multi-scale product twin model. Apply it to the full life cycle management of Aviation products and target several important life stages of Aviation products.

We present a five-month mixed-methods ethnographic study in a special-education school to explore the facilitators and barriers experienced by those using technology, with children who have little or no functional speech, to stimulate communication and language comprehension. Our analysis supports the outcomes of earlier studies, but also furnishes novel insights into the scale and urgency of addressing the problem—with implications for user-centred design within this community. We highlight infrastructure, policy, and recruitment deficits, and propose a two-fold solution: (i) an increase in engagement with this population through the provision of enhanced, user-centred support; and (ii) induction of the cross-disciplinary role of Assistive Technologist, to serve as mediator between teacher, aided communicator, and their assistive technology. This work represents a contribution towards establishing more effective operational, interactional, and pedagogical support for learners using high-tech communication devices.},

We describe the participatory approach used in designing the Apprise system and summarize key findings from the study's baseline, mid-line, and endline assessments. We then discuss lessons learned around negotiating the trade-offs that arose between various stakeholders with competing interests and the practical challenges faced in the study context. Technology solutions such as Apprise cannot address the systematic shortcomings of victim identification throughout the Thai fishing sector, but our findings support that technology can play a role in overcoming challenges specifically in the areas of communication, privacy, trust and training.},

abstract = {One of the ultimate goals of several learning analytics (LA) initiatives is to close the loop and support students’ and teachers’ reflective practices. Although there has been a proliferation of end-user interfaces (often in the form of dashboards), various limitations have already been identified in the literature such as key stakeholders not being involved in their design, little or no account for sense-making needs, and unclear effects on teaching and learning. There has been a recent call for human-centred design practices to create LA interfaces in close collaboration with educational stakeholders to consider the learning design, and their authentic needs and pedagogical intentions. This paper addresses the call by proposing a question-driven LA design approach to ensure that end-user LA interfaces explicitly address teachers’ questions. We illustrate the approach in the context of synchronous online activities, orchestrated by pairs of teachers using audio-visual and text-based tools (namely Zoom and Google Docs). This study led to the design and deployment of an open-source monitoring tool to be used in real-time by teachers when students work collaboratively in breakout rooms, and across learning spaces.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of technology has enabled us to perform complex, interdependent, and geographically distributed work. As a result, the effective use of communication and coordination technologies is increasingly crucial to success in the workplace, raising at the same time concerns about workplace privacy. In this paper, we present a case study showing how we adapted and used a participatory toolkit to elicit the privacy perspectives of a 3D print shop’s youth employees. Participants expected their managers and co-workers, rather than other third-parties, to see their data, and yet prioritized keeping their co-workers informed rather than being overly concerned about third-parties accessing their data. We found this approach effective at creating an expressive space for the youth to reflect on and share their expectations and preferences on workplace data privacy, a practice that can enhance both their workplace participation and professional communication training. We conclude with thoughts on how using open-ended participatory mechanisms can support employees’ ongoing reflection on the privacy of communication and coordination technologies, leading to increased fluency and participation in workplace decision-making.},

abstract = {As research and industry moves towards large-scale models capable of numerous downstream tasks, the complexity of understanding multi-modal datasets that give nuance to models rapidly increases. A clear and thorough understanding of a dataset’s origins, development, intent, ethical considerations and evolution becomes a necessary step for the responsible and informed deployment of models, especially those in people-facing contexts and high-risk domains. However, the burden of this understanding often falls on the intelligibility, conciseness, and comprehensiveness of the documentation. It requires consistency and comparability across the documentation of all datasets involved, and as such documentation must be treated as a user-centric product in and of itself. In this paper, we propose Data Cards for fostering transparent, purposeful and human-centered documentation of datasets within the practical contexts of industry and research. Data Cards are structured summaries of essential facts about various aspects of ML datasets needed by stakeholders across a dataset’s lifecycle for responsible AI development. These summaries provide explanations of processes and rationales that shape the data and consequently the models—such as upstream sources, data collection and annotation methods; training and evaluation methods, intended use; or decisions affecting model performance. We also present frameworks that ground Data Cards in real-world utility and human-centricity. Using two case studies, we report on desirable characteristics that support adoption across domains, organizational structures, and audience groups. Finally, we present lessons learned from deploying over 20 Data Cards.x},

abstract = {Sighted programmers often rely on visual cues (e.g., syntax coloring, keyword highlighting, code formatting) to perform common coding activities in text-based languages (e.g., Python). Unfortunately, blind and low-vision (BLV) programmers hardly benefit from these visual cues because they interact with computers via assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers), which fail to communicate visual semantics meaningfully. Prior work on making text-based programming languages and environments accessible mostly focused on code navigation and, to some extent, code debugging, but not much toward code editing, which is an essential coding activity. We present Grid-Coding to fill this gap. Grid-Coding renders source code in a structured 2D grid, where each row, column, and cell have consistent, meaningful semantics. Its design is grounded on prior work and refined by 28 BLV programmers through online participatory sessions for 2 months. We implemented the Grid-Coding prototype as a spreadsheet-like web application for Python and evaluated it with a study with 12 BLV programmers. This study revealed that, compared to a text editor (i.e., the go-to editor for BLV programmers), our prototype enabled BLV programmers to navigate source code quickly, find the context of a statement easily, detect syntax errors in existing code effectively, and write new code with fewer syntax errors. The study also revealed how BLV programmers adopted Grid-Coding and demonstrated novel interaction patterns conducive to increased programming productivity.},

The success of the VR products depends primarily on the product contextual relevance and qualities exhibited. However, it is unclear how VR practitioners curb software quality challenges and improve the essence of the VR product over every release. In this paper, we present a Systematic Mapping Study of the software quality metrics adopted by VR practitioners for assessing the quality of their VR products. The study showed that practitioners used unique metrics to measure the quality of their VR products in addition to adopting some of existing enterprise software metrics. Further, we consolidate these metrics into different themes that future practitioners may use for developing VR products.},

On the one hand, the advent of the Internet, particularly social media, has transformed the interaction between brands and their customers’ communities, pushing the fashion industry to embrace more sustainable models better reflecting their contemporary values, expectations, and behaviors. On the other hand, it explores how a new systemic approach to data analytics can empower the design process within the fashion industry to promote a radical sustainable transformation.},

However, autonomous driving abilities do not mean that vehicles should not interact with their drivers/passengers or their environment anymore. There are still many scenarios where either the automated system cannot handle the driving very well, or human wants to spontaneously influence the behavior of the system to meet their preferences. Thus, beyond the hype of autonomous driving, a large space opens for human-vehicle cooperation at a different level of automated driving. As this topic draws more attention both by academia and industry, we organize this workshop to in-depth identify potential research opportunities of it under the latest technology of automated driving. In this workshop, participants will discuss the motivations of driver/passenger’s intervention, generate the use cases of cooperative driving, and explore means of cooperation and interaction that human and vehicle would exchange intent smoothly. It is expected that the workshop will consolidate existing knowledge of human-vehicle-environment cooperation and provide insight for future works.},

We show that spiritual support is an integral dimension that underlies other social support types, and that if we ignore spirituality in design, we fail to mitigate problematic issues that arise in online spaces when users' spiritual values clash. Based on participants' ideations, we provide design implications for OHCs and other social media to better facilitate spiritual support through: (1) representing spiritual beliefs, (2) assistance with supportive communication, (3) support network visualization and mobilization, and (4) advance care planning and digital legacy.},

We performed a literature review to identify and synthesize key themes in how ethical theories have been applied to AMAs. We reviewed 53 papers and performed a thematic analysis to describe and synthesize the current conversation across HCI. We found many describe the value of ethical theories and implement them as technical contributions, but very few conduct empirical studies in real settings. Furthermore, we found AMA development is dominated by two ethical theories: deontology and consequentialism. We argue that the focus on deontology and consequentialism risks creating AMAs based on a narrow set of Western ethical values and concepts at the expense of other forms of moral reasoning.},

The basic provisions of public-private partnerships (PPP), the concept of risk sharing between the participants, taking into consideration social and economic effects. The main task is to analyze ways of identifying potential risks at an early stage of the project as a basis for building a risk management system consistent with generally accepted international and national practices, which in turn will provide high-quality risk management at all subsequent stages of project implementation, as well as scaling the effects on future PPP projects. The need to study this issue is determined by the high public interest in projects with state participation, especially in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the state order plays an important role in economic recovery. Any realized risks of PPP projects cause not only economic damage, but also undermine public confidence in the government, so the search for new or improved tools for risk management is the key task of any participant of PPP projects. Attention is focused on the simultaneous diversity and recurrence of risks arising during the implementation of projects, which indicates the need for centralized consideration of most risks in the proper organization of management processes. As a result of the study, it is proposed to consider the state as a single customer of infrastructure projects, regardless of their affiliation to different independent initiators, and to develop an information system for risk management in accordance with international best practices. This approach will provide PPP infrastructure projects with unified risk management tools and create a natural environment for rapid exchange of information and experience for more effective management of subsequent projects.},

abstract = {Civic problems are often too complex to solve through traditional top-down strategies. Various governments and civic initiatives have explored more community-driven strategies where citizens get involved with defining problems and innovating solutions. While certain people may feel more empowered, the public at large often does not have accessible, flexible, and meaningful ways to engage. Prior theoretical frameworks for public participation typically offer a one-size-fits-all model based on face-to-face engagement and fail to recognize the barriers faced by even the most engaged citizens. In this article, we explore a vision for open civic design where we integrate theoretical frameworks from public engagement, crowdsourcing, and design thinking to consider the role technology can play in lowering barriers to large-scale participation, scaffolding problem-solving activities, and providing flexible options that cater to individuals’ skills, availability, and interests. We describe our novel theoretical framework and analyze the key goals associated with this vision: (1) to promote inclusive and sustained participation in civics; (2) to facilitate effective management of large-scale participation; and (3) to provide a structured process for achieving effective solutions. We present case studies of existing civic design initiatives and discuss challenges, limitations, and future work related to operationalizing, implementing, and testing this framework.},

Despite several attempts at developing trust indicators to help readers more quickly and accurately assess the quality of content, challenges remain for practical deployment to general consumers. In this work we identify and address three key challenges: empirically determining which metrics from prior and existing community approaches most impact reader trust; 2) validating indicator placements and designs that are both compact yet noticed by readers; and 3) demonstrating that such indicators can not only lower trust but also increase perceived trust in the system when appropriate. By addressing these, we aim to provide a foundation for future tools that can practically increase trust in user generated content and the sociotechnical systems that generate and maintain them.},

abstract = {Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable speech-based communication, but generating speech is not the only resource needed to have a successful conversation. Being able to signal one wishes to take a turn by raising a hand or providing some other cue is critical in securing a turn to speak. Experienced conversation partners know how to recognize the nonverbal communication an augmented communicator (AC) displays, but these same nonverbal gestures can be hard to interpret by people who meet an AC for the first time. Prior work has identified motion-based AAC as a viable and underexplored modality for increasing ACs’ agency in conversation. We build on this prior work to dig deeper into a particular case study on motion-based AAC by co-designing a physical expressive object to support ACs during conversations. We found that our physical expressive object could support communication with unfamiliar partners. As such, we present our process and resulting lessons on the designed object itself and the co-design process.},

It represents a nuanced and challenging area of human-computer interaction that is well established and mature, offering the opportunity to observe designers’ work on highly demanding human-computer interfaces. This paper explores how and why digital luthiers choose their tools and how these tools relate to the challenges they face. Findings from 27 standardised open-ended interviews with prominent digital luthiers from commercial, research, independent and artistic backgrounds are analysed through reflexive thematic analysis. Our discussion explores their perspectives, finding that a process of pragmatic rationalisation and environmental influences play a significant role in tool selection. We also present how challenges faced by digital luthiers relate to social creativity and meta-design. These findings build upon the existing literature that examines the designer-tool relationship.},

abstract = {Much research in healthcare robotics explores extending rehabilitative interventions to the home. However, for adults, little guidance exists on how to translate human-delivered, clinic-based interventions into robot-delivered, home-based ones to support longitudinal interaction. This is particularly problematic for neurorehabilitation, where adults with cognitive impairments require unique styles of interaction to avoid frustration or overstimulation. In this paper, we address this gap by exploring the design of robot-delivered neurorehabilitation interventions for people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). Through a multi-year collaboration with clinical neuropsychologists and PwMCI, we developed robot prototypes which deliver cognitive training at home. We used these prototypes as design probes to understand how participants envision long-term deployment of the intervention, and how it can be contextualized to the lives of PwMCI. We report our findings and specify design patterns and considerations for translating neurorehabilitation interventions to robots. This work will serve as a basis for future endeavors to translate cognitive training and other clinical interventions onto a robot, support longitudinal engagement with home-deployed robots, and ultimately extend the accessibility of longitudinal health interventions for people with cognitive impairments.},

Digital Transformation affects both the city ecosystem and digitally transforms local government into a smart government (SG). European Commission launched its Digital (DCC) and Intelligent Cities Challenge (ICC) initiatives to provide cities with guidance and support to design and implement corresponding digital transformation strategies. This work-in-progress paper aims to present the updates from the strategic planning process for the city's digital transformation that was followed by a famous smart city – the city of Trikala in central Greece. Useful evidence is depicted about the different stakeholders’ perspectives and priorities within the city's digital transformation process. Moreover, findings show how local government is digitally transformed into a Smart Government via prioritizing data openness and community engagement.},

abstract = {Sexual assault survivors hesitate to disclose their stories to others and even avoid case-reporting because of psychological, social, and cultural reasons. Thus, conversational agents (CAs) have gained much attention as a potential counselor because CAs’ characteristics (e.g., anonymity) could mitigate various difficulties of human-human interaction (HHI). Despite the potentials, it is difficult to design a CA for survivors because various aspects should be considered. Especially, with traditional HCI approaches only (e.g., need-finding and usability tests), designers could easily miss psychological and subjective burdens that survivors feel toward a new system. Hence, while envisioning a burden-free CA for survivors, we agilely designed and implemented an initial prototype CA (NamuBot) with professionals (the police and counselors). We then conducted a qualitative user study to identify and compare burdens caused by the CA vs. humans. Lastly, we codesigned design features that could reduce the CA-bound burdens with 36 participants (19 survivors and 17 professionals). Notably, our findings showed that 17 survivors preferred reporting their case to NamuBot over humans, expressing far less burden. Although CAs could also place burdens on survivors, the burdens could be alleviated by the features that the survivors and professionals designed. Finally, we present design implications and strategies to develop burden-mitigating CAs for survivors.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes how the Socially Aware Design (SAwD) and Value-oriented and Culturally Approach (VCIA) design model can be used to develop an edutainment game for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The SAwD approach seeks a design that considers new dimensions in human-computer interaction, such as cultural, emotional, and social aspects of the user's everyday experience. From this perspective, the game was based on the VCIA model, which includes the stakeholders in the design process, through participatory methodologies, considering their behavioral patterns, culture, and values, once they influence how technology is understood and used, and the way it impacts people's lives. Serious games have been used as part of the treatment of ADHD in children to improve focus and attention, stimulate concentration, and be a tool for enhancing learning in areas such as math, combining education and entertainment (edutainment). In this sense, the main objective of the research was to identify the stakeholder's values and the impact of these values on game design. The first step was to conduct a literature review followed by interviews with stakeholders to raise and compare their values, as required by the VCIA model, so that a game prototype could be developed, followed by an iterative validation process with the target audience.},

We then augment these findings with data from interviews with 11 skilled researchers who reflect on their working experience in this area. Our analysis reveals how the domain has evolved from the European migrant crisis to a more global agenda of migration and points towards a shifting focus from addressing immediate needs to acknowledging more complex political and emotional aspects of mobility. We also uncover the critical role of academic, local, and international politics in migration research in HCI. We discuss these findings to explore future opportunities in this area and advance HCI research discourse with the marginalized populace.},

This approach, as an addition to the conventional analysis, provides additional insight into the data and facilitates the understanding of the simulated phenomenon. We deploy a coordinated multiple views configuration consisting of a parallel coordinates view, a 3D view, and three multi-view projections. The approach is illustrated using NVH simulation data for a four cylinder internal combustion engine.},

However, in our own work, we have also experienced their limitations, especially in situations where task models are partial ancillary models and not primary artifacts. This was one of the motivations for this paper, which presents a systematic examination of literature to better understand the current place of task models in the continual evolution of user-centred software development practices. While overview work in this domain typically focuses on the analysis of representative task modelling notations and/or tools and relies on foundation papers, we apply a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach to identify relevant themes and trends in the use of task models over the last twenty-years. The paper identifies and discusses dominant patterns of use as well as gaps. It provides a comprehensive framing of both past and present trends in task modelling and supports those who want to incorporate task modelling in their own work. From this we identify areas of research that should receive greater attention in order to address future considerations.},

Ability to visually evaluate the insertion can be helpful to achieve a proper physical fit of hearing aids or similar devices, but this is currently a challenging task. In this work we present CheckMyFit, a smartphone-based, automated solution enabling users to quickly take a photo of their hearing aid placement, and compare it with a reference ideal insertion. To evaluate the tool's usability and potential benefit we conducted two user studies: a) a pilot lab study with 7 participants, and b) a field study with 17 participants. In the two-week field study, older participants with no prior hearing aid experiences were instructed on hearing aid insertion remotely and performed daily insertions independently at home. We found that CheckMyFit is easy and quick to use for almost all participants. Ear-photo-aided insertions tend to have higher quality than insertions without the tool. This correlation was significant and persisted throughout the 2 weeks of the study, and is retained after a short break. This suggests that CheckMyFit tool can provide real-world benefit to new users learning to insert their hearing aids. We also used CheckMyFit to remotely facilitate the field study, demonstrating its potential usefulness in tele-medicine.},

With the application of CNN to solve more complex problems, their computing and storage requirements are also greatly increased. Traditionally, CNN is executed on CPU and GPU, but their low throughput and energy efficiency are the bottleneck of using them. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has many characteristics suitable for acceleration, it has become an ideal platform for hardware acceleration of CNN. We design and implement a convolutional neural network accelerator based on NVIDIA deep learning accelerator (NVDLA) on FPGA platform. We give the detailed structure of NVDLA, design the hardware system and software system. The neural networks that NVDLA can support are limited, but our architecture can realize the high bandwidth data communication between NVDLA and CPU. CPU handle the operations that NVDLA does not support. The accelerator will support more and more complex networks in the future.},

Examples of these data include forms of information that are commonplace in schools, such as student work and paper-based artifacts. One limitation in these situations is that there are less efficient ways to process such everyday varieties of information into analytics that are more usable and practical for educators. To explore how to address this constraint, we describe two sets of design experiments that utilize crowdsourced tasks for scoring open-ended assessments. Developing crowdsourced systems and their resulting analytics introduced a variety of challenges, such as attending to the expertise and learning of the crowd. In this paper, we describe the potential efficacy of design decisions such as screening the crowd, providing multimedia instruction, and asking the crowd to explain their answers. We also explore the potential of crowdsourcing as a learning opportunity for those participating in the collective tasks. Our work offers key design implications for leveraging crowdsourcing to process educational data in ways that are relevant to educators, while offering learning experiences for the crowd.},

abstract = {Inspired by previous research examining the challenges and benefits of Black Twitter (a community gathered on a platform used by Black people but not created by or for them), this design fiction presents a fictional study of a successful yet speculative social media platform named The Stoop. We envision this digital space as one that a Black woman created and a predominantly Black team designed and developed. Imagining what future online communities of marginalized people could be based on current struggles and shortcomings provides the inspiration for this design fiction. Proactively addressing content moderation, harassment, content controls, and the need for reducing appropriation while centering on the lived experiences and preferences of Black people allows this design fiction to joyfully speculate on what it can look like to get it right as a way of thinking through best practices for current technology design.},

abstract = {Smart weight scales offer bioimpedance-based body composition analysis as a supplement to pure body weight measurement. Companies such as Withings and Fitbit tout composition analysis as providing self-knowledge and the ability to make more informed decisions. However, these aspirational statements elide the reality that these numbers are a product of proprietary regression equations that require a binary sex/gender as their input. Our paper combines transgender studies-influenced personal narrative with an analysis of the scientific basis of bioimpedance technology used as part of the Withings smart scale. Attempting to include nonbinary people reveals that bioelectrical impedance analysis has always rested on physiologically shaky ground. White nonbinary people are merely the tip of the iceberg of those who may find that their smart scale is not so intelligent when it comes to their bodies. Using body composition analysis as an example, we explore how the problem of trans and nonbinary inclusion in personal health tech goes beyond the issues of adding a third "gender" box or slapping a rainbow flag on the packaging. We also provide recommendations as to how to approach creating more inclusive technologies even while still relying on exclusionary data.},

A Systematic Literature Mapping protocol was developed and executed in order to select the primary studies to perform the analysis and data extraction. 76 primary studies helped to answer the research questions. A large part of the contributions by the SVR community are virtual environments that support education in the health area. In addition, some gaps and research opportunities were identified: virtual environments that serve audiences with special needs; development frameworks that consider pedagogical aspects and the use of biometric measures to support the validation of improved learning outcomes.},

Due to their relative novelty, complexity, and opacity, these technologies provoke a variety of novel questions for design and governance. We interviewed researchers, developers, industry leaders, policymakers, and designers involved in their deployment to explore motivations, expectations, perceived opportunities and barriers to adoption. This provided insight into several pertinent challenges facing the adoption of these technologies, including: how they might make a nebulous concept like privacy computationally tractable; how to make them more usable by developers; and how they could be explained and made accountable to stakeholders and wider society. We conclude with implications for the development, deployment, and responsible governance of these privacy-preserving computation techniques.},

Consequentially, we launched into a remote participatory escape room narrative process with 10 learners reachable via mobile phones over a period of five months. Following a guided escape room narrative procedure we adapted activities progressively within an iterative approach of task completion, analysis, discussion and reflection. Student responses were analysed using Ekman’s emotion theory, to determine dominate emotions. We discuss how the prevalent emotions identified are to be guiding the final design of the narrative as well as the puzzles for an engaging mixed reality escape room experience. We further share our learning in accounting for technical as well as conceptual challenges in the remote interactions with the children considering the lack of resources as well as how the lock-down has affected the narrative design.},

abstract = {This paper examines the causes and consequences of legibility as an organizing principle in the design of digital agriculture (DA) systems in the United States. Legibility refers to systems of governance that use simplified understandings of a situation to control and direct action upon it. Legibility in digital agriculture systems occurs at the confluence of two traditions of legibility: the data-driven model common in the design of digital systems, and tactics for the control of nature and labor that have developed in the United States since the foundation of the colonies. Our argument draws from (1) a historical analysis of broader patterns of agricultural technology and racialized land dispossession in what is now the United States and (2) empirical fieldwork that examines the adoption and maintenance of digital agriculture systems in rural New York State. We describe the role that legibility historically has played in the development of agricultural systems in the US, and their consequences for who is able to farm and how. This history raises the questions: What is made legible to whom? In that process, what becomes illegible? While legibility promises transparent and environmentally beneficial control, in our fieldwork we find that the demands of legibility are also restructuring the physical landscape, creating additional invisible labor, producing systems that are brittle to real-world conditions on farms, and creating opaque systems that block people from adapting to their circumstances. In reading our fieldwork together with the historical case, we demonstrate the pressures that are shaping the stakes, subject, and objects of legibility in agricultural technology. As more data-driven systems are used for environmental contexts, the CSCW community needs to extend its ways to understand how data-driven systems impact land, labor, and resources.},

abstract = {Software developers are turning to vlogs (video blogs) to share what a day is like to walk in their shoes. Through these vlogs developers share a rich perspective of their technical work as well their personal lives. However, does the type of activities portrayed in vlogs differ from activities developers in the industry perform? Would developers at a software company prefer to show activities to different extents if they were asked to share about their day through vlogs? To answer these questions, we analyzed 130 vlogs by software developers on YouTube and conducted a survey with 335 software developers at a large software company. We found that although vlogs present traditional development activities such as coding and code peripheral activities (11%), they also prominently feature wellness and lifestyle related activities (47.3%) that have not been reflected in previous software engineering literature. We also found that developers at the software company were inclined to share more non-coding tasks (e.g., personal projects, time spent with family and friends, and health) when asked to create a mock-up vlog to promote diversity. These findings demonstrate a shift in our understanding of how software developers are spending their time and find valuable to share publicly. We discuss how vlogs provide a more complete perspective of software development work and serve as a valuable source of data for empirical research.},

abstract = {People are increasingly subject to the tracking of data about them at their workplaces. Sensor tracking is used by organizations to generate data on the movement and interaction of their employees to monitor and manage workers, and yet this data also poses significant risks to individual employees who may face harms from such data, and from data errors, to their job security or pay as a result of such analyses. Working with a large hospital, we developed a set of intervention strategies to enable what we call "collective sensemaking" describing worker contestation of sensor tracking data. We did this by participating in the sensor data science team, analyzing data on badges that employees wore over a two-week period, and then bringing the results back to the employees through a series of participatory workshops. We found three key aspects of collective sensemaking important for understanding data from the perspectives of stakeholders: 1) data shadows for tempering possibilities for design with the realities of data tracking; 2) data transducers for converting our assumptions about sensor tracking, and 3) data power for eliciting worker inclusivity and participation. We argue that researchers face what Dourish (2019) called the "legitimacy trap" when designing with large datasets and that research about work should commit to complementing data-driven studies with in-depth insights to make them useful for all stakeholders as a corrective to the underlying power imbalance that tracked workers face.},

In trying to learn from past research, we are missing much of the context—what happens after publication—despite it being necessary to fully understand a project’s results. From the 15 full papers at ACM DEV 2016, we consider 11 projects that developed digital technologies. Of those, we conducted interviews with authors of 6 of the projects. This novel approach to systematic analysis of the literature adds data unavailable via a traditional literature review. With this, we learn the full trajectories of these projects, including what came after publication, and aggregate learnings from author reflections. This forms what we call a project lifecycle review: we look at both the pre-publication and post-publication lifecycles of ICTD projects in order to understand their end-results and how they got there.},

Despite the fact that measuring muscle activity with electromyography (EMG) is technically well established, it is highly complex and its use in interfaces has been limited. Easy access to muscle sensing can offer new opportunities to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Off-the-shelf sensors often only provide low-level access, hence requiring expertise in signal processing and widening the gulf of execution for users without engineering skills. To address this challenge, we introduce EMBody, a data-centric toolkit for EMG-based interface prototyping and experimentation. EMBody offers multiple levels of prototyping fidelity for EMG sensing, signal processing, and data interpretation. Our data-centric toolkit encapsulates the different data representation stages, offering a wide range of customization opportunities to experts while also allowing non-technical designers to focus on creating new interaction techniques. EMBody features a lightweight form factor and wireless connectivity. Additionally, the system leverages an exploration-centered workflow by allowing rapid access to measurement data via the accompanying software. Users define a set of motions to be recognized and interactively provide example data points. The toolkit then handles signal processing and classification. The recognized movements are streamed on the local network, ready to be used by interactive applications. This paper reports on how to use EMBody and its implementation. We iteratively developed the toolkit in a series of workshops and example applications. Users who had none or very limited knowledge of EMG could rapidly create engaging functional prototypes, while experts appreciated the modularity of the software component allowing for a high degree of customization. We contribute the software and hardware components of EMBody as a tool for the research community to stimulate creative exploration of EMG systems.},

abstract = {As the role technology plays in relationships between people and their governments grows, developing a better understanding of how trust can inform designing civic technology with trust is urgent work for human computer-interaction researchers. This paper reports our efforts to design with trust through a two-year design-ethnography with the City of Atlanta Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs. We developed a sociotechnical system—Code Enforcer—to help this office guide immigrant residents through successfully engaging the city's code enforcement process. To inform the design process, we adapted our framework of trust-as-distance. While the framework was instrumental for integrating issues of trust throughout our design process, it also introduced tensions between how and by whom trust was enacted and interpreted. By reflecting on these tensions, we tease out the political and moral elements of designing with trust vital for HCI to navigate moving forward.},

abstract = {Algorithms have permeated throughout civil government and society, where they are being used to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. In this paper, we first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted for the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical interactions between human discretion, bureaucratic processes, and algorithmic decision-making by synthesizing disparate bodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA). We then applied the ADMAPS framework to conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth, eight-month ethnographic case study of algorithms in daily use within a child-welfare agency that serves approximately 900 families and 1300 children in the mid-western United States. Overall, we found that there is a need to focus on strength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks. In addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic processes and augment human discretion, rather than replace it. Finally, collective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes at both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we propose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making tools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector. We empirically validate the theoretically derived ADMAPS framework to demonstrate how it can be useful for systematically making pragmatic decisions about the design of algorithms for the public sector.},

We present SonicHoop, an augmented aerial hoop that generates auditory feedback via capacitive touch sensing, thus becoming a digital musical instrument that performers can play with their bodies. We compare three sonification strategies through a structured observation study with two professional aerial hoop performers. Results show that SonicHoop fundamentally changes their perception and choreographic processes: instead of translating music into movement, they search for bodily expressions that compose music. Different sound designs affect their movement differently, and auditory feedback, regardless of type of sound, improves movement quality. We discuss opportunities for using SonicHoop as an aerial hoop training tool, as a digital musical instrument, and as a creative object; as well as using interactive sonification in other acrobatic practices to explore full-body vertical interaction.},

Based on an analysis of these papers, our semi-systematic literature review demonstrates that assessment of learning regarding transfer of learning and controlled groups is rare, that the main role for learning theory is application, and that four main theoretical positions on learning can be recognized: constructivism, constructionism, cognitive theories, and socio-cognitive theory. The paper further presents an overview of how and which learning theories are used, and outlines paths for future CCI research based on the results.},

Mobile phone applications intended to address health and education challenges in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are prominent examples of these efforts. In this paper, I argue that design-especially, speculative approaches-can play a different role in HCI4D. Within HCI, speculative design has proven to be useful for raising critical questions. Here, I present a collection of nine speculative design concepts that are intended to raise questions about mobile phones; in particular, how they are designed and what they are used for. These concepts are inspired by my +10 years of studying mobile phone use in Kenya. In the discussion, I elaborate on how speculative design approaches can benefit HCI4D by prompting questions about whether the field is solving the right problems. I also discuss how speculative design is useful for drawing attention to other problems and topics of study.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

The training of these physical tasks performed in dyad has great potential to foster inclusiveness while having an impact on both social and motor skills. In this paper, we present the design of a tangible and virtual interactive system for the training of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in performing joint actions. The proposed system is composed of a virtual character projected onto a surface on which a tangible object is magnetized: both the user and the virtual character hold the object, thus simulating a joint action. We report and discuss preliminary results of a field training study, which shows the potential of the interactive system.},

Fairness, especially provider-side fairness, requires that we consider a broader array of system users and stakeholders, whose needs, interests and preferences may need to be modeled. In this paper, we describe a framework in which the interests of providers and other stakeholders are represented as agents. These agents participate in the production of recommendations through a two-stage social choice mechanism. This approach has the benefit of being able to represent a wide variety of fairness concepts and to extend to multiple fairness concerns.},

abstract = {Technical interventions in socio-technical systems are often portrayed overly positively but can also have undesirable consequences which can directly impact adoption and sustainability. Systematically identifying what might go wrong is not straightforward. This paper presents the iterative development, including an early validation trial, of an HCI-focused collaborative brainstorming approach to identify deviations from design intent that harm people. The established Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) guide word based method, not applied before in a HCI context beyond safety-critical systems despite extensive use in other disciplines, has been adapted and applied. Motivated by the need to enumerate impacts of technology on marginalised individuals and their communities, and utilising the lead author's previous experience, a more human-orientated ‘HCI HAZOP’ was investigated. Using two feasibility studies and two pilot studies, the adapted method has been trialled, evaluated and refined. The studies' findings demonstrate the usefulness of the method identifying undesirable consequences, even by novel practitioners without any prior training. The paper presents the adaption as a methodological contribution, an application of ‘HCI HAZOP’ through studies using scenario-based design artifacts identifying limitations and benefits, and guidance materials for use by other researchers.},

abstract = {Every day, we have to decide multiple times, whether and how much personal data we allow to be collected. This decision is not trivial, since there are many legitimate and important purposes for data collection, for examples, the analysis of mobility data to improve urban traffic and transportation. However, often the collected data can reveal sensitive information about individuals. Recently visited locations can, for example, reveal information about political or religious views or even about an individual's health. Privacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), can be employed to protect the privacy of individuals and, furthermore, provide mathematically sound guarantees on the maximum privacy risk. However, they can only support informed privacy decisions, if individuals understand the provided privacy guarantees. This article proposes a novel approach for communicating privacy guarantees to support individuals in their privacy decisions when sharing data. For this, we adopt risk communication formats from the medical domain in conjunction with a model for privacy guarantees of DP to create quantitative privacy risk notifications.  We conducted a crowd-sourced study with 343 participants to evaluate how well our notifications conveyed the privacy risk information and how confident participants were about their own understanding of the privacy risk.  Our findings suggest that these new notifications can communicate the objective information similarly well to currently used qualitative notifications, but left individuals less confident in their understanding. We also discovered that several of our notifications and the currently used qualitative notification disadvantage individuals with low numeracy: these individuals appear overconfident compared to their actual understanding of the associated privacy risks and are, therefore, less likely to seek the needed additional information before an informed decision.  The promising results allow for multiple directions in future research, for example, adding visual aids or tailoring privacy risk communication to characteristics of the individuals.},

They inform how individuals adopt particular products and services. This elusiveness of value creates a challenge for designers to gauge users’ value preferences, which are personal, contextual and abstract. We propose deliberation as a process to operationalise design for elicitation, reflection and value formation, using Live Action Role Play (LARP). The paper demonstrates how our deliberative LARP precipitates the otherwise ethereal data values to unfold in a social setting. We argue that engaging people in reflecting on and playing out their own value formation offers designers more powerful insights to address complex challenges of data-driven societies. We report on our findings that agency and negotiability are key to transcend the politics of preferences in data practices and thus enhance acceptability.},

abstract = {Urban growth continues to colonise and have devastating impacts on unceded lands and sites significant to Traditional Owners. In the wake of urban expansion, millennia of cultural traditions and culturally significant stories are often concealed or erased as concrete is poured or as lights turn on. The continuing emergence of massive media in the urban environment presents an additional risk for cultural erasure as places turn into screen spaces. We provide an argument for massive media and their content to closely connect with the lands they inhabit by giving voice to First Peoples narratives, and for First Peoples to lead in content creation. To this end, we discuss The Digital Birthing Tree, a bespoke content program for a large integrated media fa\c{c}ade on Wurundjeri Lands in present-day Australia. The analysis of our case results in six decolonising approaches that help practitioners engage with First Peoples-led content programs in culturally responsive ways. First Peoples leadership in massive media is urgent–not optional–enabling a unique opportunity to share millennia of traditions and knowledge, while responding critically to ongoing destruction and destabilisation of culture, lands and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Electronic health records in critical care medicine offer unprecedented opportunities for clinical reasoning and decision making. Paradoxically, these data-rich environments have also resulted in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that fit poorly into clinical contexts, and increase health workers cognitive load. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to designing CDSSs that are embedded in clinical workflows, by presenting problem-based curated data views tailored for problem-driven discovery, team communication, and situational awareness. We describe the design and evaluation of one such CDSS, In-Sight, that embodies our approach and addresses the clinical problem of monitoring critically ill pediatric patients. Our work is the result of a co-design process, further informed by empirical data collected through formal usability testing, focus groups, and a simulation study with domain experts. We discuss the potential and limitations of our approach, and share lessons learned in our iterative co-design process.},

abstract = {Communication technologies, from social media to video conferencing, are used by billions of people globally and contribute to shaping relationships between people. As these technologies become increasingly ubiquitous, the tech workers building them are increasingly making product decisions that can have far-reaching interpersonal ramifications. At the same time, few workplace tools and support exist to help tech workers understand and navigate these potential ramifications, and tech worker perspectives on such tools are not fully understood. In this work, we explore the needs, challenges, and opportunities encountered by tech workers in thinking through the interpersonal implications of their products. To do this, we ran a semi-structured interview study with 10 diverse tech workers. To ground the discussion, study participants interacted with a design probe prototype, InterAct, which provides research-grounded information about interpersonal implications of product features. Our findings suggest a desire by tech workers to consider the social implications of the technologies they build, and the potential for structured tooling to help provide the required knowledge and build organizational support. Based on these findings, we provide design considerations for creating future workplace tools to support thinking about the social implications of technologies.},

abstract = {The suggestion of Points of Interest (PoIs) to people with autism spectrum disorders challenges the research about recommender systems by introducing an explicit need to consider both user preferences and aversions in item evaluation. The reason is that autistic users' perception of places is influenced by sensory aversions, which can cause stress and anxiety when they visit the suggested PoIs. Therefore, the management of individual preferences is not enough to provide these people with suitable recommendations.To address this issue, we propose a Top-N recommendation model that combines information about the user's idiosyncratic aversions with her/his preferences in a personalized way. The goal is that of suggesting the places that (s)he can like and smoothly experience at the same time. We are interested in finding a user-specific balance of compatibility and interest within a recommendation model that integrates heterogeneous evaluation criteria to appropriately take these aspects into account.We tested our model on 148 adults, 20 of which were people with autism spectrum disorders. The evaluation results show that, on both groups, our model achieves superior accuracy and ranking results than the recommender systems based on item compatibility, on user preferences, or which integrate these aspects using a uniform evaluation model. These findings encourage us to use our model as a basis for the development of inclusive recommender systems.},

However, these gig economy systems are not typically designed in ways that centre workers’ preferences and wellbeing. In this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of ‘Freelance Grow,’ a design fiction portraying a freelancing platform that prioritises freelancers’ professional development and peer support. The design fiction was informed by a systematic literature assessment, using recommendations from twenty-six sources for improving online freelancers’ experiences. We then used the design fiction in focus groups with 23 online freelancers to investigate their views on the ideas suggested in our design fiction. Based upon a thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts, we present three opportunities and considerations for designing systems that further enable freelancers’ work autonomy, entrepreneurial development, and peer support. Ultimately, we contribute an expanded understanding of design approaches to support online freelancers in the gig economy.},

It then describes three pedagogical interventions of our own in which improvisational techniques were deployed as methods of teaching and learning. From this integrated study, we report specific pedagogical conditions (socio-material evaluations, multi-sensory practices, and making safe spaces for error) that can support improvisational learning, and three common challenges of HCI pedagogy relevance, assessment, and inclusion that improvisational methods can help to address.},

While other examinations of HCI venues have considered the relative popularity of research topics and themes, we examine the methods being adopted by OzCHI authors. This is the first paper for over a decade to examine the methodologies being used at an HCI venue. We present a description of the relative balance of qualitative and quantitative work at OzCHI, and a close examination of the relative prevalence of a range of research methods. We also examine the relationships between analytical approach and gender, geography and—relying on recent changes to OzCHI—paper length. We find that the qualitative-quantitative split is not gender neutral, and has impact on page length of a paper, but is not affected by geography. Drawing on these insights we provide advice and guidance for future OzCHI organisers, and a research agenda for better understanding HCI as a discipline.},

abstract = {In the domain of computing education for children, much work has been done to devise creative and engaging methods of teaching about programming. However, there are many other fundamental aspects of computing that have so far received relatively less attention. This work explores how the topics of number systems and data representation can be taught in a way that piques curiosity and captures learners’ imaginations. Specifically, we present the design of two interactive physical computing artefacts, which we collectively call DataMoves, that enable students, 12-14 years old, to explore number systems and data through embodied movement and dance. Our evaluation of DataMoves, used in tandem with other pedagogical methods, demonstrates that the form of embodied, exploration-based learning adopted has much potential for deepening students’ understandings of computing topics, as well as for shaping positive perceptions of topics that are traditionally considered boring and dull.},

While recent HCI research has investigated child-agent interactions in the context of speech-based interfaces with rare mention of sample populations' racial makeup, scant research has examined how racially minoritized groups, in particular Black youth, interact with such technologies. Subsequently, issues of race and racism continue to be largely neglected within the HCI community, contributing to technology that marginalizes Black people. Leveraging Black feminist epistemology as a critical framework, we engage Black students in the ideation process of conversational agents as speech-based interfaces, drawing attention to how race, gender, and class influence their design choices. Our findings reveal that Black students prefer custom-designed conversational agents that are modeled after Black women, possessing knowledge of Black culture and serving as life coaches to help them achieve their goals. We also confirm that the current design of speech-based interfaces perpetuates racism, reinforcing whiteness as the norm.},

We find that in India, data is not always reliable due to socio-economic factors, ML makers appear to follow double standards, and AI evokes unquestioning aspiration. We contend that localising model fairness alone can be window dressing in India, where the distance between models and oppressed communities is large. Instead, we re-imagine algorithmic fairness in India and provide a roadmap to re-contextualise data and models, empower oppressed communities, and enable Fair-ML ecosystems.},

Instead, the contributing factors of user well-being will be located in environing social, cultural, and political conditions far beyond the control of individual users alone. In doing so, we hope to reinvigorate the issue of digital well-being measurement as a nexus point of political concern, through which multiple disciplines can study experiences of digital ill as symptomatic of wider social inequalities and (capitalist) relations of power.},

For this purpose, we consider different engineering phases and evaluate conventional techniques regarding their applicability for AR development. In requirements engineering, we found the integration of AR experts and the associated collaboration between actors to be of key aspect in the development process. Additionally, requirements about the physical world must be considered, which in turn has a huge impact on UI design. The relevance of the physical environment is not yet sufficiently addressed in applicable techniques, which also applies to current implementation frameworks and tools, complicating the AR development process. When evaluating AR software iterations, we found interaction testing and test automation to have great potential, although they have not yet been sufficiently researched. Our paper contributes to AR research by revealing current core challenges within the AR development process and formulating explicit research questions that should be considered by future research.},

Counselling practices have long noted that culture influences how mental health is perceived and treated, yet the design of mental health technologies is limited with respect to how users’ backgrounds influence usability and adoption. To identify inclusive design opportunities, we interviewed 20 East Asian university students in Canada. We found that they struggle to engage with technologies for mental health due to cultural stigma which have led them to prefer apps that support self-help though still valuing social help. We present inclusive design opportunities for mental health technologies that sensitively consider these challenges, including supporting learning opportunities with peers through storytelling and skill-sharing to promote literacy, empowerment, and advocacy for their own health. We conclude by discussing how universities can promote mental wellbeing more inclusively.},

In this study, we presented mental health professionals with nine design concepts for personal informatics systems to support interpersonal and social rhythm therapy. These designs, derived from prior empirical findings about patients’ data practices, utilize social interfaces to support the social ecologies critical to relational recovery in bipolar disorder. Designs included features for sharing data in dynamic social support systems, custom variables, commenting, co-tracking, and data-driven action plans. Qualitative analysis of clinicians’ feedback yielded design recommendations for mental health informatics, such as supporting all cognitive states of the multiplicative patient and the interactions between these states and patient–clinician interfaces. Diversity in clinical practice also necessitates application flexibility and careful integration with existing workflows.},

This paper presents an ecologically-valid wizard-of-oz elicitation study exploring realistic user requirements for an ideal instructional video playback control while cooking. Through the analysis of the issued commands and performed actions during this non-linear and complex task, we identify (1) patterns of command formulation, (2) challenges for design, and (3) how task and voice-based commands are interwoven in real-life. We discuss implications for the design and research of voice interactions for navigating instructional videos while performing complex tasks.},

In this time, there has also been significant use of data visualization language in artefacts from online communities that provide commentary on the pandemic and create meaning through participatory digital culture. Using a qualitative approach, this paper examines over 300 memes collected from a public social media group targeted to young adults in the United States that uses the language of data visualization to discuss topics related to COVID-19. We outline four main ways that data visualization language is used in these memes-as a coarse indicator, as a visual analogy, as an opportunity for augmentation with emotion or interpretation, and as a visual pun-as well as two ways that memes leverage traditional and emerging approaches in the information visualization community. We describe the context in which these memes are socially created and interpreted in light of the political nature of online spaces and connect this work to ongoing research on participation, emotion, and embodiment in information visualization. These results aim to start a conversation about the use of data visualization language in digital culture and more casual networked environments beyond official channels.},

We describe our process, designed to create dialogic spaces that foster critical engagements with technologies and social issues, cooperation and peer-support. In our findings we explore how people defined and contextualised social impact in lived experiences, negotiated and legitimised their role as reviewers, and articulated the value of HCI research for social justice. We reflect on the significance of involving citizens in the commissioning of research that addresses inequalities and social justice in technology design and draw implications for HCI researchers concerned with ethical dimensions of technology. The work contributes to HCI and civic engagement's traditions to develop effective participatory methods and collaborative processes to produce digital technologies that support social justice.},

abstract = {Teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs) regularly present tactile materials (tactile graphics, 3D models, and real objects) to students with vision impairments. Researchers have been increasingly interested in designing tools to support the use of tactile materials, but we still lack an in-depth understanding of how tactile materials are created and used in practice today. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with 21 TVIs and a 3-week diary study with eight of them. We found that tactile materials were regularly used for academic as well as non-academic concepts like tactile literacy, motor ability, and spatial awareness. Real objects and 3D models served as “stepping stones” to tactile graphics and our participants preferred to teach with 3D models, despite finding them difficult to create, obtain, and modify. Use of certain materials also carried social implications; participants selected materials that fostered student independence and allow classroom inclusion. We contribute design considerations, encouraging future work on tactile materials to enable student and TVI co-creation, facilitate rapid prototyping, and promote movement and spatial awareness. To support future research in this area, our paper provides a fundamental understanding of current practices. We bridge these practices to established pedagogical approaches and highlight opportunities for growth regarding this important genre of educational materials.},

Additionally, they advocate for more inclusionary policies of Black women and other marginalized populations within the CSCW and HCI communities. We conclude with a call to action for both communities to: 1) stand in solidarity with Blacks in computing; and 2) acknowledge, disavow, and dismantle Whiteness and oppressive power structures in the field of computing, specifically HCI and CSCW.},

Unlike other administrative data, these narratives offer a more credible source of information with respect to workers’ interactions with families as well as underscore the role of systemic factors in decision-making. SIGCHI researchers have emphasized the need to understand human discretion at the street-level to be able to design human-centered algorithms for the public sector. In this study, we conducted computational text analysis of casenotes at a child-welfare agency in the midwestern United States and highlight patterns of invisible street-level discretionary work and latent power structures that have direct implications for algorithm design. Casenotes offer a unique lens for policymakers and CW leadership towards understanding the experiences of on-the-ground caseworkers. As a result of this study, we highlight how street-level discretionary work needs to be supported by sociotechnical systems developed through worker-centered design. This study offers the first computational inspection of casenotes and introduces them to the SIGCHI community as a critical data source for studying complex sociotechnical systems.},

As public sector agencies begin to adopt ADS, it is critical that we understand workers’ experiences with these systems in practice. In this paper, we present findings from a series of interviews and contextual inquiries at a child welfare agency, to understand how they currently make AI-assisted child maltreatment screening decisions. Overall, we observe how workers’ reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their knowledge of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures, (2) their beliefs about the ADS’s capabilities and limitations relative to their own, (3) organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the ADS, and (4) awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own decision-making objectives. Drawing upon these findings, we discuss design implications towards supporting more effective human-AI decision-making.},

However, limited research focuses on how values should be extensively considered in industrial deployments of recommender systems, the ignorance of which can be problematic. To fill this gap, in this paper, we adopt Value Sensitive Design to comprehensively explore how practitioners and users recognize different values of current industrial recommender systems. Based on conceptual and empirical investigations, we focus on five values: recommendation quality, privacy, transparency, fairness, and trustworthiness. We further conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 users and 10 practitioners to delve into their opinions about these values. Our results reveal the existence and sources of tensions between practitioners and users in terms of value interpretation, evaluation, and practice, which provide novel implications for designing more human-centric and value-sensitive recommender systems.},

We show that agreement is a mathematical tolerance relation generating a tolerance space over the set of elicited proposals. We review current measures of agreement and show that all can be computed from an agreement graph. In response to recent criticisms, we show that chance agreement represents an issue solely for inter-rater reliability studies and not for end-user elicitation, where it is opposed by chance disagreement. We conduct extensive simulations of 16 statistical tests for agreement rates, and report Type I errors and power. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for practitioners and introduce a five-level hierarchy for elicitation studies.},

A field theory is a working theory about salient interactions in a particular domain and sensitizing concepts in order to frame design investigations.&nbsp;It is presented visually in a field theory diagram to support succinct communication and critique. Studying use of design prototypes that have been informed by a field theory helps to reflect upon and refine the theory.&nbsp;In this paper we present examples from our HCI classes and reflections based on interviews with students.

By assuming visual abilities, earlier efforts to make physical computing accessible fail to address the need for BVI developers to access sensor data. PSST enables BVI developers to understand real-time, real-world sensor data by providing control over what should be displayed, as well as when to display and how to display sensor data. PSST supports filtering based on raw or calculated values, highlighting, and transformation of data. Output formats include tonal sonification, nonspeech audio files, speech, and SVGs for laser cutting. We validate PSST through a series of demonstrations and a user study with BVI developers.},

In addition, both primed gesture groups had higher memorability with 80% of the sci-fi-primed gestures and 73% of the creative mindset group gestures were recalled correctly after one week without practice compared to 43% of the control group gestures.},

In this study, we explore perceptions of review processes for algorithmic decisions that differ across three dimensions: the reviewer, how the review is conducted, and how long the review takes. Using a choice-based conjoint analysis we find that people prefer review processes that provide for human review, the ability to participate in the review process, and a timely outcome. Using a survey, we find that people also see human review that provides for participation to be the fairest review process. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the fairest review process provides the greatest likelihood of a favourable outcome, an opportunity for the decision subject and their situation to be fully and accurately understood, human involvement, and dignity. These findings have implications for the design of contestation procedures and also the design of algorithmic decision-making processes.},

To better envision conversational support-seeking systems for sexual violence survivors, we explore personalization trade-offs in designing such information systems. We implement a high-fidelity prototype dialogue-based information system through four design workshop sessions with three professional caregivers and interviewed with four self-identified survivors using our prototype. We then identify two forms of personalization trade-offs for conversational support-seeking systems: (1) specificity and sensitivity in understanding users and (2) relevancy and inclusiveness in providing information. To handle these trade-offs, we propose a reversed approach that starts from designing information and inclusive tailoring that considers unspecified needs, respectively.},

abstract = {Many journalists and newsrooms now incorporate audience contributions in their sourcing practices by leveraging user-generated content (UGC). However, their sourcing needs and practices as they seek information from UGCs are still not deeply understood by researchers or well-supported in tools. This paper first reports the results of a qualitative interview study with nine professional journalists about their UGC sourcing practices, detailing what journalists typically look for in UGCs and elaborating on two UGC sourcing approaches: deep reporting and wide reporting. These findings then inform a human-centered design approach to prototype a UGC sourcing tool for journalists, which enables journalists to interactively filter and rank UGCs based on users’ example content. We evaluate the prototype with nine professional journalists who source UGCs in their daily routines to understand how UGC sourcing practices are enabled and transformed, while also uncovering opportunities for future research and design to support journalistic sourcing practices and sensemaking processes.},

We explore engaging diffractively with ‘lived data’ to surface felt and prospective aspects of data as it is entangled in everyday lives of designers. This paper presents five biodata-based case studies demonstrating how design researchers can create knowledge about human bodies and behaviors via strategies that allow them to engage data diffractively. These studies suggest that designers can find insights for designing with data as it is lived by working with it in a slow, open-ended fashion that leaves room for messiness and time for discovering difference. Finally, we discuss the role of ambiguous, open-ended data interpretations to help surface different meanings and entanglements of data in everyday lives.},

Its aim is to (i) chart the state-of-the-art in this domain (e.g. methods used), (ii) identify the ways the HCI community has addressed the needs of children with ADHD (e.g. technologies deployed), and (iii) describe the involvement of the various stakeholders playing a role in their everyday experiences (i.e. their care ecosystem). Our findings show limited engagement of the care ecosystem in the design, development and user studies of current technologies, and shortcomings in designing for multiple ecosystem stakeholders, despite their crucial role. We also find that most HCI contributions are systems aiming to address ADHD-related symptoms. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for further research and design considerations for future systems that empower and promote the well-being of children with ADHD, while considering their care ecosystem.},

In this paper, we draw on two SHCI corpora to ask: Has SHCI progressed? How has the field responded to prominent critiques? Have we identified and adopted constructive strategies for impacting environmental unsustainability? We further show the wide array of competencies SHCI researchers have been called to develop, and how this has been reflected in subsequent work. Our analysis identifies significant shifts in the SHCI landscape, toward research that is diverse and holistic, but also away from efforts to address the urgent climate crisis. We posit that SHCI has tended to take on far more than it could reasonably expect to deliver, and propose ‘Green Policy informatics’ as a pathway that enables SHCI to leverage a more traditional HCI skillset in addressing climate change.},

The introduction of services might be carefully planned, but their closure may not benefit from the same degree of consideration. A more developed understanding of the effects of closures might make it possible to minimize negative consequences for users. This paper builds on sustainability, digital memories, and collaborative-work research through an empirical investigation of service closure. Fifty-five participants completed a questionnaire that solicited experiences of service closure and attitudes toward prospective closure. Through a qualitative analysis of participant responses, we synthesized six themes that reflected the practical and emotional effects of service closure on people: disempowerment, disconnection, loss of capability, trust, time and effort, and notice periods. We make suggestions for ways that service features related to these themes might be managed during closure, but also identify less tractable challenges: as part of this investigation, we introduce and develop the concept of service patinas to describe the important but entirely service-bound data that contextualize digital artefacts.},

abstract = {Previous gesture elicitation studies have found that user proposals are influenced by legacy bias which may inhibit users from proposing gestures that are most appropriate for an interaction. Increasing production during elicitation studies has shown promise moving users beyond legacy gestures. However, variety decreases as more symbols are produced. While several studies have used increased production since its introduction, little research has focused on understanding the effect on the proposed gesture quality, on why variety decreases, and on whether increased production should be limited. In this paper, we present a gesture elicitation study aimed at understanding the impact of increased production. We show that users refine the most promising gestures and that how long it takes to find promising gestures varies by participant. We also show that gestural refinements provide insight into the gestural features that matter for users to assign semantic meaning and discuss implications for training gesture classifiers.},

We conducted interviews with professional artists who were collaborating with software developers, learning software development, and building and maintaining software. We found artists were motivated to learn software development for intellectual growth and access to technical communities. Artists valued efficient workflows through skilled manual execution and personal software development, but avoided high-level forms of software automation. Artists identified conflicts between their priorities and those of professional developers and computational art communities, which influenced how they used computational aesthetics in their work. These findings contribute to efforts in systems engineering research to integrate end-user programming and creativity support across software and physical media, suggesting opportunities for artists as collaborators. Artists’ experiences writing software can guide technical implementations of domain-specific representations, and their experiences in interdisciplinary production can aid inclusive community building around computational tools.},

We conducted a thematic analysis of 2,217 user reviews sampled from 40 depression apps in Google Play and Apple App Store, totaling over 77,500 words. Users reported positive and negative experiences, with ethical implications evident in areas of benefits, adverse effects, access, usability and design, support, commercial models, autonomy, privacy, and transparency. We integrated our elements of ethically designed apps for depression and principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, autonomy, and virtue, and we conclude with implications for ethical design of apps for depression.},

abstract = {Robotic applications have entered various aspects of our lives, such as health care and educational services. In such Human-robot Interaction (HRI), trust and mutual adaption are established and maintained through a positive social relationship between a user and a robot. This social relationship relies on the perceived competence of a robot on the social-emotional dimension. However, because of technical limitations and user heterogeneity, current HRI is far from error-free, especially when a system leaves controlled lab environments and is applied to in-the-wild conditions. Errors in HRI may either degrade a user’s perception of a robot’s capability in achieving a task (defined as performance errors in this work) or degrade a user’s perception of a robot’s socio-affective competence (defined as social errors in this work). The impact of these errors and effective strategies to handle such an impact remains an open question. We focus on social errors in HRI in this work. In particular, we identify the major attributes of perceived socio-affective competence by reviewing human social interaction studies and HRI error studies. This motivates us to propose a taxonomy of social errors in HRI. We then discuss the impact of social errors situated in three representative HRI scenarios. This article provides foundations for a systematic analysis of the social-emotional dimension of HRI. The proposed taxonomy of social errors encourages the development of user-centered HRI systems, designed to offer positive and adaptive interaction experiences and improved interaction outcomes.},

abstract = {Governance in online communities is an increasingly high-stakes challenge, and yet many basic features of offline governance legacies-juries, political parties, term limits, and formal debates, to name a few-are not in the feature-sets of the software most community platforms use. Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the development of an open standard for networked governance.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of smart home devices (SHD) has increased privacy concerns among users, yet user-friendly controls are lacking. While there is a large body of research focused on understanding privacy concerns and threat models of SHD users, there is limited research so far aimed at informing the development of privacy controls in SHDs. This paper presents the results of 25 interviews focused on characterizing the users' needs for privacy controls. Through qualitative analysis of interview data, we present 7 design factors and 32 sub-factors for the design of privacy controls in SHDs. The interview findings inform the design of a survey that was deployed to 440 adult SHD users to gain quantitative insights on privacy control requirements and to complement the interview findings. Based on the findings, we discuss a privacy control framework that guides designers towards user-centric privacy controls.},

abstract = {Extreme classification (XC) is the essential component of large-scale Deep Learning Systems for a wide range of application domains, including image recognition, language modeling, and recommendation. As classification categories keep scaling in real-world applications, the classifier’s parameters could reach several thousands of Gigabytes, way exceed the on-chip memory capacity. With the advent of near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offloading the XC component onto NMP units could alleviate the memory-intensive problem. However, naive NMP design with limited area and power budget cannot afford the computational complexity of full classification. To tackle the problem, we first propose a novel screening method to reduce the computation and memory consumption by efficiently approximating the classification output and identifying a small portion of key candidates that require accurate results. Then, we design a new extreme-classification-tailored NMP architecture, namely ENMC, to support both screening and candidates-only classification. Overall, our approximate screening method achieves 7.3 \texttimes{} speedup over the CPU baseline, and ENMC further improves the performance by 7.4 \texttimes{} and demonstrates 2.7 \texttimes{} speedup compared with the state-of-the-art NMP baseline.},

Yet, creating experiences for spatial computing is non-trivial and needs skills in programming and 3D content creation, rendering them inaccessible to a wider group of users. We present SpatialProto, an in-situ spatial prototyping system for lowering the barrier to engage in spatial prototyping. With a depth-sensing capable mixed reality headset, SpatialProto lets users record animated objects of the real-world environment (e.g. paper, clay, people, or any other prop), extract only the relevant parts, and directly place and transform these recordings in their physical environment. We describe the design and implementation of SpatialProto, a user study evaluating the system’s prototype with non-expert users (n = 9), and demonstrate applications where multiple captures are fused for compelling augmented reality experiences.},

Players' coping strategies are limited to tools that focus on punishing toxic players (e.g., muting, blocking, reporting), which are inadequate and often misused. To address the needs of players experiencing toxicity, we took inspiration from research in other online spaces that provide support tools for targets of harassment. We iteratively designed and evaluated in-game tools to support targets of toxicity. While we found that most players prefer tools that explicitly address toxicity and increase feelings of control, we also found that tools that solely provide social or emotional support also decrease stress, increase feelings of control, and increase positive affect. Our findings suggest that players may benefit from variety in toxicity support tools that both explicitly address toxicity in the moment and help players cope after it has occurred.},

Difficulties with EF have marked impacts on adaptive living skills, learning outcomes, and quality of life for people with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities, as well as the broader population. While there is considerable research interest in EF training intervention for disabled populations, very few studies explore metacognitive intervention for people with cognitive disabilities. Metacognition comprises conscious beliefs and strategies around task management and goal setting. Metacognitive awareness has been shown to mediate the effects of executive function on self-regulated learning. Metacognitive interventions have also shown promise in general education, military training, and medical practice. We present a virtual reality experience deploying agent-based modeling to support explicit metacognitive strategy instruction for undergraduate students of all neurotypes. Our results support that explicit instructional material explaining executive function and metacognition in relation to problem-solving experiences influenced participant self-concept and awareness of personal traits and cognitive processes.},

To understand privacy risks, behaviors, and consequences from the perspective of workers, we analyzed workers’ posts about privacy and surveillance from 12 Reddit forums representing four main types of work (crowdwork, freelancing, ridesharing, and delivery). We found that workers perceive both platform companies and customers as sources of unnecessary and opaque data collection and surveillance that can threaten their privacy, safety, and economic outcomes. Workers also engage in many risk mitigation strategies, including self-protective surveillance behaviors such as video recording themselves and customers, as a costly but necessary response to power imbalances created by surveillance. Based on our multi-platform analysis, we present a guiding set of questions that workers, designers, and researchers can use to assess the privacy implications of current and future gig work platforms.},

abstract = {Dance provides unique opportunities for embodied interdisciplinary learning experiences that can be personally and culturally relevant. danceON is a system that supports learners to leverage their body movement as they engage in artistic practices across data science, computing, and dance. The technology includes a Domain Specific Language (DSL) with declarative syntax and reactive behavior, a media player with pose detection and classification, and a web-based IDE. danceON provides a low-floor allowing users to bind virtual shapes to body positions in under three lines of code, while also enabling complex, dynamic animations that users can design working with conditionals and past position data. We developed danceON to support distance learning and deployed it in two consecutive cohorts of a remote, two-week summer camp for young women of color. We present our findings from an analysis of the experience and the resulting computational performances. The work identifies implications for how design can support learners’ expression across culturally relevant themes and examines challenges from the lens of usability of the computing language and technology.},

Notational programming blurs contexts: certain typewritten variables can be referenced in handwritten notation and vice-versa. To illustrate this paradigm, we developed an extension, Notate, to computational notebooks which allows users to open drawing canvases within lines of code. As a case study, we explore quantum programming and designed a notation, Qaw, that extends quantum circuit notation with abstraction features, such as variable-sized wire bundles and recursion. Results from a usability study with novices suggest that users find our core interaction of implicit cross-context references intuitive, but suggests further improvements to debugging infrastructure, interface design, and recognition rates. Throughout, we discuss questions raised by the notational paradigm, including a shift from ‘recognition’ of notations to ‘reconfiguration’ of practices and values around programming, and from ‘sketching’ to writing and drawing, or what we call ‘notating.’},

Given accessibility research's increasing popularity and pervasive barriers to conducting and participating in research experienced by people with disabilities, it is critical to ask how methods are made accessible. Yet papers rarely describe their methods in detail. This paper reports on 17 interviews with accessibility experts about how they include both facilitators and participants with disabilities in popular user research methods. Our findings offer strategies for anticipating access needs while remaining flexible and responsive to unexpected access barriers. We emphasize the importance of considering accessibility at all stages of the research process, and contextualize access work in recent disability and accessibility literature. We explore how technology or processes could reflect a norm of accessibility. Finally, we discuss how various needs intersect and conflict and offer a practical structure for planning accessible research.},

While clinicians’ in-person observational gait assessments are important, research suggests that data from wearable sensors can indicate early onset of gait impairment, track patients’ responses to treatment, and support remote and longitudinal assessment. We present an inquiry into supporting the transition from research to clinical practice. Co-design by HCI, biomedical, neurology and rehabilitation researchers resulted in a data-rich interface prototype for augmented gait analysis based on visualized sensor data. We used this as a prompt in interviews with ten experienced clinicians from a range of MS rehabilitation roles. We find that clinicians value quantitative sensor data within a whole patient narrative, to help track specific rehabilitation goals, but identify a tension between grasping critical information quickly and more detailed understanding. Based on the findings we make design recommendations for data-rich remote rehabilitation interfaces.},

We focus on a 16-month, full-scale media architecture design project and zero in on seven of its component events, and use design-space schemas to shed light on the dynamics of the design space with respect to informing and filtering the design space. Our concluding contribution is to propose design-space thinking as a sub-discipline of design research. We argue that this research perspective serves to address the creative aspects of the design process, the generative potential of design-space thinking, and the tools that support design-space thinking and research.},

Through inductive and deductive analysis, we identified reasons for technology non-use and derived seven requirements that can inform the design and implementation of ballet assessment technologies including designing for: adaptation to multi-skill/multi-method environments, teacher/dancer skill augmentation, agency, non-invasive design, feedback for gross/fine movements, trust, and proprioception by supporting transformative assessment. We discuss barriers for technology acceptance and unintended consequences that should be considered when designing future technologies for ballet.},

However, unaccompanied migrant youth (UMY) still struggle in accessing appropriate mental health resources in spite of their high need for mental health support. Through co-design workshops, and using the lens of the social-ecological model of resilience, we explored the social-ecological factors that support or hinder UMY’s use of mental health apps as resources. We identified the strong influence of the macro-system (i.e. resettlement policies) on the bio-and micro-systems, which in turn limits participants’ abilities to use the apps. Our findings highlight the factors specific to each social-ecological system—including personal experiences, technological infrastructure and social environment—that need to be accounted for when designing technological mental health resources for UMY. This contributes: a rich description of the interplay of mental health apps with social-ecological systems in which UMY are embedded; and the corresponding design considerations.},

abstract = {Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer’s description of a community’s design—goal, rules, and member personas—and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models’ training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of online health communities (OHCs) published between 2009 and 2020 in the ACM Digital Library. Aiming to consolidate the current issues, design knowledge, challenges, and tensions in OHCs, our analysis identified four high-level aspects related to the use and design of OHCs: (1) temporal: OHCs as transition spaces, (2) spatial: bridging experiential knowledge with medical expertise, (3) technological: exchanging and locating peer support, and (4) tension dimensions in OHCs. We further discuss methodological improvements and computing opportunities for OHC research and how to increase OHC members’ agency in such a medically dominated context. These findings have the potential to inform future OHC designs and help researchers and designers position future contributions.},

abstract = {Technology research for neurodivergent conditions is largely shaped by research aims which privilege neuro-normative outcomes. As such, there is an epistemic imbalance in meaning making about these technologies. We conducted a critical literature review of technologies designed for people with ADHD, focusing on how ADHD is framed, the research aims and approaches, the role of people with ADHD within the research process, and the types of systems being developed within Computing and HCI. Our analysis and review is conducted explicitly from an insider perspective, bringing our perspectives as neurodivergent researchers to the topic of technologies in the context of ADHD. We found that 1) technologies are largely used to ‘mitigate’ the experiences of ADHD which are perceived as disruptive to neurotypical standards of behaviour; 2) little HCI research in the area invites this population to co-construct the technologies or to leverage neurodivergent experiences in the construction of research aims; and 3) participant resistance to deficit frames can be read within the researchers’ own accounts of participant actions. We discuss the implications of this status quo for disabled people and technology researchers alike, and close with a set of recommendations for future work in this area.},

abstract = {Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.},

abstract = {Visual slide-based presentations are ubiquitous, yet slide authoring tools are largely inaccessible to people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). When authoring presentations, the 9 BVI presenters in our formative study usually work with sighted collaborators to produce visual slides based on the text content they produce. While BVI presenters valued collaborators’ visual design skill, the collaborators often felt they could not fully review and provide feedback on the visual changes that were made. We present Diffscriber, a system that identifies and describes changes to a slide’s content, layout, and style for presentation authoring. Using our system, BVI presentation authors can efficiently review changes to their presentation by navigating either a summary of high-level changes or individual slide elements. To learn more about changes of interest, presenters can use a generated change hierarchy to navigate to lower-level change details and element styles. BVI presenters using Diffscriber were able to identify slide design changes and provide feedback more easily as compared to using only the slides alone. More broadly, Diffscriber illustrates how advances in detecting and describing visual differences can improve mixed-ability collaboration.},

abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced an unprecedented global shift within higher education in how instructors communicate with and educate students. This necessary paradigm shift has compelled educators to take a critical look at their teaching styles and use of technology. Computing education traditionally focuses on experiential, in-person activities. The pandemic has mandated that educators reconsider their use of student time and has catalysed overnight innovations in the educational setting.Even in the unlikely event that we return entirely to pre-pandemic norms, many new practices have emerged that offer valuable lessons to be carried forward into our post-COVID-19 teaching. This working group will explore what the post-COVID-19 academic landscape might look like, and how we can use lessons learned during this educational shift to improve our subsequent practice. Following a multinational study of computing faculty, this exploratory stage will identify practices within computing that appear to have been improved through exposure to online tools and technologies, and that should therefore continue to be used in the online space. In the broadest sense, our motivation is to explore what the post-COVID-19 educational landscape will look like for computing education.},

abstract = {With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.},

XAI is a core concern of Human-Centred AI and relies heavily on HCI techniques to explore how complex and difficult to understand AI models such as deep learning techniques can be made more understandable to people. However, XAI research has primarily focused on work-oriented and task-oriented explanations of AI and there has been little research on XAI for creative domains such as the Arts. This workshop will: i) build an XAIxArts research community; ii) map out the current and future possible landscapes of XAIxArts; iii) critically reflect on the potential of XAI for the Arts, forming the basis for an edited book on XAIxArts and an international network of researchers.},

Mirroring this trend is a concomitant interest in teaching young people about intelligent technologies. Whereas previous research in the field of Child–Computer Interaction has proposed curriculum and learning activities that describe what teenagers need to learn about AI/ML, there is still a shortage of studies which specifically address teenager-centered perspectives in the teaching of AI/ML. This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI also becomes essential in AR because end-users will frequently interact with intelligent services. However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses when, what, and how to provide explanations of AI output in AR. The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users’ preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. XAIR’s utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users. XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.},

However, charting this gap is challenging. In the context of XAI, we argue that charting the gap improves our problem understanding, which can reflexively provide actionable insights to improve explainability. Utilizing two case studies in distinct domains, we empirically derive a framework that facilitates systematic charting of the sociotechnical gap by connecting AI guidelines in the context of XAI and elucidating how to use them to address the gap. We apply the framework to a third case in a new domain, showcasing its affordances. Finally, we discuss conceptual implications of the framework, share practical considerations in its operationalization, and offer guidance on transferring it to new contexts. By making conceptual and practical contributions to understanding the sociotechnical gap in XAI, the framework expands the XAI design space.},

abstract = {eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models, and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique, and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback, with a two-fold outcome: first, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users’ trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so that we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.},

When fiduciary organizations interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests, and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment. Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data subject’s consent when interacting with complex technical systems.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) must increasingly be able to serve various global contexts. Overall, a fundamental need has been identified in the PD community to raise previously unheard global voices in design and development work, and to bring various underrepresented stakeholders together. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of various synchronous and asynchronous communication methods through collaborative online tools offers opportunities for more dispersed and more diverse PD research teams, settings and processes. This raises new possibilities for bridging global distances and bringing various stakeholders together for the purposes of conducting multicultural, multi-site PD. Importantly, while there exists extensive research literatures both on PD, on remote ethnography and on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, we posit that these literatures have not been brought together; nor have the practices and methodologies of these communities been sufficiently jointly explored to support the goals of multisite, multicultural PD. In this workshop, we strive to bridge this gap in knowledge through exploring the opportunities of conducting hybrid multi-site Participatory Design (HMPD) research through synchronous and asynchronous present–telepresent participatory methods, and to share issues, challenges, opportunities, methods and empirical examples pertaining to this as a goal.},

abstract = {With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainable work, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.},

This paper uses design fiction to consider what this tendency overlooks by examining settings where participants may exist in multiple power relationships simultaneously implicated by the research, specifically focusing on the contexts of misinformation, disinformation, and online hate (M/D/OH). Drawing from existing literature in M/D/OH, we present a series of imaginary method abstracts that prompt questions for researchers to reflect on as they adapt PD techniques for new, different contexts. We highlight three value tensions—authenticity, reciprocity, and impact—integral to sustaining a concern for responsibility in PD scholarship. We end with reflections and potential considerations for responsibly applying PD and design fiction methods in M/D/OH settings.},

We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.},

Because of this complexity, governing technology and data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability has proven to be a difficult task that –according to experts– requires a systems perspective in its design and implementation. In this paper, we take a conceptual approach to respond to this call from experts by providing working definitions of both enterprise data governance and a systems approach to management. Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential trade-offs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government. Simulation experiments suggest that an emphasis on governance of IT may create a strong foundation for the development of AI capability.},

abstract = {Machine intelligence relies on Al (artificial intelligence) trainers, workers who perform labor such as data annotation and algorithm optimization. However, the promise of Al does not often benefit workers equally; instead, it puts them in precarious situations, such as low wages and subordination to machines. My dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to draw attention to these pressing issues by exploring the sociotechnical, cultural, and economic dimensions of this emergent technology-mediated labor in the context of large data infrastructures. My arguments and proposed concepts (e.g., sociotechnical/algorithmic mobility) respond directly to the under-theorization of mobility research and ecologically unequal exchange theory in HCI. In my dissertation, I argue that the Al trainers, who often work in developing regions of western China, are shouldering the burdens of (1) alleviating China’s poverty through Al for development programs, (2) sustaining Eastern China’s platform economy as key participants in large-scale data infrastructure projects, and (3) promoting global Al advancement by providing disembodied labor on products such as high-quality training datasets through repetitive and low-paying work. Using multi-sited ethnography and participatory design methods, my dissertation describes the experiences of under-resourced and under-studied Al trainer communities and the effects of AI on them. It will also offer context-sensitive design recommendations for supporting emergent technology-mediated labor and policy interventions for ethical and sustainable Al training practices.},

Despite their success in research, healthcare, or education, LLMs frequently include incorrect information, called hallucinations, in their responses. These hallucinations could influence users to trust fake news or change their general beliefs. Therefore, we investigate mitigation strategies desired by users to enable identification of LLM hallucinations. To achieve this goal, we conduct a participatory design study where everyday users design interface features which are then assessed for their feasibility by machine learning (ML) experts. We find that many of the desired features are well-perceived by ML experts but are also considered as difficult to implement. Finally, we provide a list of desired features that should serve as a basis for mitigating the effect of LLM hallucinations on users.},

abstract = {Secondary school physical education (PE) teachers are continuously challenged to find ways to support students learning and motivate them for an active and healthy lifestyle. To address this complexity, continuing teacher professional development (TPD) is key. Technological tools can facilitate the effective delivery of TPD in this context. Successful implementation of this technology, however, is not self-evident. Based on the general aim of effectively integrating technologies in the educational process and focusing on the needs of educators, this study examines how the evidence-based theoretical TARGET framework for creating a motivating PE learning climate might be embedded into a digital professional development tool for PE teachers, useful in everyday practice. It presents a case study in which a multidisciplinary team of researchers, designers, and end-users iteratively went through several phases of need identification, idea generation, designing, development, and testing. By using a participatory approach, we were able to collect contextualized data and gain insights into users’ preferences, requirements, and ideas for designing and engaging with the tool. Based on these insights the TPD TARGET-tool for PE teachers was ultimately developed. The most prominent characteristics of this tool are (1) the combination of an evaluative function with teaching strategy support, (2) the strong emphasis on ease of use due to the complex PE teaching context, (3) the avoidance of social comparison, and suggestions of normative judgment, and (4) the allowance for a high level of customization and teacher autonomy.},

In this work, we reframe the role of machine learning as a provocation through a case study of participatory work co-creating exergames by employing machine learning and its training as a source of play and motivation rather than an accurate diagnostic tool for children with and without Sensory Based Motor Disorder. We created a design probe, Cirkus, that supports nearly any aminal locomotion exergame while collecting movement data for training a bespoke machine learning model. During 5 participatory workshops with a total of 30 children using Cirkus, we co-created a catalog of 17 exergames and a resulting machine-learning model. We discuss the potential implications of reframing machine learning’s role in Assistive Technology for values other than accuracy, share the challenges of using “messy” movement data from children with disabilities in an ever-changing co-creation context for training machine learning, and present broader implications of using machine learning in therapy games.},

abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated / human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically-generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically-generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

abstract = {Virtual humans (VHs) have the potential to support mental wellness among college computer science (CS) students. However, designing effective VHs for counseling purposes requires a clear understanding of students’ demographics, backgrounds, and expectations. To this end, we conducted two user studies with 216 CS students from a major university in North America. In the first study, we explored how students co-designed VHs to support mental wellness conversations and found that the VHs’ demographics, appearance, and voice closely resembled the characteristics of their designers. In the second study, we investigated how the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacted the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward gratitude journaling. Our findings suggest that the active participation of CS students in VH design leads to the creation of agents that closely resemble their designers. Moreover, we found that the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacts the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward mental wellness techniques.},

We propose FeedbackLogs, addenda to existing documentation of ML pipelines, to track the input of multiple stakeholders. Each log records important details about the feedback collection process, the feedback itself, and how the feedback is used to update the ML pipeline. In this paper, we introduce and formalise a process for collecting a FeedbackLog. We also provide concrete use cases where FeedbackLogs can be employed as evidence for algorithmic auditing and as a tool to record updates based on stakeholder feedback.},

In this study, we examine one significant life transition for young adults living with Type 1 Diabetes, the move from home to university, to understand how near future AI-enhanced technologies might provide opportunities and challenges for supporting care. From interviews with 24 students in the UK who had moved away from their childhood homes, we used sensemaking literature to frame the process of initial disruption to the rebuilding of self-care practices around a new lifestyle and support networks. By studying a significant life transition, we uncover implications for the design of T1D technology, particularly closed-loop systems, through AI enhancements and human-centred design approaches, then extrapolate for other significant life transitions and chronic conditions.},

We introduce JIZAI ARMS, a supernumerary robotic limb system consisting of a wearable base unit with six terminals and detachable robot arms controllable by the wearer. The system was designed to enable social interaction between multiple wearers, such as an exchange of arm(s), and explore possible interactions between digital cyborgs in a cyborg society. This paper describes the JIZAI ARMS’ design process, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human augmentation researchers, product designers, a system architect, and manufacturers, to realize a technically complex system while considering the aesthetics of a digital cyborg. We also provide an autobiographical report of our first impressions of using the JIZAI ARMS and use our findings to speculate on a model of potential social interactions between digital cyborgs.},

Unhoused persons are vulnerable and using their data in the ML pipeline raises serious concerns about the unintended harms and consequences of prioritizing different ML values. To address this, we conducted a critical analysis of 40 research papers identified through a systematic literature review in ML homelessness service provision research. We found that the values of novelty, performance, and identifying limitations were uplifted in these papers, whereas (in)efficiency, (low/high) cost, fast, (violated) privacy, and (homeless condition) reproducibility valuescollapse. Consequently, unhoused persons were lost (i.e., humans were deprioritized) at multi-level ML abstraction of predictors, categories, and algorithms. Our findings illuminate potential pathways forward at the intersection of data science, HCI and STS by situating humans at the center to support this vulnerable community.},

abstract = {Despite the growing consensus that stakeholders affected by AI systems should participate in their design, enormous variation and implicit disagreements exist among current approaches. For researchers and practitioners who are interested in taking a participatory approach to AI design and development, it remains challenging to assess the extent to which any participatory approach grants substantive agency to stakeholders. This article thus aims to ground what we dub the “participatory turn” in AI design by synthesizing existing theoretical literature on participation and through empirical investigation and critique of its current practices. Specifically, we derive a conceptual framework through synthesis of literature across technology design, political theory, and the social sciences that researchers and practitioners can leverage to evaluate approaches to participation in AI design. Additionally, we articulate empirical findings concerning the current state of participatory practice in AI design based on an analysis of recently published research and semi-structured interviews with 12 AI researchers and practitioners. We use these empirical findings to understand the current state of participatory practice and subsequently provide guidance to better align participatory goals and methods in a way that accounts for practical constraints.},

To work around this, ML teams will extrapolate proxy signals, or alternative signs from data to evaluate illness status and create training datasets. However, these signals' validity has not been determined, whether signals align with important contextual factors, and how proxy quality impacts downstream model integrity. We use ML and qualitative methods to evaluate whether a popular proxy signal, diagnostic self-disclosure, produces a conceptually sound ML model of mental illness. Our findings identify major conceptual errors only seen through a qualitative investigation -- training data built from diagnostic disclosures encodes a narrow vision of diagnosis experiences that propagates into paradoxes in the downstream ML model. This gap is obscured by strong performance of the ML classifier (F1 = 0.91). We discuss the implications of conceptual gaps in creating training data for human-centered models, and make suggestions for improving research methods.},

We investigate the role that Future Machine plays in engaging the human populations across these diverse places, exploring how the artists used strategies of entanglement and myth-making to support the interactions between the ecologies, technologies, non-human inhabitants, narratives and neighbourly relations that are emerging as the project evolves over time. In conclusion we propose that the artist strategies of entanglement and encouraging myth-making reveal new approaches to experiential design. We propose that these strategies provide opportunities to open up a set of disruptive/radical/novel design challenges for HCI, that encourage sustainable and positive forms of interactions for a world increasingly impacted by anthropogenic climate and environmental change},

Participants also reported challenges, from running code cells to managing information asymmetries and power imbalances. We discuss the potential of leveraging computational notebooks as interactive co-design tools to meet end user needs early in ML model lifecycles.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains comes with both high expectations of its benefits and dire predictions of misuse. While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

A future goal overarching the initial findings in this paper is to design technologically mediated, physical spaces (DivComp Spaces) within a school context where children meet, experiment and learn the complex dynamics of othering. We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children. Based on a thematic analysis, we present four themes — Technology as Utility and Authority, Individual and Collective Place-Making, Staged and Emerging Conflicts, Belonging to the Group and Self-Expression — which we use to inform three design directions for developing DivComp Spaces specifically in the context of school. Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly prevalent in our communities, aligning the values motivating their behavior with human values is critical. However, it is often difficult or impossible for humans, both expert and non-expert, to enumerate values comprehensively, accurately, and in forms that are readily usable for robot planning. Misspecification can lead to undesired, inefficient, or even dangerous behavior. In the value alignment problem, humans and robots work together to optimize human objectives, which are often represented as reward functions and which the robot can infer by observing human actions. In existing alignment approaches, no explicit feedback about this inference process is provided to the human. In this paper, we introduce an exploratory framework to address this problem, which we call Transparent Value Alignment (TVA). TVA suggests that techniques from explainable AI (XAI) be explicitly applied to provide humans with information about the robot's beliefs throughout learning, enabling efficient and effective human feedback.},

We explain our design process and discuss technological sensing errors in mixed reality devices, which emerged during the design sessions. We investigate the use of interactive machine learning techniques to mitigate such errors. Results from statistical analyses indicate that a deep learning model based on interactive machine learning can significantly reduce the number of technological errors in a set of musical performance tasks with the mixed reality musical instrument. Based on our findings, we argue that the application of interactive machine learning techniques can be beneficial for embodied, hand-controlled musical instruments in the mixed reality domain.},

It is uniquely difficult to introduce clinician-facing ML-based systems in practice, which has been recognised in HCI and related fields. Recent publications have begun to address the sociotechnical challenges of designing, developing, and successfully deploying clinician-facing ML-based systems. We conducted a qualitative systematic review and provided answers to the question: “How can HCI researchers and practitioners contribute to the successful realisation of ML in medical practice?” We reviewed 25 eligible papers that investigated the real-world clinical implications of concrete clinician-facing ML-based systems. The main contributions of this systematic review are: (1) an overview of the technical aspects of ML innovation and their consequences for HCI researchers and practitioners; (2) a description of the different roles that ML-based systems can take in clinical settings; (3) a conceptualisation of the main activities of medical ML innovation processes; (4) identification of five sociotechnical interdependencies that emerge from medical ML innovation; and (5) implications for HCI researchers and practitioners on how to mitigate the sociotechnical challenges of medical ML innovation.},

abstract = {In 2021, the National Institute of Justice — the research arm of the United States Department of Justice — released the “Recidivism Forecasting Challenge” (“the Challenge”) with the stated goals of “increas[ing] public safety and improv[ing] the fair administration of justice across the United States,” providing “critical information to community corrections departments...,” and ultimately “improv[ing]” the ability to forecast recidivism using person-and place-based variables” [68]. The Challenge was also designed, in part, to encourage “non-criminal justice forecasting researchers to compete against more ‘traditional’ criminal justice researchers” [68]. Challenge contestants had the opportunity to win part of the $723,000 in prize money for their submitted models. In this work, we highlight how the Challenge was underpinned by a techno-solutionist framing (emphasizing technical interventions without addressing underlying structural problems) [66] and plagued by serious ethical and methodological issues, including (1) the choice of training data and the selection of an outcome variable extracted from racially biased and inaccurate law enforcement data systems, (2) data leakage that may have seriously compromised the Challenge, (3) the choice of a faulty fairness metric, leading to the inability of submitted models to accurately surface any bias issues in the data selected for the Challenge, (4) the inclusion of candidate variables that created the potential for feedback loops, (5) a Challenge structure that arguably incentivized exploiting the metrics used to judge entrants, leading to the development of trivial solutions that could not realistically work in practice, and (6) the participation of Challenge contestants who demonstrated a lack of understanding of basic aspects of the U.S. criminal legal system’s structure and functions. We analyze the Challenge and its shortcomings through the lens of participatory design, applying emerging principles for robust participatory design practices in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) development to evaluate the Challenge’s structure and results. We argue that if the Challenge’s designers had adhered to these principles, the Challenge would have looked dramatically different or would not have occurred at all. We highlight several urgent needs and potential paths forward for any future efforts of this nature, recognizing the real and significant harms of recidivism prediction tools and the need to center communities directly impacted by policing and incarceration when thinking about whether to develop risk assessment tools.},

On the other hand, private companies are free to utilise these technologies. Many challenges and barriers must be overcome to have the public adopt these technologies. This one-day workshop will explore disruptive technologies from a local community perspective. We will use a case of artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled electronic ID (eID) for the initial framing and exploration of this problem and compare the differences when the software solution is deployed locally, nationally or internationally. These differences and issues can be looked at, for example, through the lens of trust, usability, security, and privacy.},

abstract = {The intersection of language and identity refers to the ways in which language use reflects and shapes one's sense of self and group membership. It is important to design voice-based technologies that represent and support diverse types of identities to increase accessibility. Due to constraints in the data and algorithms used to train and improve artificial intelligence (AI) systems like social robots or voice assistants, they are often unable to represent certain dialects of English and other languages. This could result in data bias, identity exclusion, and communication barriers that can impact the user's outcomes when using such dialects. Technology companies are discussing how to close this gap by improving training data; however, some researchers believe that the intersection of identity and technology calls for effective collaborative design methodologies that involve intended users. This work-in-progress paper presents preliminary findings on a participatory design method, comic-boarding, that can accomplish the above goal. Using comic-boarding, our intention is to create a space for critical reflection on language and identity in human-human and human-agent dialogue for children from marginalized communities.},

We used an ethical stakeholder analysis to inform a round of exploratory interviews, run with 8 participants including people with chronic primary pain, carers, and healthcare workers. We found that sound and technology serve as important but often unstructured tool, helping with distraction, mood regulation and sleep. The experience of pain and musical preferences are highly personal, and communicating or understanding pain can be challenging, even within family members. To address the gaps in current chronic pain self-management care, we propose the use a sound-based AI-driven system, a Digital Pain Companion, using sonification to create a shared decision-making space, enhancing agency over treatment in a co-operative care environment.},

abstract = {The emergence of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools poses a challenge to archives and records professionals, who are accustomed to understanding and documenting the activities of human agents rather than the often-opaque processes of sophisticated AI functioning. Preliminary work has proposed the term paradata to describe the unique documentation needs that emerge for archivists using AI tools to process records in their collections. For the purposes of archivists working with AI, paradata is conceptualized here as information recorded and preserved about records’ processing with AI tools; it is a category of data that is defined both by its relationship with other datasets and by the documentary purpose it serves. This article surveys relevant literature across three contexts to scope the relevant scholarship that archivists may draw upon to develop appropriate AI documentation practices. From the statistical social sciences and the visual heritage fields, the article discusses existing definitions of paradata and its ambiguous, often contextually dependent relationship with existing metadata categories. Approaching the problem from a sociotechnical perspective, literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) insists pointedly that explainability be attuned to specific users’ stated needs—needs that archivists may better articulate using the framework of paradata. Most importantly, the article situates AI as a challenge to accountability, transparency, and impartiality in archives by introducing an unfamiliar non-human agency, one that pushes the limits of existing archival practice and demands the development of new concepts and vocabularies to shape future technological and methodological developments in archives.},

abstract = {Responsible AI is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of AI. Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.},

abstract = {The potential of AI to improve people’s lives is unlimited. However, designing AI-infused systems to realize this potential for all is challenging, and it is particularly challenging within under-served minority communities. Revisiting algorithms and data sources to eliminate biases in AI is an important step toward expanding its benefits. However, this leads to the realization that some applications, although unbiased, may simply not be what marginalized communities need. Marginalized communities live in a unique socioeconomic and cultural context and have difficulties taking advantage of traditional AI-powered systems due to language, digital literacy, or other barriers. Additionally, the systems that currently exist usually fail to address the unique challenges in these communities. Therefore, designers and researchers in AI must understand that a fundamental dimension of fairness and ethics is to empower and lift the lives of under-served populations through purposeful human-AI research. This research not only recognizes the unique intersectionality and needs present in each community, but also treats them as the primary audience by overcoming traditional barriers between researchers and underserved communities. This SIG proposal aims to initiate a multidisciplinary discussion around the design of AI systems that are purposefully targeted to marginalized populations. Within this discussion, our objective is to better understand how to conduct research to support and serve these communities – particularly if we are not members of such communities; and challenge the effectiveness of techniques like user-centered design in the context of AI-infused systems when the designer is not a member of the user community. In addition, we will delve into ways of translating research into practical applications to create a positive impact within these communities and narrow the disparities that exist in the optimal utilization of AI to improve lives for different communities.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of AI in contemporary life has outpaced the public participation necessary for society to determine how these technologies should be used. As scholars respond to this challenge by exploring new modes of public participation in AI, we help advance these efforts by introducing influential work from public planning scholarship, the Ladder of Citizen Participation, as an analytical lens to help compare and contrast power in this work. We used the ladder to analyze participatory approaches to AI development in recent scholarship, finding that most of this work informs or consults rather than partners with or delegates control to participants. We also found that papers frequently reflect a writing style that makes it difficult to ascertain the degree of power afforded. We discuss implications from our work for powerholders (developers, researchers, practitioners) offering participatory approaches to AI and for people (specific communities, stakeholders, general public) participating in those processes.},

abstract = {Investigative journalists and public defenders conduct the essential work of examining, reporting, and arguing critical cases around police use-of-force and misconduct. In an ideal world, they would have access to well-organized records they can easily navigate and search. In reality, records can come as large, disorganized data dumps, increasing the burden on the already resource-constrained teams. In a cross-disciplinary research team of stakeholders and computer scientists, we worked closely with public defenders and investigative journalists in the United States to co-design an AI-augmented tool that addresses challenges in working with such data dumps. Our Document Organization Tool (DOT) is a Python library that has data cleaning, extraction, and organization features. Our collaborative design process gave us insights into the needs of under-resourced teams who work with large data dumps, such as how some domain experts became self-taught programmers to automate their tasks. To understand what type of programming paradigm could support our target users, we conducted a user study (n=18) comparing visual, programming-by-example, and traditional text-based programming tools. From our user study, we found that once users passed the initial learning stage, they could comfortably use all three paradigms. Our work offers insights for designers working with under-resourced teams who want to consolidate cutting-edge algorithms and AI techniques into unified, expressive tools. We argue user-centered tool design can contribute to the broader fight for accountability and transparency by supporting existing practitioners in their work in domains like criminal justice.},

However, the solutions have primarily focused on managing the negative emotions of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers go through a range of emotional experiences, which are often invisible to others. In this work, we aim to use the context of informal caregiving needs and experiences to understand how we can design future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for supporting emotion work. We conducted user studies and interviews to understand what informal caregivers perceive as emotion work in two caregiving contexts: parenting and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Based on the findings, we propose a framework for generating design requirements for AI systems that support emotion work. Our work contributes to how we can design AI to support people’s practices that involve emotion work.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of AI in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that AI systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in AI for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of AI for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive AI systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking AI ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in AI ethics more broadly.},

To address the lack of systematic understanding of how these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome, and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends and advocate for a human-centered approach.},

abstract = {This year's conference theme "HRI for all" not just raises the importance of reflecting on how to promote inclusion for every type of user but also calls for careful consideration of the different layers of people potentially impacted by such systems. In educational setups, for instance, the users to be considered first and foremost are the learners. However, teachers, school directors, therapists and parents also form a more secondary layer of users in this ecosystem. The 7th edition of R4L focuses on the issues that HRI experiments in educational environments may cause to stakeholders and how we could improve on bringing the stakeholders' point of view into the loop. This goal is expected to be achieved in a very practical and dynamic way by the means of: (i) lightening talks from the participants; (ii) two discussion panels with special guests: One with active researchers from academia and industry about their experience and point of view regarding the inclusion of stakeholders; another panel with teacher, school directors, and parents that are/were involved in HRI experiments and will share their viewpoint; (iii) semi-structured group discussions and hands-on activities with participants and panellists to evaluate and propose guidelines for good practices regarding how to promote the inclusion of stakeholders, especially teachers, in educational HRI activities. By acquiring the viewpoint from the experimenters and stakeholders and analysing them in the same workshop, we expect to identify current gaps, propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps, and capitalise on existing synergies with the collective intelligence of the two communities.},

By engaging 66 citizens in the critical assessment of futuristic designs of spaces, we reveal their needs and concerns about possible futures. Our findings show that citizens are concerned with the ecological limitations of urban technology, reliability, and data privacy. They also welcome the positive implications of adaptive environments and technological advancement. Participants were also reflective of how urban technology can change human experience, more generally. Our findings point to the need for flexibility, privacy, and adaptability to changing contexts, stimuli, and users in human-building interaction.},

abstract = {While anomaly detection stands among the most important and valuable problems across many scientific domains, anomaly detection research often focuses on AI methods that can lack the nuance and interpretability so critical to conducting scientific inquiry. We believe this exclusive focus on algorithms with a fixed framing ultimately blocks scientists from adopting even high-accuracy anomaly detection models in many scientific use cases. In this application paper we present the results of utilizing an alternative approach that situates the mathematical framing of machine learning based anomaly detection within a participatory design framework. In a collaboration with NASA scientists working with the PIXL instrument studying Martian planetary geochemistry as a part of the search for extra-terrestrial life; we report on over 18 months of in-context user research and co-design to define the key problems NASA scientists face when looking to detect and interpret spectral anomalies. We address these problems and develop a novel spectral anomaly detection toolkit for PIXL scientists that is highly accurate (93.4% test accuracy on detecting diffraction anomalies), while maintaining strong transparency to scientific interpretation. We also describe outcomes from a yearlong field deployment of the algorithm and associated interface, now used daily as a core component of the PIXL science team’s workflow, and directly situate the algorithm as a key contributor to discoveries around the potential habitability of Mars. Finally we introduce a new design framework which we developed through the course of this collaboration for co-creating anomaly detection algorithms: Iterative Semantic Heuristic Modeling of Anomalous Phenomena (ISHMAP), which provides a process for scientists and researchers to produce natively interpretable anomaly detection models. This work showcases an example of successfully bridging methodologies from AI and HCI within a scientific domain, and provides a resource in ISHMAP which may be used by other researchers and practitioners looking to partner with other scientific teams to achieve better science through more effective and interpretable anomaly detection tools.},

Through our case study using first-person design and a field study, we offer implications for critical, reflective, more-than-human and ludic design to engage AI technologies; the conceptualisation of an RtD research space which contributes to AI literacy discourses; and outline a research trajectory concerning materiality and design affordances of AI technologies.},

To do so, we conducted a task-based design study with 27 UXPs in which they prototyped and created a design presentation for a AI-enabled interface while having access to a simple AI model training tool. Through analyzing UXPs’ design presentations and post-activity interviews, we found that although UXPs struggled to clearly communicate some AI concepts, tinkering with AI broadened common ground when communicating with technical stakeholders. UXPs also identified key risks and benefits of AI in their designs, and proposed concrete next steps for both UX and AI work. We conclude with a sensitizing concept and recommendations for design and AI tools to enhance multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration when crafting human-centered AI experiences.},

In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of 17 design toolkits related to equity. We explore alternative design approaches that address inequity in design. We evaluate whether equity toolkits align with calls for changes to design practice, as well as Nancy Fraser’s dimensions of justice. Finally, we find that design toolkits focus on the ‘digital divide’ rather than redistributing world-building power, and thus continue to keep design power with professional designers. We also find that ‘design thinking’ continues to influence design toolkits. Furthermore, the simplicity of toolkits does not engage with the complexities that shape equity in practice. We conclude with suggestions to help researchers and designers rethink design toolkits.},

abstract = {Formal methods is a field that has a long standing history within Computer Science. At its core, it involves the use of mathematical formalisms to model and reason about computer systems and programs. The application of formal methods to verify that railway signalling systems operate safely and correctly is particularly well established within academia and is now beginning to see real applications in the railway sector. However, many contemporary approaches frequently detect false positive safety violations necessitating lengthy manual analysis by expert engineers. It has been shown that such errors can be mitigated with strengthening invariants, non-trivially generated properties which hold for all reachable states, or configurations, of a program under verification. In this work, we report on the use of machine learning to explore such state spaces autonomously and provide various visual aids to assist engineers in understanding and inducing invariant properties to support verification. We conducted a focus group with an engineering team specialising in railway signalling systems, soliciting feedback on these visualisations while co-designing suggested improvements for the application domain. The results were two-fold; our visualisations allowed participants to explore candidate invariants, but also highlighted improvements to our machine learning approach by leveraging their domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Ethical principles for algorithms are gaining importance as more and more stakeholders are affected by "high-risk" algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems. Understanding how these systems work enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and to assess the systems’ adherence to ethical values. Explanations are a promising way to create understanding, but current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research does not always consider existent theories on how understanding is formed and evaluated. In this work, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of understanding by conducting a qualitative task-based study with 30 participants, including users and affected stakeholders. We use three explanation modalities (textual, dialogue, and interactive) to explain a "high-risk" ADM system to participants and analyse their responses both inductively and deductively, using the "six facets of understanding" framework by Wiggins &amp; McTighe [63]. Our findings indicate that the "six facets" framework is a promising approach to analyse participants’ thought processes in understanding, providing categories for both rational and emotional understanding. We further introduce the "dialogue" modality as a valid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction with the "explainer", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the process. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding affects participants’ perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the interdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies have outlined. We posit that drawing from theories on learning and understanding like the "six facets" and leveraging explanation modalities can guide XAI research to better suit explanations to learning processes of individuals and consequently enable their assessment of ethical values of ADM systems.},

Between software development and operations, DevOps presupposes cross-functional cooperation and automation. The adoption and execution of DevOps in businesses are complicated since it necessitates adjustments to organizational, technical, and cultural factors. The implementation of DevOps in practice is thoroughly described in this systemic literature review (SLR). The study focuses on the identification of the manager's challenges in the DevOps environment and also intends to find the mitigation practices. In this article, SLR has been performed to identify the manager's challenges and the state-of-the-art mitigation strategies. This study identifies twenty challenges from the manager's perspective and the applied mitigation strategies to overcome the challenges. The findings of the current work would be beneficial in comprehending the DevOps idea, methods, and perceived impacts, particularly among managers while adopting DevOps in the organization.},

abstract = {Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems that rely on natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly prevalent within people's everyday lives. From virtual assistants integrated into mobile devices (e.g. Apple's Siri), smart home assistants (e.g. Google's Nest; Amazon's Alexa/Echo), and vehicles (e.g. Apple's CarPlay; Android Auto); to software tasks such as automatic translation, automatic captioning, automatic subtitling and even hands-free computing, ASR systems are core components of IoT (Internet of things) devices and applications. However, scholars have begun to show that with these increasing innovations and system capabilities, emerges fairness-related harms of user experiences and racial disparities that negatively impact African American speakers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). As users of ASR, AAVE speakers’ language is less accurately recognized and processed, leading to inequitable interactions among this ethnolect community. My graduate research seeks to address this challenge by developing and validating community-collaborative methods to innovate responsible approaches toward designing more representative and equitable ASR language technologies that accommodate African American speakers of AAVE.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making and big data systems are increasingly being used to provide innovative and essential services in the public sector. Such public services that utilize AI entail many related risks and responsibilities for citizens and public sector providers. Furthermore, the distinct regulatory demands and responsibilities of public sector services require crucial consideration of inclusiveness and civic empowerment. In this empirical study, we examine practitioners’ attitudes, practices and challenges of implementing inclusive AI services in the public sector that can empower greater civic agency. We conducted in-depth interviews with ten practitioners responsible for managing, developing or designing AI-enabled public services across three big public organizations in Finland in domains relating to the municipality, taxes, and social insurance. The results show that the discussion on inclusion and civic empowerment is just in its beginning in the public sector. Practitioners perceive the concept of inclusion as devising accessible public services for all members of society. Civic empowerment was understood as 1) institutional transparency, 2) civic participation in shaping the services, and 3) easing the use of the services for their users. The research suggests two distinct socio-cultural constructs emerging among practitioners that may influence (or hinder) how civic empowerment is manifested in such services: expert cultures and risk-averse cultures. The contributions of the study are twofold. First, we describe the practitioners’ perspectives on empowerment and inclusion in regard to public sector AI. Further, we recognize how expert and risk-averse cultures among practitioners explain their actions and restraints in devising public sector AI services.},

These powerful tools can answer complex questions and, surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this paper, we present a collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task---the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely.},

abstract = {In this paper we make the case for an expanded understanding of transparency. Within the now extensive FAccT literature, transparency has largely been understood in terms of explainability. While this approach has proven helpful in many contexts, it falls short of addressing some of the more fundamental issues in the development and application of machine learning, such as the epistemic limitations of predictions and the political nature of the selection of fairness criteria. In order to render machine learning systems more democratic, we argue, a broader understanding of transparency is needed. We therefore propose to view transparency as a communicative constellation that is a precondition for meaningful democratic deliberation. We discuss four perspective expansions implied by this approach and present a case study illustrating the interplay of heterogeneous actors involved in producing this constellation. Drawing from our conceptualization of transparency, we sketch implications for actor groups in different sectors of society.},

Therefore, as the first phases of this broader research, we present a new process, including a design toolkit, an open brief and a participatory structure. We discuss the resulting robot morphologies and participant feedback from a workshop in Japan, and conclude by discussing limitations and further research in designing robots with expressive movement, contextually sensitive within an HRI-for-all paradigm.},

And how does a meaningful explanation affect user’s trust perceptions? Our research investigates how the key factors affecting human-AI trust change in the light of human expertise, and how to design explanations specifically targeted at non-experts. By means of a stage-based design method, we map the ways laypeople understand AI explanations in a User Explanation Model. We also map both medical professionals and AI experts’ practice in an Expert Explanation Model. A Target Explanation Model is then proposed, which represents how experts’ practice and layperson’s understanding can be combined to design meaningful explanations. Design guidelines for meaningful AI explanations are proposed, and a prototype of AI system explanation for non-expert users in a breast cancer scenario is presented and assessed on how it affect users’ trust perceptions.},

abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion models and large language models have underpinned a new generation of powerful and accessible tools, and some of the most publicly visible applications are for artistic endeavour. Such tools, however, provide little scope for deeper understanding of AI systems, while the growing public interest in them can eclipse notice of the vibrant community of artists who have long worked with other forms of AI. We explore the potential for AI Art – particularly work in which AI is both tool and topic – to facilitate public AI literacies and consider how tactics developed before the current generative AI boom have continued relevance today. We look at the strategies of critical AI artists to scaffold public understanding of AI and enhance legibility for non-experts. This paper also investigates how collaborations between artists and AI researchers and designers can illuminate key technical and social issues relevant to the development of AI. The study entailed workshops between three professional artists who work with AI and a cross-disciplinary set of academic participants. This paper reports on these workshops and presents the intentions and strategies expressed by the artists, as well as insights of relevance to the research community on public AI literacies. We find that critical AI art can link underlying technical systems to structural issues of power and facilitate experiential learning that is situated and embodied, valuing interpretation over explanation. The findings also demonstrate the importance of transdisciplinary conversations around art, ethics and the political economy of AI technologies and how these dialogues may feed into AI design processes.},

abstract = {In recent years, discussions of responsible AI practices have seen growing support for ‘participatory AI’ approaches, intended to involve members of the public in the design and development of AI systems. Prior research has identified a lack of standardised methods or approaches for how to use participatory approaches in the AI development process. At present, there is a dearth of evidence on attitudes to and approaches for participation in the sites driving major AI developments: commercial AI labs. Through 12 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners and subject-matter experts, this paper explores how commercial AI labs understand participatory AI approaches and the obstacles they have faced implementing these practices in the development of AI systems and research. We find that while interviewees view participation as a normative project that helps achieve ‘societally beneficial’ AI systems, practitioners face numerous barriers to embedding participatory approaches in their companies: participation is expensive and resource intensive, it is ‘atomised’ within companies, there is concern about exploitation, there is no incentive to be transparent about its adoption, and it is complicated by a lack of clear context. These barriers result in a piecemeal approach to participation that confers no decision-making power to participants and has little ongoing impact for AI labs. This paper’s contribution is to provide novel empirical research on the implementation of public participation in commercial AI labs, and shed light on the current challenges of using participatory approaches in this context.},

Despite the long-standing and growing need for collaboration with CAD models and tools, anecdotal reports and ongoing researcher efforts point to a complex and unresolved set of challenges faced by designers when working with distributed CAD. We aim to close this academic-practitioner knowledge gap through the first systematic study of professional user-driven CAD collaboration challenges. In this work, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 CAD professionals of diverse industries, roles, and experience levels to understand their collaborative workflows with distributed CAD tools. In total, we identify 14 challenges related to collaborative design, communication, data management, and permissioning that are currently impeding effective collaboration in professional CAD teams. Our systematic classification of CAD collaboration challenges presents a guide for pressing areas of future work, highlighting important implications for CAD researchers, practitioners, and tool builders to target new advancement in CAD infrastructure, management choices, and modelling best practices. With the insights gained from this work, we hope to ultimately improve collaboration efficiency, quality, and innovation for future product design teams.},

abstract = {Recent advances in technology and reduction in hardware costs have made the collection of acoustic environmental recordings more accessible, thereby facilitating easier acquisition of biodiversity data for monitoring, research and conservation. Despite these advances, and the growing power of machine learning and automated techniques to process acoustic data, there exists a lack of tools to facilitate accessible visualisation and exploration of long-duration acoustic recordings collected in the field. Additionally, the exclusion of forest communities and traditional beliefs and practices in tropical forest conservation, originating from colonialism and continuing through neocolonial approaches, often results in tension between conservation practitioners, projects, and forest communities. While there has been a proliferation of citizen science projects, tools and applications arising from ecoacoustics research, there is a need to respond to calls, from other citizen science domains, for this work to engage with “citizens" outside the role of ‘data collector’, towards more co-creative citizen science. Through the lens of participatory design, my research attends to both issues by developing alternative methods of data visualisation that enable more accessible analysis and exploration of big ecoacoustics data, while attending to questions of conservation data justice and participation in forest fringe settings.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

abstract = {While there has been rapid growth in smart home research from a technical perspective– focusing on home automation, devices, software, and protocols– few review papers examine the human-centered perspective. A human-centered focus is crucial for achieving the goals of providing natural, convenient, comfortable, friendly, and safe user experiences in the smart home. To understand key innovations in human-centered smart home research, we analyzed keyword changes over time via 19,091 papers from 2000 to 2022, then selected 55 papers from high-impact venues in the last five years, and summarized them through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our analysis revealed five research trends with unique characteristics and interdependence. Drawing on this review, we elaborate on the future of smart home design research with respect to multidisciplinary development, stakeholder involvement, and the shift of design implications.},

abstract = {During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establishcommon ground ---a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs. Our study involved two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner that used a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study during which the autistic participants designed a game intended to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics. We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information. This project generated insights related to two distinct aspects of designing assistive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support autistic individuals: (1) the ability for visual elicitation activities to help autistic individuals recognize interaction patterns, gain a deeper understanding of other's perspectives, and imagine more desirable alternatives, and (2) the importance of recognizing and supporting multi-dimensional aspects of communication practices (i.e., social, emotional, sensory) in establishing and maintaining shared points of reference for neurodiverse conversation dyads.},

Drawing upon insights from Bagele, Cusicanqui, Wilson, Tuck and Yang, Driskill, Smith, and Bowker, I present arguments that challenge TPC and UX researchers to move beyond decolonial approaches lacking actionable implementation strategies. I also identify localization and translation practices as areas where indigenous epistemologies are often undermined. Against this backdrop, by employing indigenous-centered approaches, such as the integrative approach, third space, Afrikology and predominantly indigenous methodologies, TPC and UX researchers can address cultural nuances and design needs, ensuring respectful and effective communication. Furthermore, I propose the focused life-story interview method rooted in indigenous research paradigm as a means of exploring sensitive topics and fostering meaningful connections with participants. I conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to apply indigenous methodologies to ethically design artificial intelligence (AI) systems.},

abstract = {Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.},

abstract = {Administrative processes are ubiquitous in modern life and have been identified as a particular burden to those with accessibility needs. Students who have accessibility needs often have to understand guidance, fill in complex forms, and communicate with multiple parties to disclose disabilities and access appropriate support. Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) could allow us to reimagine such processes, yet there is currently limited understanding of how to design these to be accessible, or whether such an approach would be preferred. In the ADMINS (Assistants for the Disclosure and Management of Information about Needs and Support) project, we implemented a virtual assistant (VA) which is designed to enable students to disclose disabilities and to provide guidance and suggestions about appropriate support. ADMINS explores the potential of CUIs to reduce administrative burden and improve the experience of arranging support by replacing a static form with written or spoken dialogue. This article reports the results of two trials conducted during the project. A beta trial using an early version of the VA provided understanding of accessibility challenges and issues in user experience. The beta trial sample included 22 students who had already disclosed disabilities and 3 disability support advisors. After improvements to the design, a larger main trial was conducted with 134 students who disclosed their disabilities to the university using both the VA and the existing form-based process. The results show that the VA was preferred by most participants to completing the form (64.9% vs 23.9%). Qualitative and quantitative feedback from the trials also identified accessibility and user experience barriers for improving CUI design, and an understanding of benefits and preferences that can inform further development of accessible CUIs for this design space.},

The online robust preference elicitation procedure of [34] has been shown in simulation to outperform various other elicitation procedures in terms of effectively learning individuals’ true utilities. However, as with any simulation, the method makes a series of assumptions that cannot easily be verified to hold true beyond simulation. Thus, we propose to validate the robust method’s performance using real users, focusing on the particular challenge of selecting policies for prioritizing COVID-19 patients for scarce hospital resources during the pandemic. To this end, we develop an online platform for preference elicitation where users report their preferences between alternatives over a moderate number of pairwise comparisons chosen by a particular elicitation procedure. We recruit 193 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers to report their preferences and demonstrate that the robust method outperforms asking random queries by 21%, the next best performing method in the simulated results of&nbsp;[34], in terms of recommending policies with a higher utility.},

To address this disparity, we present our design fiction approach aimed at engaging citizens in speculating on HBI futures at a pop-up event. Through the pop-up format, visitors are initiated to the event’s subject matter through an exhibition and then invited to participate in a design fiction activity.

AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to support AAC users by improving the quality and variety of text suggestions. However, these technologies may fundamentally change how users interact with AAC devices as users transition from typing their own phrases to prompting and selecting AI-generated phrases. We conducted a study in which 12 AAC users tested live suggestions from a language model across three usage scenarios: extending short replies, answering biographical questions, and requesting assistance. Our study participants believed that AI-generated phrases could save time, physical and cognitive effort when communicating, but felt it was important that these phrases reflect their own communication style and preferences. This work identifies opportunities and challenges for future AI-enhanced AAC devices.},

abstract = {Can government govern artificial intelligence (AI)? One of the central questions of AI governance surrounds state capacity, namely whether government has the ability to accomplish its policy goals. We study this question by assessing how well the U.S. federal government has implemented three binding laws around AI governance: two executive orders—concerning trustworthy AI in the public sector (E.O. 13,960) and AI leadership (E.O. 13,859)—and the AI in Government Act. We conduct the first systematic empirical assessment of the implementation status of these three laws, which have each been described as central to US AI innovation. First, we track, through extensive research, line-level adoption of each mandated action. Based on publicly available information, we find that fewer than 40 percent of 45 legal requirements could be verified as having been implemented. Second, we research the specific implementation of transparency requirements at up to 220 federal agencies. We find that nearly half of agencies failed to publicly issue AI use case inventories—even when these agencies have demonstrable use cases of machine learning. Even when agencies have complied with these requirements, efforts are inconsistent. Our work highlights the weakness of U.S. state capacity to carry out AI governance mandates and we discuss implications for how to address bureaucratic capacity challenges.},

Drawing on two years of research across two public school districts in the United States, we study how families and school districts use students’ preferences for schools to meet their goals in the context of algorithmic student assignment systems. We find that the design of the preference language, i.e. the structure in which participants must express their needs and goals to the decision-maker, shapes the opportunities for meaningful participation. We define three properties of preference languages – expressiveness, cost, and collectivism – and discuss how these factors shape who is able to participate, and the extent to which they are able to effectively communicate their needs to the decision-maker. Reflecting on these findings, we offer implications and paths forward for researchers and practitioners who are considering applying a preference-based model for participation in algorithmic decision making.},

Specifically, we discuss the results of four focus groups where we used contestational artifacts to promote critical discussions and confront taken-for-granted beliefs among stakeholders. We reflect on the results to distill methodological insight and design recommendations for conducting adversarial participatory design research as a way towards confronting dominant narratives. Together with the methodological approach, the main contribution of this work, we also provide a set of narrative tensions that can be used to question common beliefs surrounding automated driving futures.},

abstract = {This paper combines design, machine learning and social computing to explore generative deep learning as both tool and probe for respiratory care. We first present GANspire, a deep learning tool that generates fine-grained breathing waveforms, which we crafted in collaboration with one respiratory physician, attending to joint materialities of human breathing data and deep generative models. We then relate a probe, produced with breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, and led with a group of ten respiratory care experts, responding to its material attributes. Qualitative annotations showed that respiratory care experts interpreted both realistic and ambiguous attributes of breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, according to subjective aspects of physiology, activity and emotion. Semi-structured interviews also revealed experts' broader perceptions, expectations and ethical concerns on AI technology, based on their clinical practice of respiratory care, and reflexive analysis of GANspire. These findings suggest design implications for technological aids in respiratory care, and show how ambiguity of deep generative models can be leveraged as a resource for qualitative inquiry, enabling socio-material research with generative deep learning. Our paper contributes to the CSCW community by broadening how generative deep learning may be approached not only as a tool to design human-computer interactions, but also as a probe to provoke open conversations with communities of practice about their current and speculative uses of AI technology.},

Despite the growing need to regulate ML systems, current processes for assessing and mitigating risks are disjointed and inconsistent. We interviewed 30 industry practitioners on their current social and ethical risk management practices and collected their first reactions on adapting safety engineering frameworks into their practice – namely, System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Our findings suggest STPA/FMEA can provide an appropriate structure for social and ethical risk assessment and mitigation processes. However, we also find nontrivial challenges in integrating such frameworks in the fast-paced culture of the ML industry. We call on the CHI community to strengthen existing frameworks and assess their efficacy, ensuring that ML systems are safer for all people.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

abstract = {Requirements elicitation is a crucial process in software engineering, which involves identifying and understanding the needs of stakeholders to define system requirements. Several techniques are used for requirements elicitation, each with unique advantages, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among 33 practitioners in the software development community to investigate their experiences with requirements elicitation techniques. The results revealed that practitioners find the elicitation process highly challenging due to difficulties managing the relationship between the development team and the client, understanding complex business processes, and the lack of knowledge among stakeholders. The survey also assessed the participants’ familiarity with various elicitation techniques. The most well-known techniques were brainstorming, data analysis, use cases, interviews, user stories, and prototyping. In contrast, techniques such as ethnography, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Joint Application Development (JAD), blueprint, and laddering were less recognized. When providing the pros and cons of some techniques, participants considered techniques’ clarity, speed of use, resource cost, and stakeholder involvement. This research contributes to the field by highlighting challenges, providing insights into practitioner experiences, and guiding informed decision-making in requirements elicitation.},

abstract = {This paper argues for the inclusion of tools that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) in information technology (IT) undergraduate courses that teach the fundamentals of software. LLM tools have become widely available and disrupt traditional methods for teaching software concepts. Learning objectives are compromised when students submit AI-generated code for a classroom assignment without comprehending or validating the code. Since LLM tools including OpenAI Codex, Copilot by GitHub, and ChatGPT are being used in industry for software development, students need to be familiar with their use without compromising student learning. Incorporating LLM tools into the curriculum prepares students for real-world software development. However, students still need to understand software fundamentals including how to write and debug code. There are many challenges associated with the inclusion of AI tools into the IT curriculum that need to be addressed and mitigated. This paper presents strategies and techniques to integrate student use of LLM tools, assist students’ interaction with the tools, and help prepare students for careers that increasingly use AI tools to design, develop, and maintain software.},

We designed and deployed a technology to support front-line staff at the largest emergency housing shelter in Calgary, Canada. Over a period of five months in 2022, we worked closely with front-line staff to co-design an interface for supporting a holistic understanding of client context and facilitating decision-making. The tool is currently in-use and our collaboration is ongoing. In this paper, we reflect on preliminary findings regarding the second iteration of the tool.

abstract = {Explanations of AI Agents' actions are considered to be an important factor in improving users' trust in the decisions made by autonomous AI systems. However, as these autonomous systems evolve from reactive, i.e., acting on user input, to proactive, i.e., acting without requiring user intervention, there is a need to explore how the explanation for the actions of these agents should evolve. In this work, we explore the design of explanations through participatory design methods for a proactive auto-response messaging agent that can reduce perceived obligations and social pressure to respond quickly to incoming messages by providing unavailability-related context. We recruited 14 participants who worked in pairs during collaborative design sessions where they reasoned about the agent's design and actions. We qualitatively analyzed the data collected through these sessions and found that participants' reasoning about agent actions led them to speculate heavily on its design. These speculations significantly influenced participants' desire for explanations and the controls they sought to inform the agents' behavior. Our findings indicate a need to transform users' speculations into accurate mental models of agent design. Further, since the agent acts as a mediator in human-human communication, it is also necessary to account for social norms in its explanation design. Finally, user expertise in understanding their habits and behaviors allows the agent to learn from the user their preferences when justifying its actions.},

To this end, we propose a novel AI agent with the goal of generating more human-like behavior. We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test, while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments. This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.},

abstract = {Incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives is seen as an essential step towards enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) ethics. In this regard, the field of arts is perceived to play a key role in elucidating diverse historical and cultural narratives, serving as a bridge across research communities. Most of the works that examine the interplay between the field of arts and AI ethics concern digital artworks, largely exploring the potential of computational tools in being able to surface biases in AI systems. In this paper, we investigate a complementary direction–that of uncovering the unique socio-cultural perspectives embedded in human-made art, which in turn, can be valuable in expanding the horizon of AI ethics. Through semi-structured interviews across sixteen artists, art scholars, and researchers of diverse Indian art forms like music, sculpture, painting, floor drawings, dance, etc., we explore how non-Western ethical abstractions, methods of learning, and participatory practices observed in Indian arts, one of the most ancient yet perpetual and influential art traditions, can shed light on aspects related to ethical AI systems. Through a case study concerning the Indian dance system (i.e. the ‘Natyashastra’), we analyze potential pathways towards enhancing ethics in AI systems. Insights from our study outline the need for (1) incorporating empathy in ethical AI algorithms, (2) integrating multimodal data formats for ethical AI system design and development, (3) viewing AI ethics as a dynamic, diverse, cumulative, and shared process rather than as a static, self-contained framework to facilitate adaptability without annihilation of values (4) consistent life-long learning to enhance AI accountability},

abstract = {With the growing need to regulate AI systems across a wide variety of application domains, a new set of occupations has emerged in the industry. The so-called responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners or AI ethicists are generally tasked with interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safe design of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives. In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes to business leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educators with a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent around the world, with the benefits related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability attractive in addition to the opportunity to establish entirely new capabilities. In order to operationalise autonomous systems technology it is critical to have in place the legal, regulatory and ethical infrastructure necessary to enable safe and trusted operation. While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems. The paper concludes by recommending next steps towards the regulation of safe and trusted autonomous systems, including a focus on collaboration and experimentation.},

In this paper, we report on the findings of a co-design process where older adults, physical therapy experts, and engineers designed robots to promote PA in older adults. We found a variety of motivators for and barriers against PA in older adults; we, then, conceptualized a broad spectrum of possible robotic support and found that robots can play various roles to help older adults engage in PA. This exploratory study elucidated several overarching themes and emphasized the need for personalization and adaptability. This work highlights key design features that researchers and engineers should consider when developing robots to engage older adults in PA, and underscores the importance of involving various stakeholders in the design and development of assistive robots.},

abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {Seamless human-computer interaction (HCI) was first proposed at the end of the last century. Since then, it has evolved, faced challenges, and recently experienced a revival across emerging HCI domains, driven by advancements in AI and 5G technologies. However, its concept has undergone significant changes. Within the context of user experience (UX) design, this term typically emphasizes the harmonious integration of various input, output modalities, and platforms to create a cohesive and consistent experience in interactive surface and spaces. In this workshop, we bring together academia and industry voices from around the globe, spanning mobile interaction, automotive human-machine interface (HMI), musical entertainment, mixed reality (MR) and wearables domains. We delve into the technology-driven transformation of seamless multimodal experience (SME), through addressing theoretical and methodological issues, exploring dimensions, guidelines, opportunities, as well as challenges for seamlessness innovation in HCI. Concurrently, we investigate approaches to harness these technologies to unlock the potential of multimodal user interfaces (MUIs) in seamless interactions. More broadly, we explore innovative SME concepts using a participatory design tool. Our collective goal is to achieve a shared understanding among participants and establish a framework of SME that will guide future human-computer interaction from physical to virtual spaces.},

Yet, these systems exclude several vulnerable patient groups and overlook telenurses’ competent interaction with their patients. This study, conducted in collaboration with telenurses, examines how AI can support their clinical assessment and was carried out in four phases: 1) interviews that revealed telenurses’ challenge of juggling decision-support and documentation interfaces, 2) a co-design workshop that conceptualized continuous nurse-AI interaction, 3) development of a prototype that suggested questions for nurses to ask callers, and 4) a role-play workshop that demonstrated nurse-AI interaction in practice. The study addresses how we can design for control in human-AI collaboration in order to enhance, rather than replace, human decision-making processes.},

These technologies are rapidly being integrated into children's everyday lives, but their functions and implications are rarely understood due to their complex and distributed nature. The review provides a rigorous overview of the state of the art based on 107 records published across the fields of human-computer interaction, learning sciences, computing education, and child–computer interaction between 2010 and 2020.&nbsp;The findings show the urgent need on a global scale for inter- and transdisciplinary research that can integrate these dispersed contributions into a more coherent field of research and practice. The article presents nine discussion points for developing a shared agenda to mature the field. Based on the HCI community's expertise in human-centred approaches to technology and aspects of learning, we argue that the community is ideally positioned to take a leading role in the realisation of this future research agenda.},

abstract = {AI is rapidly becoming enmeshed in our professional and private lives. The ubiquity of such technologies raises a host of ethical questions, value clashes, and unforeseen consequences that must be confronted. Developments such as Ai-Da and DALL-E 2 are exciting in that they present robust new capabilities in AI and creativity. However, the futures such technologies unlock are also unpredictable. Given the speed with which such technologies are emerging and becoming adopted, the need to engage target audiences to weigh in on possible AI futures is critical. Our pilot project, Artistic Process Futures and AI, seeks to explore the role and potential implications of AI technologies with artists. In this paper, we show how participatory speculative design processes might be channeled into a public statement, or manifesto, regarding possible and preferable AI futures for supporting the artistic process, and how our workshop exposed uncertainty at the core of such deliberation.},

Interactive applications of such agents, termed AI clones, pose risks related to impression management, identity abuse, and unhealthy dependencies. Identifying concerns AI clones will generate is a prerequisite to establishing the basis of discourse around how this technology will impact a source individual's selfhood and interpersonal relationships. We presented 20 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds with 8 speculative scenarios to explore their perception towards the concept of AI clones. We found that (1. doppelganger-phobia) the abusive potential of AI clones to exploit and displace the identity of an individual elicits negative emotional reactions; (2. identity fragmentation) creating replicas of a living individual threatens their cohesive self-perception and unique individuality; and (3. living memories) interacting with a clone of someone with whom the user has an existing relationship poses risks of misrepresenting the individual or developing over-attachment to the clone. These findings provide an avenue to discuss preliminary ethical implications, respect for identity and authenticity, and design recommendations for creating AI clones.},

We present our work toward developing the concept of gathering as a design process that invites physical prototyping as an important mechanism in developing culturally sustaining technologies. Gathering is inspired by “Hui,” an ‘undefinedlelo Hawai‘i Hawaiian language word translated as: to band together, assemble, organize. We share our ongoing journey of inventing and engaging in gathering and present four characteristics of gathering as a design process.

abstract = {Water supply and drainage systems, which are categorized as critical infrastructure, serve a crucial role in preserving societal health and well-being. Since climate change effects, harsher regulations, population changes, and aging infrastructure pose problems for these systems, the industry is experiencing a digital transition to meet these concerns. This article addresses Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and its application to water distribution networks, combining cyber, physical, and social components for adaptive, responsive, and intelligent management. This paper’s primary contributions include a review of recent security problems in the water industry, which emphasizes the necessity for stronger security measures. The article also examines how water distribution networks, as CPSS, fit into the interrelated realms of physical infrastructure, digital components, and stakeholder involvement, necessitating an all-encompassing system design and management strategy. In addition, the article investigates various cyber-physical attack scenarios, risk management methodologies, and the crucial role of integrated knowledge in mitigating these risks. In the context of increasing digitalization, the paper emphasizes the significance of taking into account both water infrastructure regulations under social space, such as the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD), and cyberspace-related legal and legislative standards, such as the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Cybersecurity Act. By tackling these difficulties and concentrating on privacy concerns, water utilities may contribute to the overall security and resiliency of vital infrastructure while assuring compliance with applicable legislation.},

We introduce a bespoke toolkit of technologies and showcase how we utilised the toolkit to engage communities of under-heard language speakers; and, through that engagement process, situate key aspects of ASR development in community contexts. The toolkit consists of (1) an information appliance to facilitate spoken-data collection on topics of community interest, (2) a mobile app to create crowdsourced transcripts of collected data, and (3) demonstrator systems to showcase ASR capabilities and to feed back research results to community members. Drawing on the sensibilities we cultivated through this research, we present a series of challenges to the orthodoxy of state-of-the-art approaches to ASR development.},

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

abstract = {As algorithms have become ubiquitous in consequential domains, societal concerns about the potential for discriminatory outcomes have prompted urgent calls to address algorithmic bias. In response, a rich literature across computer science, law, and ethics is rapidly proliferating to advance approaches to designing fair algorithms. Yet computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists are often not speaking the same language when using the term ‘bias.’ Debates concerning whether society can or should tackle the problem of algorithmic bias are hampered by conflations of various understandings of bias, ranging from neutral deviations from a standard to morally problematic instances of injustice due to prejudice, discrimination, and disparate treatment. This terminological confusion impedes efforts to address clear cases of discrimination. In this paper, we examine the promises and challenges of different approaches to disambiguating bias and designing for justice. While both approaches aid in understanding and addressing clear algorithmic harms, we argue that they also risk being leveraged in ways that ultimately deflect accountability from those building and deploying these systems. Applying this analysis to recent examples of generative AI, our argument highlights unseen dangers in current methods of evaluating algorithmic bias and points to ways to redirect approaches to addressing bias in generative AI at its early stages in ways that can more robustly meet the demands of justice.},

abstract = {Against a backdrop of algorithms that disempower, dehumanise, disenfranchise and discriminate, there are increasing calls to centre the human in AI development processes and to humanise AI development in practice; centring dignity in AI development could provide a way forward. Despite the inclusion of dignity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, like many other AI ethics principles, there is little operational understanding of what dignity can look like in practice when it comes to the development of algorithms. Drawing on cybernetics and a model of dignity developed in the field of international conflict resolution, this paper presents our work-in-progress tool - the Dignity Lens - for considering dignity throughout the AI development lifecycle, and practitioner reflections from using the tool. This work is an initial step towards articulating what dignity-centred AI development could look like in practice, assisting practitioners designing and developing algorithms to actively consider dignity.},

We present a social robot's box as interactive product packaging, designed to be reused as a "home'' for the robot. Through co-design sessions with children, an narrative-driven and socially engaging box was developed to support initial interactions between the child and the robot. Our findings emphasize the importance of packaging design to produce positive outcomes towards successful human-robot interaction.},

This complexity requires better addressing the situated and interrelated aspects of sensemaking practices and platforms, and how different disciplines and organisations collaborate during a crisis to turn ambiguity into resilience, and complexity into comprehension. We use design research and participatory design methodology to draw on learnings from the Finnish context and response to COVID-19 and other crises. These insights are then used to create design principles that bridge crisis informatics theory with HCI knowledge to create speculative, diegetic artefacts, which embody new practices and platforms that can be used to encourage collaborative sensemaking to tackle complex, large-scale crises and therefore have a positive impact on the resilience of the society.},

We investigated the approaches to annotator diversity through 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 44 AI/ML practitioners. While practitioners described nuanced understandings of annotator diversity, they rarely designed dataset production to account for diversity in the annotation process. The lack of action was explained through operational barriers: from the lack of visibility in the annotator hiring process, to the conceptual difficulty in incorporating worker diversity. We argue that such operational barriers and the widespread resistance to accommodating annotator diversity surface a prevailing logic in data practices—where neutrality, objectivity and ‘representationalist thinking’ dominate. By understanding this logic to be part of a regime of existence, we explore alternative ways of accounting for annotator subjectivity and diversity in data practices.},

abstract = {Emotion-aware services are increasingly used in different applications such as gaming, mental health tracking, video conferencing, and online tutoring. The core of such services is usually a machine learning model that automatically infers its user's emotions based on different biological indicators (e.g., physiological signals and facial expressions). However, such machine learning models often require a large number of emotion annotations or ground truth labels, which are typically collected as manual self-reports by conducting long-term user studies, commonly known as Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Responding to repetitive ESM probes for self-reports is time-consuming and fatigue-inducing. The burden of repetitive self-report collection leads to users responding arbitrarily or dropping out from the studies, compromising the model performance. To counter this issue, we, in this paper, propose a Human-AI Collaborative Emotion self-report collection framework, HACE, that reduces the self-report collection effort significantly. HACE encompasses an active learner, bootstrapped with a few emotion self-reports (as seed samples), and enables the learner to query for only not-so-confident instances to retrain the learner to predict the emotion self-reports more efficiently. We evaluated the framework in a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection scenario by performing a 3-week in-the-wild study (N = 32). The evaluation of HACE on this dataset (≈11,000 typing sessions corresponding to more than 200 hours of typing data) demonstrates that it requires 46% fewer self-reports than the baselines to train the emotion self-report detection model and yet outperforms the baselines with an average self-report detection F-score of 85%. These findings demonstrate the possibility of adopting such a human-AI collaborative approach to reduce emotion self-report collection efforts.},

Unfortunately, for the 1.8 million Americans with motor impairments who cannot eat without assistance, challenges restrict them from enjoying this pleasant social ritual. In this work, we identify the needs of participants with motor impairments during social dining and how robot-assisted feeding can address them. Using speculative videos that show robot behaviors within a social dining context, we interviewed participants to understand their preferences. Following a community-based participatory research method, we worked with a community researcher with motor impairments throughout this study. We contribute (a) insights into how a robot can help overcome challenges in social dining, (b) design principles for creating robot-assisted feeding systems, (c) and an implementation guide for future research in this area. Our key finding is that robots' unique assistive qualities can address challenges people with motor impairments face during social dining, promoting empowerment and belonging.},

Two of proposed future studies will pivot into evaluating and refining creator moderation design with different platform stakeholders. First, I will explore how audiences and creators recognize creator moderation's compatibility with platform ecosystem (e.g., monetization, recommendation algorithms). Second, I will organize participatory design workshops with stakeholders such as creators, commercial moderators, and audiences to redesign creator moderation to balance different stakeholders’ stakes and platform's top-down moderation efforts. My dissertation aims to contribute to HCI and CSCW fields through the notion of creator moderation and comprehensive design and policy solutions for a safe and sustaining platform ecosystem.},

To investigate this problem, prior work by Zhang &amp; Wobbrock (2023) developed multimodal interaction techniques in a prototype system called A11yBoard, but their system was limited to a single artboard in a self-contained prototype and was unable to support real-world use. In this work, we present a major extension of A11yBoard that expands upon its initial interaction techniques, addresses numerous real-world issues, and makes it deployable with Google Slides. We describe the new features developed for A11yBoard for Google Slides along with our participatory design process with a blind co-author. We also present two case studies based on real-world deployments showing that participants were able to independently complete slide reading and authoring tasks that were not possible without sighted assistance previously. We conclude with several design guidelines for making accessible digital content creation tools.},

The emerging capabilities of intelligent learning systems highlight and exacerbate existing challenges with meaningful human control of, and accountability for, the actions and effects of such systems. The related challenge of human ‘answerability’ for system actions and harms has come into focus in recent literature on responsibility gaps [2, 3]. We describe a proposed interdisciplinary approach to designing for answerability in autonomous systems, grounded in an instrumentalist framework of ‘responsible agency cultivation’ drawn from moral philosophy and cognitive sciences as well as empirical results from structured interviews and focus groups in the application domains of health, finance and government. We outline a prototype dialogue agent informed by these emerging results and designed to help bridge the structural gaps in organisations that typically impede the human agents responsible for an autonomous sociotechnical system from answering to vulnerable patients of responsibility.},

abstract = {Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists’ expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.},

Our method focuses on efficiently establishing successful task-oriented communication in an open multi-agent system, where the agents do not know anything about each other and can only communicate via grounded interaction. The method aims to assist researchers that work on human-machine interaction or scenarios that require a human-in-the-loop, by defining interaction restrictions and efficiency metrics. To that end, we point out the challenges and limitations of such a (diverse) setup, while also restrictions and requirements which aim to ensure that high task performance truthfully reflects the extent to which the agents correctly understand each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate a use-case where our method can be applied for the task of cooperative query answering. We design the experiments by modifying an established ontology alignment benchmark. In this example, the agents want to query each other, while representing different databases, defined in their own ontologies that contain different and incomplete knowledge. Grounded interaction here has the form of examples that consists of common instances, for which the agents are expected to have similar knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate successful communication establishment under the required restrictions, and compare different agent policies that aim to solve the task in an efficient manner.},

Since its inception over a decade ago, feminist HCI has progressed from the margins to mainstream HCI, with numerous references in the literature. Feminist HCI has also evolved to incorporate other critical HCI practices such as Queer HCI, participatory design, and speculative design. While feminist approaches have grown in popularity and become mainstream, it is getting more difficult to distinguish the feminist emancipatory core from other attempts of developing and improving society in various ways. In this workshop, we therefore want to revisit our feminist roots, where theory is a liberatory and creative practice, motivated by affect, curiosity, and wonder. From this standpoint, we consider which of our feminist tools can make a significant difference today, in a highly datafied world. The goal of this workshop is to; 1) create an inventory of feminist theories and concepts that have had an impact on our work as designers, educators, researchers, and activists; 2) develop a feminist toolbox for the CSCW community to strengthen our feminist literacy.},

abstract = {A well-designed and evaluated study plays an essential role in highlighting the impact and contribution of a research idea. However, novice Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers often lack the experience and know-how to devise an effective study. This workshop aims to provide a platform for those doing research in HRI, and related fields to obtain expert feedback on their study design before running a user study. The workshop invites a 2-4 page long contribution from participants outlining an upcoming user study focusing on the methods section and planned analyses. Participants will take part in two separate mentoring sessions led by different mentors. The workshop is interactive in nature and will also include mentor-led discussion sessions on topics relevant to study design such as hypothesis design and analysis, and human-centered study design.},

abstract = {How to protect people from algorithmic harms? A promising solution, although in its infancy, is algorithmic impact assessment (AIA). AIAs are iterative processes used to investigate the possible short and long terms societal impacts of AI systems before their use, but with ongoing monitoring and periodic revisiting even after their implementation. When conducted in a participatory and transparent fashion, they could create bridges across the legal, social and computer science domains, promoting the accountability of the entity performing them as well as public scrutiny. They could enable to re-attach the societal and regulatory context to the mathematical definition of fairness, thus expanding the formalistic approach thereto. Whilst the regulatory framework in the European Union currently lacks the obligation to perform such AIA, some other provisions are expected to play a role in AI development, leading the way towards more widespread adoption of AIA. These include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the risk assessment process under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Conformity Assessment (CA) foreseen under the AI Regulation proposal.In this paper, after briefly introducing the plurality of definitions of fairness in the legal, social and computer science domains, and explaining to which extent the current and upcoming legal framework mandates the adoption of fairness metrics, we will illustrate how AIA could create bridges between all these disciplines, allowing us to build fairer AI solutions. We will then recognise the role of DPIA, DSA risk assessment and CA by discussing the contributions they can offer towards AIA but also identify the aspects lacking therein. We will then identify how these assessment provisions could aid the overall technical discussion of introducing and assessing fairness in AI-based models and processes.},

abstract = {The AI Ethics community faces an imperative to empower stakeholders and impacted community members so that they can scrutinize and influence the design, development, and use of AI systems in high-stakes domains. While a growing chorus of recent papers has kindled interest in so-called “participatory ML” methods, precisely what form participation ought to take and how to operationalize these ambitions are seldom addressed. Our survey of the relevant literature shows that in many papers, participation is reduced to highly structured, computational mechanisms designed to elicit mathematically tractable approximations of narrowly-defined moral values. Of papers that actually engage with real people, these engagements typically consist of one-time interactions with individuals that are often unrepresentative of the relevant stakeholders. Motivated by these clear limitations, we introduce a consolidated set of axes to evaluate and improve participatory approaches. We use these axes to analyze contemporary work in this space and outline future AI research directions that could meaningfully contribute to operationalizing the ideal of participation.},

Yet, it is often underused due to a lack of visualization skills and time needed to sketch and detail. Current visual co-creation tools can support this with existing images, whereas generative AI can produce entirely new images from textual prompts, allowing for highly specific, personalized results. In this paper, we explore how AI image generation can be used to enhance inspiration and communication throughout collaborative design. We introduce BrainFax, a tool that facilitates generating, editing, and sharing images with AI through a chat bot and online whiteboard. Through co-creation with designers in the field, we found that AI image generation can boost designerly co-creation, yet needs careful embedding into a workflow to leverage inspirational and communicative creations. We close with a critical perspective on the implications of this technology for design and discuss limitations and future work.},

abstract = {Technology companies continue to invest in efforts to incorporate responsibility in their Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, while efforts to audit and regulate AI systems expand. This shift towards Responsible AI (RAI) in the tech industry necessitates new practices and adaptations to roles—undertaken by a variety of practitioners in more or less formal positions, many of whom focus on the user-centered aspects of AI. To better understand practices at the intersection of user experience (UX) and RAI, we conducted an interview study with industrial UX practitioners and RAI subject matter experts, both of whom are actively involved in addressing RAI concerns throughout the early design and development of new AI-based prototypes, demos, and products, at a large technology company. Many of the specific practices and their associated challenges have yet to be surfaced in the literature, and distilling them offers a critical view into how practitioners’ roles are adapting to meet present-day RAI challenges. We present and discuss three emerging practices in which RAI is being enacted and reified in UX practitioners’ everyday work. We conclude by arguing that the emerging practices, goals, and types of expertise that surfaced in our study point to an evolution in praxis, with associated challenges that suggest important areas for further research in HCI.},

This doctoral work addresses this problem by investigating how complex accessibility needs can be met by content personalisation by leveraging data-driven methods. To this end, I will collaborate with people with aphasia, a complex language impairment, as an exemplar community of people with complex accessibility needs. To better understand the needs of people with aphasia, I will use collaborative design techniques to meet the needs of end users. This will involve them in the design, development and evaluation of systems that demonstrate the benefits of content personalisation as an accessibility intervention.

abstract = {With the most advanced natural language processing and artificial intelligence approaches, effective summarization of long and multi-topic documents—such as academic papers—for readers from different domains still remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce ConceptEVA, a mixed-initiative approach to generate, evaluate, and customize summaries for long and multi-topic documents. ConceptEVA incorporates a custom multi-task longformer encoder decoder to summarize longer documents. Interactive visualizations of document concepts as a network reflecting both semantic relatedness and co-occurrence help users focus on concepts of interest. The user can select these concepts and automatically update the summary to emphasize them. We present two iterations of ConceptEVA evaluated through an expert review and a within-subjects study. We find that participants’ satisfaction with customized summaries through ConceptEVA is higher than their own manually-generated summary, while incorporating critique into the summaries proved challenging. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing summarization systems incorporating mixed-initiative interactions.},

This paper summarises the findings of the 2023 Bertinoro Seminar on Uncertainty in Self- Adaptive Systems, which aimed at thoroughly investigating the notion of uncertainty, and outlining open challenges associated with its handling in self-adaptive systems. The seminar discussions were centered around five core topics: (1) agile end-toend handling of uncertainties in goal-oriented self-adaptive systems, (2) managing uncertainty risks for self-adaptive systems, (3) uncertainty propagation and interaction, (4) uncertainty in self-adaptive machine learning systems, and (5) human empowerment under uncertainty. Building on the insights from these discussions, we propose a research agenda listing key open challenges, and a possible way forward for addressing them in the coming years.},

But in the actual busy lives of users, ambient notifications might be forgotten or even missed, nullifying the original notification. Could a system use multiple levels of noticeability to ensure its message is received, and how could this concept be effectively portrayed? To examine these questions, we took a Research through Design approach and created plant-mimicking Shape-Changing Interface (S-CI) artifacts, then conducted interviews with 10 participants who currently used a reminder system for health-related activities. We report findings on acceptable scenarios to disrupting people for health-related activities, and participants’ reactions to our design choices, including how using naturalistic aesthetics led to interpretations of the uncanny and morose, and which ways system physicality affected imagined uses. We offer design suggestions in health-related notification systems and S-CIs, and discuss future work in ambient-to-disruptive technology.},

But what exactly should platforms share with users about recommendation algorithms that would be meaningful to them? Research has looked into frameworks for explainability of algorithms as well as design features across social media platforms that can contribute to their transparency and accountability. We build on these prior efforts to explore what a recommendation algorithm transparency report may include and how it should present information to users. Through a human-centered co-design research process we result in: (1) A set of guidelines for recommendation algorithm transparency reports; (2) initial suggestions, in the form of prototypes, for more engaging and interactive forms of transparency; (3) an evaluation of these prototypes’ strengths and weaknesses, and areas of exploration for future work.},

abstract = {In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.},

abstract = {Youth regularly use technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is increasingly well-known that AI can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.},

The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations “in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This article addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to (i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; (ii) multimodal data and interfaces; (iii) the design process; (iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and (v) sustainability of the deployment.},

abstract = {AI curricula are being developed and tested in classrooms, but wider adoption is premised by teacher professional development and buy-in. When engaging in professional development, curricula are treated as set in stone, static and educators are prepared to offer the curriculum as written instead of empowered to be leaders in efforts to spread and sustain AI education. This limits the degree to which teachers tailor new curricula to student needs and interests, ultimately distancing students from new and potentially relevant content. This paper describes an AI Educator Make-a-Thon, a two-day gathering of 34 educators from across the United States that centered co-design of AI literacy materials as the culminating experience of a year-long professional development program called Everyday AI (EdAI) in which educators studied and practiced implementing an innovative curriculum for Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) in their classrooms. Inspired by the energizing and empowering experiences of Hack-a-Thons, the Make-a-Thon was designed to increase the depth and longevity of the educators' investment in AI education by positively impacting their sense of belonging to the AI community, AI content knowledge, and their self confidence as AI curriculum designers. In this paper we describe the Make-a-Thon design, findings, and recommendations for future educator-centered Make-a-Thons.},

abstract = {With the development of quantum computing, the existing cryptography schemes based on classical cryptographic primitives will no longer be secure. Hence, cryptographers are designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes, and ideal lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. Today, as ideal lattice-based cryptography becomes more mature, its performance becomes an important optimization goal. In ideal lattice-based cryptography, polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling are the most time-consuming operations and therefore need to be accelerated. In this article, taking advantage of the parallelism of new 512-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX512), we present parallel implementations of polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling, thus comprehensively improving their performance. We conduct experiments with the Dilithium scheme(one scheme of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-4). Our implementation gets a nice performance boost compared to its pure C language and 256-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX2) implementation.},

We analyze the designs through lenses of Environment, Data Privacy, Embodiment, and Play. This trip into the future is driven by the research question: how might generative AI tools change how we produce creativity and culture? When we return to the present, we ask ourselves, how might generative AI support positive outcomes for individuals and communities? Can we predict (and potentially mitigate) negative consequences of generative AI tools? The speculative designs purposefully engage viewers in futures thinking to reclaim conversation around the future of technology.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, ubiquitous sensors and systems have been an integral part of humans’ everyday life. They augment human capabilities and provide personalized experiences across diverse contexts such as healthcare, education, and transportation. However, the widespread adoption of ubiquitous computing has also brought forth concerns regarding fairness and equitable treatment. As these systems can make automated decisions that impact individuals, it is essential to ensure that they do not perpetuate biases or discriminate against specific groups. While fairness in ubiquitous computing has been an acknowledged concern since the 1990s, it remains understudied within the field. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that incorporates fairness considerations into system design, including prioritizing stakeholder perspectives, inclusive data collection, fairness-aware algorithms, appropriate evaluation criteria, enhancing human engagement while addressing privacy concerns, and interactive improvement and regular monitoring. Our framework aims to guide the development of fair and unbiased ubiquitous computing systems, ensuring equal treatment and positive societal impact.},

abstract = {Developing resilient autonomous systems requires an interdisciplinary approach that can understand performance variability and respond to critical events when they occur. Resilience within autonomous systems must also account for social norms as well as broader ethical and legal considerations. Within this paper we outline the importance of embedding Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic and Cultural (SLEEC) constraints within the development of future autonomous systems. A novel methodological approach is presented that combines Human Factors methods with Computer Science techniques to generate the environmental and situational requirements in combination with a computer rule-based requirements language. This approach also provides a possible structure for capturing contextual and situational information from key stakeholders in the development of autonomous systems. This structure will enable engagement with the stakeholders with respect to key elements identified from this interdisciplinary approach in a responsible way to ensure that future autonomous systems are user centred. The approach is domain independent, but it is applied here to the case of an autonomous assistive dressing robot that aids a user in a dressing task, with a specific critical event that requires a SLEEC resilient response},

This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the capability of large language models in ideating and designing culturally responsive projects for elementary and middle school programming classes. Our ultimate goal is to support K-8 teachers in effectively extracting suggestions from large language models by only using natural language modifications. Furthermore, we aim to develop a comprehensive assessment framework for culturally responsive AI-generated project ideas. We also hope to provide valuable insight into teachers’ perspectives on large language models and their integration into teaching practices.},

abstract = {In recent years, a proliferation of women’s safety mobile applications have emerged in India that crowdsource street safety perceptions to generate ‘safety maps’ used by policy makers for urban design and academics for studying mobility patterns. Men and women’s differential access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), however, and the distinctions between their social and cultural subjective experiences may mitigate the value of crowdsourced safety perceptions data and the predictive ability of machine learning (ML) models utilizing such data. We explore this by collecting and analyzing primary data on safety perceptions from New Delhi, India. Our curated dataset consists of streetviews covering a wide range of neighborhoods for which we obtain subjective safety ratings from both female and male respondents. Simulation experiments where varying the proportion of ratings from each gender are assumed missing demonstrate that the predictive ability of standard ML techniques relies crucially on the distribution of data producers. We find that obtaining large amounts of crowdsourced safety labels from male respondents for predicting female safety perceptions is inefficient in a number of scenarios and even undesirable in others. Detailed comparisons between female and male respondents’ data demonstrate significant gender differences in safety perceptions and associated vocabularies. Our results have important implications for the design of platforms relying on crowdsourced data and the insights generated from them.},

This might be due to the fact that the prevalent developer perspective immanently focuses on technological advancements, whereas a human-centered view remains underrepresented. In this paper, we argue that a human-centered perspective which integrates values and beliefs of relevant technology stakeholders needs to complement existing approaches to social robot design. Therefore, we propose to apply value sensitive design (VSD) to improve the process of social robot development and design. Even though VSD has become popular in recent years and it represents an established approach to foster innovative technologies, it has not yet been widely applied in the context of social robotics. Concretely, in this paper we will outline the added value of using VSD for social robots and we will explain how to utilize this methodology to enrich research and practice in social robotics.},

abstract = {Autistic children’s emotional meltdown is a common challenge faced by their caregivers, including their teachers and families. Communicating their problems can be extremely challenging for many autistic children, making it difficult for caregivers to identify the triggers of these meltdowns. Previous studies have revealed that autistic children find it easier to communicate with non-human objects, such as comfort dolls or social robots. In light of this, we have designed Kodi, a mobile virtual conversational agent aimed at bridging the communication gap between autistic children and their caregivers during distressing situations. Kodi’s appearance can be personalized to match the child’s favorite characters, such as a bunny or a dinosaur. To provide additional comfort, Kodi comes with furry phone cases that offer haptic stimulation. When the child faces stressful situations, caregivers can prompt Kodi on children’s mobile device, allowing the child to express their emotions with various input modalities (emojis, text, voice) and listen to soothing stories. Caregivers can tailor these stories to suit each child’s unique needs. Furthermore, Kodi will employ keyword analysis to summarize conversations, identify potential triggers for emotional meltdowns (e.g., loud noises in a shopping mall, unexpected changes at school), and alert caregivers of potential problems, such as bullying. The data collected through Kodi holds the potential to be leveraged for predicting emotional meltdowns using machine learning techniques. This paper discusses the implications of the Kodi platform and outlines future research directions in this area.},

In this paper, we explore the contribution of creative AI tools to overcome design fixation and enhance creative processes in HRI design. In a four weeks long design exploration, we used generative text-to-image models to ideate and visualise robotic artefacts and robot sociotechnical imaginaries. We exchanged results along with reflections through a digital postcard format. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to imagining novel robot concepts, surfacing existing assumptions and robot stereotypes, and situating robotic artefacts in context. We discuss the contribution to designerly HRI practices and conclude with lessons learnt for using creative AI tools as an emerging design practice in HRI research and beyond.},

The role of feminist theories in related fields (e.g. Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science) are taken as a starting point to present a vision for Feminist HRI which can support better, more ethical HRI practice everyday, as well as a more activist research and design stance. We first define feminist design for an HRI audience and use a set of feminist principles from neighboring fields to examine existent HRI literature, showing the progress that has been made already alongside some additional potential ways forward. Following this we identify a set of reflexive questions to be posed throughout the HRI design, research and development pipeline, encouraging a sensitivity to power and to individuals' goals and values. Importantly, we do not look to present a definitive, fixed notion of Feminist HRI, but rather demonstrate the ways in which bringing feminist principles to our field can lead to better, more ethical HRI, and to discuss how we, the HRI community, might do this in practice.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving mental health, and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content generation for mindfulness practice in these methods, high-quality computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However, the user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation, which requires emotional expressiveness. In addition, work has not yet been done to study the effect of physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS voices for mindfulness. To that end, we designed a two-phase human subject study. In Phase 1, an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471) evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with 2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists' voices in 3 different physical embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot) with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices. Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices, suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.},

Researchers have developed different methods for automatically detecting harmful content, often focusing on specific sub-problems or on narrow communities, as what is considered harmful often depends on the platform and on the context. We argue that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of harmful content online platforms seek to curb, and what research efforts there are to automatically detect such content. We thus survey existing methods as well as content moderation policies by online platforms in this light and suggest directions for future work.},

abstract = {Industry and media have long represented automation as a harbinger of development and convenience in different areas of life. An anxious prospect to some, automation systems promise “progress” and profitability to others by conjuring corporate computational futures. What remains behind the scenes of these predictions and imaginaries of automation is the invisible human labor of global ghost workers caring for, maintaining, and repairing technologies. Invisible but irreplaceable, computation performed by humans in precarious conditions fills gaps that computer technologies lack skills and sensibility for. In this hybrid workshop, we ask who the “ghosts” are in the machines. The workshop will address the ghostly presence of humans and human labor in automation and its challenges to HCI research and design.&nbsp;},

abstract = {Meaningful first-time interactions between humans and robots are important for learning functionality, shaping impressions, and building trust. Additionally, robots should be an inclusive tool, accessible to all, yet typical introductory human-robot interactions rely heavily on the human's visual perceptions. For children and young people with sight loss, this is can be problematic. Therefore, we present a preliminary workshop with four children and young people with sight loss in order to begin investigating how this population learns about social robots for the first time, their overall impressions of social robots, and whether games could assist in creating positive first-time interactions. Our initial findings reveal the importance of promoting tactile exploration, clarifying safety aspects, and careful consideration of the communication of robot emotion.},

abstract = {Physical touch (e.g., hugging, holding hands, petting an animal) plays a fundamental role in the provision of socio-emotional support. Touch-based interactions should thus be considered for socially assistive robots designed to provide similar support. However, the haptic properties of currently existing robots are limited. While research has shown possibilities of integrating life-like haptic cues (e.g., thermal, vibrotactile, pressure cues) into robotic interfaces, current understanding of user experiences with life-like haptic cues delivered by a robot, and their potential to regulate user affect, is insufficient. The current and proposed works investigate whether integrating life-like haptic cues into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) can enhance the socio-emotional support provided by socially assistive robots and improve the relationships with, and perceptions of such robots. The findings of this work will provide insights into user experiences of touching a socially assistive robot and their perceptions of life-like haptic cues. The contributions will provide concrete design suggestions on how haptic cues can be integrated into interfaces of socially assistive robots to enhance users' well-being during stress-inducing situations},

However, tweaking these text features can be challenging, especially given their interactions on the final look and feel of the text. Our solution is to offer readers preset combinations of font, character, word and line spacing, which we bundle together into reading themes. To arrive at a recommended set of reading themes, we combine crowdsourced text adjustments, ML-driven clustering of the resulting text formats, and design sessions. After four iterations of these steps, we converge on a set of three COR (Compact, Open, and Relaxed) themes that are designed for different readers.},

There is a limited understanding of how AI may perform in group decision-making. This paper presents a wizard-of-oz study in which two participants and an AI form a committee to rank three English essays. One novelty of our study is that we adopt a speculative design by endowing AI equal power to humans in group decision-making. We enable the AI to discuss and vote equally with other human members. We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions. Moreover, the divergent opinions of our participants regarding an “equal AI” shed light on the possible future of human-AI relations.},

Using “questionable values” as a lens, we retell and analyze four design scenarios for smart homes that were created by participants with an IoT toolkit we designed. The selected design scenarios reveal practices that violate principles of responsible smart home design. Through our analysis we show (1) how participants explore sensor-driven objectification of the home then leverage data for surveillance, nudging, and control over others; (2) how the dominant technosolutionist narratives of efficiency and productivity ground such questionable values; (3) and how the materiality of mass-produced sensors pre-mediates questionable design scenarios. We discuss how to attend to and utilize questionable values in design: Making space for questionable values will empower design researchers to better “look around corners”, anticipating tomorrow's concerns and forestalling the worst of their harms.},

The academic literature has, for example, highlighted the dangers of black-box decision-making and biased datasets. Furthermore, end-users’ ability to validate a system’s performance often disappears following the introduction of AI decision-making. We present the MAP model to understand and describe the three stages through which medical observations are interpreted and handled by AI systems. These stages are Measurement, in which information is gathered and converted into data points that can be stored and processed; Algorithm, in which computational processes transform the collected data; and Presentation, where information is returned to the user for interpretation. For each stage, we highlight possible challenges that need to be overcome to develop Human-Centred AI systems. We illuminate our MAP model through complementary case studies on colonoscopy practice and dementia diagnosis, providing examples of the challenges encountered in real-world settings. By defining Human-AI interaction across these three stages, we untangle some of the inherent complexities in designing AI technology for clinical decision-making, and aim to overcome misalignment between medical end-users and AI researchers and developers.},

Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) can be a useful participatory modeling tool that enables aggregation of individual perspectives to build system models that represent groups’ collective intelligence (CI). However, current FCM aggregation methodologies for creating CI models have rarely been tested and compared. We conducted 51 FCM interviews with local experts in the Flint, MI food system to map their mental models about how different food system sectors influenced desirable outcomes. Using four differing aggregation techniques, based on experts’ identity diversity and cognitive diversity, we generated four CI models. The models were compared based on their similarity to real-world complex systems using performance metrics like network structure, micro-motifs, cognitive distance, and scenario outcomes. We found that using cognitive diversity to group individuals was better suited for modeling systems with diverse holders of knowledge.},

In this paper, we present clinicians' perspectives on the prospective benefits and harms of voice data collection during health consultations. Such data collection is being proposed as a means to power models to assist clinicians with medical data entry, administrative tasks, and consultation analysis. Yet, clinicians' attitudes and concerns are largely absent from the AI narratives surrounding these use cases, and the academic literature investigating them. Our qualitative interview study used the concept of an informed consent process as a type of design fiction, to support elicitation of clinicians' perspectives on voice data collection and use associated with a fictional, near-term AI assistant. Through reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth sessions with physicians, we distilled eight classes of potential risks that clinicians are concerned about, including workflow disruptions, self-censorship, and errors that could impact patient eligibility for services. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of these prospective risks, reflect on the use of the speculative processes that illuminated them, and reconsider evaluation criteria for AI-assisted clinical documentation technologies in light of our findings.},

We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations—including plagiarism and bias—and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools.},

However, implementing digital transformation initiatives can be challenging, particularly in the public sector where processes and systems can be complex and bureaucratic, and as there no clear step-by-step guidelines to achieve a systematic, rigorous and repeatable result. The present paper aims at offering a valuable contribution to the field of digital transformation in the public sector, providing a practical and effective algorithmic method for business process reengineering and service digitalisation. The presented algorithmic approach to support the digital transformation of public sector services utilises process modelling tools, design patterns, innovative heuristics, simulation software and decision support systems. The method is demonstrated through a case study which involved the redesign of several hundreds of both internal processes and outward looking services in Greek local administration. Application results show significant improvements in process efficiency and effectiveness, repeatability and increased stakeholder satisfaction.},

We call this 50% frozen Mobile Net-V2 model as Mobile Freeze-Net. Secondly, we have proposed an Attention-based Loss function, which provides more attention to the class, having higher inter-class similarity. We have computed attention weights for each class from the statistical inference of the dataset itself, by employing a Monte-Carlo method and thereafter, we have incorporated those weights into WCCE loss function of Mobile Freeze-Net model. By utilizing Mobile freeze-Net, we have achieved testing accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall of 93%, 94%, 93% and 94% respectively. This is approximately 3-4% improvement compared to 100% fine tuning of Mobile-Net V2. Furthermore, we have achieved approximate 1-2% improvement of Mobile Freeze-Net, after incorporating Attention-based Loss function. For the validity of the proposed framework, we have conducted experiments with 10-fold cross validation. All these experimental results suggest that our proposed framework has outperformed other existing models considerably.},

In this work, we surveyed 103 design practitioners to assess current usages and associated barriers. Additionally, we analyzed and classified 161 decks of design cards from 1952-2020. We held a workshop with four experienced practitioners to generate initial categories, and then coded the remaining decks. We found that the cards contain seven different types of design knowledge: Creative Inspiration; Human Insights; Material &amp; Domain; Methods &amp; Tooling; Problem Definition; Team Building; and Values in Practice. The content of these cards can support designers across design stages; however, most are intended to support the early stages of design (e.g., research and ideation) rather than later design stages (e.g., prototyping and implementation). We share additional patterns uncovered and provide recommendations to support the future development and adoption of these tools.},

This survey and systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis on robotic vision in human-robot interaction and collaboration (HRI/C) over the past 10&nbsp;years. From a detailed search of 3,850 articles, systematic extraction and evaluation was used to identify and explore 310 papers in depth. These papers described robots with some level of autonomy using robotic vision for locomotion, manipulation, and/or visual communication to collaborate or interact with people. This article provides an in-depth analysis of current trends, common domains, methods and procedures, technical processes, datasets and models, experimental testing, sample populations, performance metrics, and future challenges. Robotic vision was often used in action and gesture recognition, robot movement in human spaces, object handover and collaborative actions, social communication, and learning from demonstration. Few high-impact and novel techniques from the computer vision field had been translated into HRI/C. Overall, notable advancements have been made on how to develop and deploy robots to assist people.},

abstract = {Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of 'human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for 'critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.},

abstract = {Although youth increasingly communicate with peers online, we know little about how private online channels play a role in providing a supportive environment for youth. To fill this gap, we asked youth to donate their Instagram Direct Messages and filtered them by the phrase “help me.” From this query, we analyzed 82 conversations comprised of 336,760 messages that 42 participants donated. These threads often began as casual conversations among friends or lovers they met offline or online. The conversations evolved into sharing negative experiences about everyday stress (e.g., school, dating) to severe mental health disclosures (e.g., suicide). Disclosures were usually reciprocated with relatable experiences and positive peer support. We also discovered unsupport as a theme, where conversation members denied giving support, a unique finding in the online social support literature. We discuss the role of social media-based private channels and their implications for design in supporting youth’s mental health. Content Warning: This paper includes sensitive topics, including self-harm and suicide ideation. Reader discretion is advised.},

Care robots are one example of existing robots that the general public has little awareness about. In this report, we introduce a card-based game prototype developed with the goal to bridge this gap and explore how people conceive of existing care robots as a part of their daily lives. Based on the trial game runs, we conclude that game-based approach is effective as a device to inform participants in a playful setting about existing care robots and to elicit conversations about the role such robots could play in their lives. In the future, we plan to adapt the prototype and create a design game prototype to develop novel use cases for care robots.},

Systematic reviews, a staple of many disciplines, play an important and often essential role in how each field contributes to human knowledge. On this prospect, we argue that our meta-level approach to research within HCI needs a revolution. First, we echo previous calls for greater rigour in primary research reporting with a view towards supporting knowledge synthesis in secondary research. Second, we must decide as a community how to carry out systematic review work in light of the many ways that knowledge is produced within HCI (rigour in secondary research methods and epistemological inclusivity). In short, our manifesto is this: we need to develop and make space for an inclusive but rigorous set of standards that supports systematic review work in HCI, through careful consideration of both primary and secondary research methods, expectations, and infrastructure. We call for any and all fellow systematic review-lutionaries to join us.},

When incorporated at the edge side, only lightweight deep neural network (DNN) models are affordable due to computational constraint. In this article, a cloud–edge collaborative architecture is proposed combining edge-based inference with cloud-assisted continuous learning. Lightweight DNN models are maintained at the edge servers and continuously retrained with a more comprehensive model on the cloud to achieve high video analytics performance while reducing the amount of data transmitted between edge servers and the cloud. The proposed design faces the challenge of constraints of both computation resources at the edge servers and network bandwidth of the edge–cloud links. An accuracy gradient-based resource allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate the limited computation and network resources across different video streams to achieve the maximum overall performance. A prototype system is implemented and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with up to 28.6% absolute mean average precision gain compared with alternative designs.},

abstract = {Human activity, economic and non-economic, is a core driver of global climate change. With urban areas as the epicentre of human activity, cities are simultaneously the greatest contributors and the best opportunities for addressing global climate change and sustaining – even enhancing – planetary wellbeing. Therefore, city-based, stakeholder-inclusive, and evidence-informed solutions could constitute a meaningful inquiry for sustainable development. Enduring, evolving, and emerging concepts of civic engagement, smart urbanism, and urban play demonstrate such promise, albeit with several caveats. This study investigates the use of gamified, digital tools in supporting the co-creation of more sustainable cities, through a systematic review, a structured precedent analysis, as well as a small group app trial and playtest of a mobile pervasive game called CO2rdinates. CO2rdinates is developed as a hybrid tool combining climate action, citizen participation, smart city technology, and playability, and proposed as a part of a holistic response to urban sustainability challenges. Participants of the app trial were generally supportive of the development of gamified tools for co-creating sustainable cities, and most felt that the CO2rdinates app could motivate and facilitate them in doing so. Several participants further expressed that the app could integrate into a wider campaign to promote sustainability awareness and action. However, the study also highlighted key challenges in the use of the CO2rdinates app, and, more broadly, the deployment of gamified digital tools for sustainability-informed, playful, and participatory city-making processes. These include a better integration of the three challenges in the CO2rdinates gameplay, and concerns about potential disputes among stakeholders. This study demonstrates that gamified digital participatory tools can constitute an empathetic, effective response to urban sustainability challenges through stimulating curiosity and learning, as well as facilitating action. There is scope for future work to integrate a wider range of stakeholders in the app trial and development, and to create more cohesively integrated yet inclusively varied game architectures and narratives. Strategies to mitigate, or even facilitate mutual learning from, conflicting views and interests, are also important future considerations.},

Through this work, we identify gaps in existing literature and highlight areas in need of further research in the domains of worker-centered technology development. Our analysis highlights how technologies such as algorithmic management shape roles and tasks in the high-touch service sector. We outline how harms produced through automation are often due to a lack of attention to non-management stakeholders. We then describe an opportunity space for researchers and practitioners to elicit worker participation at all stages of technology adoption, and offer methods for centering workers, increasing transparency, and accounting for the context of use through holistic implementation and training strategies.},

However, little is still known about how these factors interact. This paper presents a user study (N = 267) investigating the individual and combined effects of explanations, human oversight, and contestability on informational and procedural fairness perceptions for high- and low-stakes decisions in a loan approval scenario. We find that explanations and contestability contribute to informational and procedural fairness perceptions, respectively, but we find no evidence for an effect of human oversight. Our results further show that both informational and procedural fairness perceptions contribute positively to overall fairness perceptions but we do not find an interaction effect between them. A qualitative analysis exposes tensions between information overload and understanding, human involvement and timely decision-making, and accounting for personal circumstances while maintaining procedural consistency. Our results have important design implications for algorithmic decision-making processes that meet decision subjects’ standards of justice.},

abstract = {Citizens can increase openness, transparency, and accountability of institutions by taking part in face-to-face participatory policy-making deliberations, such as participatory budgeting assemblies. But for participants’ contributions to influence policy outcomes, organizers need to capture and synthesize participants’ input. Existing approaches are not inclusive for participants or require too much time from organizers. We designed e-scribing, a novel approach for capturing and synthesizing participants’ input from face-to-face deliberations in real time by combining scribes with digital technology. To evaluate the approach, we built DeliberationWorks, a digital deliberation technology that helps scribes (a) capture proxy input (i.e., as participants) that is complete and accurate so that participants do not need to interact with technology themselves and (b) synthesize the discussion in real time using labels. We deployed DeliberationWorks with 5 scribes in two face-to-face deliberations with 8-10 participants and found that, on average, 82% of the input was captured mostly accurately. After one hour of training, scribes synthesized input within 10 minutes of the end of the deliberation. Our findings suggest that e-scribing makes participatory policy-making more inclusive by allowing participants to share their input without interacting with technology, and more time-efficient by reducing synthesis and training times for organizers.},

abstract = {Economically disadvantaged migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable groups in healthcare. Studies have shown that chatbots can help patients and health professionals in healthcare settings. However, the design of health chatbots for migrant workers has not been thoroughly investigated. Scenario-based interviews with nineteen participants, including ten economically disadvantaged Thai migrant workers and nine relevant stakeholders, were conducted to examine how they seek healthcare, obtain health information, and communicate with health professionals to gain a deeper understanding of the barriers that migrant workers encounter in healthcare. The findings of the interview show that migrant workers face a variety of barriers, such as a lack of familiarity with the healthcare system in the host country, language barriers, cultural barriers to seeking healthcare, and communication barriers with health professionals. Then, the technological design strategies and the benefits of health chatbots from the perspective of migrant workers were discussed, including their potential to help migrant workers navigate the healthcare system step-by-step, obtain reliable health information, improve their health literacy, and facilitate communication with health professionals. Finally, five design implications for chatbots were proposed to guide future development of health chatbots to help migrant workers. Policymakers and health professionals can benefit from the design implications of migrant worker-centered health chatbots when they develop health chatbots that promote the health and well-being of migrant workers.},

abstract = {Vis-a-vis the digital innovation, i.e. Open Government Data (OGD), in the annals of public administration, the impetus upon user engagement holds eminence given the possibilities unleashed via value derivation. However, user engagement depends to a large extent to which OGD platforms deliver in terms of information expectations of the user. In this vein, the significance of “information scent”, i.e. the propensity of a user to dig deeper into a web portal based on the quality aligned with the intrinsic goal of the user, assumes importance for facilitating optimum user engagement with the OGD portal. Drawing inferences from the experts’ opinion, this study seeks to present possible research themes around this edifice. Given that OGD-research has underscored the need for website maintenance in terms of provisioning quality OGD and conducive portal features for furthering user engagement, the significance of information scent via OGD portals for consistent user engagement merits consideration for furthering the contours of OGD literature.},

abstract = {Nonverbal sound offers great potential to enhance robots’ interactions with humans, and a growing body of research has begun to explore nonverbal sound for tasks such as sound source localization, explicit communication, and improving sociability. However, nonverbal sound has a broad interpretation and design space that can draw from areas such as machine learning, music theory, and foley. We sought to identify and compare use cases and approaches for nonverbal sound in human-robot interaction through a systematic review. A search of sound and robotics-related publisher databases yielded 148 peer-reviewed articles presenting systems, studies, and taxonomies. Differences in taxonomy and overlap of terminology with adjacent research fields such as speech, gaze, and gesture posed difficulties for the search, which we attempted to address through a multi-stage search process. Based on the reviewed articles, we developed a pair of taxonomies using scientific communication principles and analyzed study designs and measures for the creation of nonverbal robot sound. We discuss recommendations for the field, including the use of the new taxonomies; methods for design, generation, and validation; and paths for future research. Roboticists may benefit from incorporating nonverbal sound as a key component in multimodal human-robot interaction.},

However, there is no explicit incentive and little-to-no training for writing reviews.

Many of the requests and commentary found within this piece are paraphrased from reviews we have received of our own qualitative research. Using this playful reversal, we promote discussion around responsible review practices, the inclusion of more transparent research where bias, ethics, potential harm, and positionality are explicitly discussed across methodologies and epistemologies.},

There is emerging consensus that those who design technology must support children's privacy and security. However, privacy and security are complex concepts that are challenging to design for, and centering the interests of children is similarly difficult. Through a document analysis of 90 HCI publications, we examine what problems and solutions designing for children's privacy and security addresses and how this research engages with children. Applying Solove's privacy taxonomy, we find that research addresses a range of problems related to information collection, processing, dissemination, and invasion at the organizational, system, and individual levels. Children's participation in this research is largely limited to providing feedback rather than helping to guide the research itself. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for designers to sharpen their privacy and security contributions and center children in their work.},

This paper explores the current apprenticeship strategies in radiation oncology, proposes designs, and develops a prototype to enhance the transfer of knowledge from experts to residents. We introduce three feedback mechanisms comprising visual and text-based elements that outline the degree of overlap with expert contour, specific guidance on over- and under-contoured regions, and long-term toxicity for tumors and nearby organs at risk. The design strategies of this work can inform the design of other learning platforms (in healthcare and beyond) to improve the delivery and access of expert feedback in apprenticeship models.},

The tools proposed by experts support stakeholders by improving how text is compressed, expanded, reviewed, and experienced. In a survey of stakeholders, we confirm that the scenarios are relevant and that the proposed tools appear helpful to them. We provide the Accessible Text Framework to help researchers understand how the different tools can be combined and discuss how individual tools can be implemented.

However, attempting to handle identity characteristics raises a number of critical ethical concerns, especially given the spatiotemporal dynamics of these characteristics. In this paper I question whether human identity characteristics can and should be represented, recognized, or reasoned about by robots, with special attention paid to the construct of race, due to its relative lack of consideration within the HRI community. As I will argue, while there are a number of well-warranted reasons why HRI researchers might want to enable robotic consideration of identity characteristics, these reasons are outweighed by a number of key ontological, perceptual, and deployment-oriented concerns. This argument raises troubling questions as to whether robots should even be able to understand or generate descriptions of people, and how they would do so while avoiding these ethical concerns. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of what this means for the HRI community, in terms of both algorithm and robot design, and speculate as to possible paths forward.},

During SH training, health workers are invited to enact scenarios with patients, examining their reactions and responses as they learn more about the "history" of their patients and of their assumed characters as health workers. This training has resulted in improvement in empathic skills for health workers, but opportunities to scale the intervention are limited. The SH is costly to implement, requiring in-person workshops and facilitator training for small groups of workers. Our mobile application may either supplement or introduce the SH concepts at scale to health workers. The stories have been co-designed with mental health experts, midwives, and other trainers, and employ a "choose-your-own-adventure" approach, slowly revealing the histories of the characters, as in the original SH protocol. To inform decisions of the app design, data was collected through interviews, co-design workshops and focus group discussions as detailed in the methods section.},

abstract = {The number of hackathon events worldwide has nearly quadrupled in the last five years. Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.},

abstract = {Many industries are facing the challenge of how to capture workers’ knowledge such that it can be shared, in particular tacit knowledge. The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines.},

abstract = {The consumption of digital audiovisual media is a mainstay of many people’s lives. However, people with accessibility needs often have issues accessing this content. With a view to addressing this inequality, there exists a wide range of interventions that researchers have explored to bridge this accessibility gap. Despite this work, our understanding of the capability of these interventions is poor. In this paper, we address this through a systematic review of the literature, creating a dataset of and analysing N = 181 scientific papers. We have found that certain areas have accrued a disproportionate amount of attention from the research community – for example, blind and visually impaired and d/Deaf and hard of hearing people account for of papers (N = 170). We describe challenges researchers have addressed, end-user communities of focus, and interventions examined. We conclude by evaluating gaps in the literature and areas that could use more focus on in the future.},

In service of that, we have conducted 30 interviews from the partner heads of an EU-funded project as well as quadruple helix actors from each region in the Baltic Sea Region (Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Lithuania, Denmark, and St. Petersburg) to deeply understand the functionalities that are needed to be offered by the platform. A deductive thematic analysis has been conducted to analyse these functionalities in terms of collective intelligence (CI) components (namely staffing, processes, goals, and motivation) based on a most recent generic CI model. The functionalities were further evaluated by experts working in the field of science and technology in the silver economy. Overall, this article offers insights into the functionalities that are required for a digital collaborative platform to support the elderly population and facilitate co-creation among quadruple helix actors, as well as provides a foundation for future work on designing and implementing such a platform.},

Whether a game is sufficiently balanced greatly influences its reception, satisfaction, churn rates and success. In particular, different ideologies of balance can lead to worse player experiences than actual imbalances. This work succeeds a fine-grained investigation about the attitudes of the Guild Wars 2 community regarding balancing factors, and introduces a player-driven quantitative tool to approximate closer configurations of balance that could optimize player experience and satisfaction. After an initial evaluation, theoretical constellation outputs of this tool improved players’ perception of the balance between in-game build options – where aggregated opinions of (n = 64) players even showed benefits over individual opinions, indicating a potential “wisdom of the crowd” effect.},

We analyse a total of 181 illustrations from 137 papers to understand the diverse ways in which robot movements are illustrated as well as how each style supports and limits information about the movements. We identify 10 basic styles that are used. Based on a visual analysis of these styles, we provide a detailed examination of each. This paper contributes with an overview that can be used to support future dissemination within the HRI research community. We present four aspects to consider for future illustrations and a discussion on how our findings could be utilised in early design processes.},

Transparency, however, has yet to be scrutinized to the same degree as accountability and fairness. As a result, we don't know: What does this community mean when it talks about transparency? How are we doing transparency? And to what ends? What commitments does (or should) the T in FAccT signify? This paper interrogates the T in FAccT using perspectives from critical transparency literature. Subsequently, we argue that FAccT might be better off dropping the T from its title for two reasons: (1) transparency can often be counterproductive to FAccT's primary objectives and (2) it is misleading as FAccT is mainly preoccupied with explainability rather than actual transparency. If we want to keep the T, we need to reframe how we think about and do transparency by making transparency contingent, reclaiming it from explainability, and bringing people into transparency processes.},

It extends the traditional configuration of virtual spaces by offering a more immersive, interactive, and social experience. Unfortunately, there is insufficient literature on how to develop a metaverse application aligned with academic standards and best practices. In this study, we adopted a co-design approach in remodeling our mobile educational metaverse to draw a blueprint for existing and future metaverse technology adopters. We sent a follow-up survey to stakeholders inviting free-text comments. This survey focused on the challenges, issues, and expected features from the perspectives of developers, teachers, and students, respectively. Our results revealed several challenges that developers face when building a metaverse, such as technical infrastructure, student engagement, avatar customization, and performance optimization. Meanwhile, teachers emphasized potential issues that may arise from the use of metaverse technology in educational settings, such as learning outcomes, health and safety, digital citizenship, and ethics and morality. Finally, students expected several key features of an educational metaverse application, such as socialization and collaboration, virtual world interactions, metaverse optimization, realistic graphics, and minigames and activities. The implications of these findings are significant and can help other educational institutions seeking to integrate metaverse technology into their academic services. Overall, our study presents an initial foundation for further exploration and advancement within the rapidly evolving field of metaverse technology.},

This paper addresses the shift in question from a sociological perspective and proposes to bring it even further to include a systematic study of human 'lived experiences' taking place in the community contexts. The ultimate goal is to facilitate theoretical and methodological developments needed to systematically address and pursue research on the 'HRI of Everyday Life'.},

This work contributes to the discussion by unpacking co-production challenges faced by practitioners as they align their RAI values. We interviewed 23 individuals, across 10 organizations, tasked to ship AI/ML based products while upholding RAI norms and found that both top-down and bottom-up institutional structures create burden for different roles preventing them from upholding RAI values, a challenge that is further exacerbated when executing conflicted values. We share multiple value levers used as strategies by the practitioners to resolve their challenges. We end our paper with recommendations for inclusive and equitable RAI value-practices, creating supportive organizational structures and opportunities to further aid practitioners.},

To gain a better understanding of the interaction between community members and dispatchers using text-based risk reporting systems, this study conducts a system log analysis ofLiveSafe, a community safety reporting system, to provide empirical evidence of the conversational patterns between users and dispatchers using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We created an ontology to capture information (e.g., location, attacker, target, weapon, start-time, and end-time, etc.) that dispatchers often collected from users regarding their incident tips. Applying the proposed ontology, we found that dispatchers often asked users for different information across varied event types (e.g.,Attacker forAbuse andAttack events,Target forHarassment events). Additionally, using emotion detection and regression analysis, we found an inconsistency in dispatchers' emotional support and responsiveness to users' messages between different organizations and between incident categories. The results also showed that users had a higher response rate and responded quicker when dispatchers provided emotional support. These novel findings brought significant insights to both practitioners and system designers, e.g., AI-based solutions to augment human agents' skills for improved service quality.},

abstract = {The transition of urban energy supply into a regenerative but also digitalized smart ecosystem leads to an unprecedented necessity to rethink the energy supply infrastructure in city districts. Recent research strongly suggests that it is highly beneficial to consider platform solutions holistically as a cyber-physical-social infrastructure system. However, there are few detailed descriptions of the practical implementation of such a system. We aim to close this gap by presenting the findings from the real-world implementation of a district community platform as a cyber-physical-social infrastructure system. In doing so, we address the energy systems, the relevant (time series) data and services as well as the stakeholders involved.},

Digital interventions can create spaces that promote social inclusion and cohesion. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of a cultural heritage and digital storytelling application supporting a participatory approach to culture and hosting society. We evaluate our intervention in three marginalized communities with different social-cultural contexts: migrant women in Barcelona, a community living in a priority neighbourhood in Paris and second and third-generation migrants in Lisbon. Through an analysis of their application use, our findings point at their needs and desires, highlighting how the app can support social inclusion as the first step towards cohesion, but that these are heterogeneous concepts susceptible to nuanced appropriations by the different communities.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems underpin many of our society’s critical infrastructures. Ensuring their cyber security is important and complex. A major activity in this regard is cyber security incident response, whose primary goal is to detect and mitigate cyber-attacks in order to ensure the continuity and resilience of services. For cyber-physical systems this is particularly challenging because it requires insights both from the cyber and physical (process) domains and the engagement of stakeholders that are not strictly concerned with cyber security. A technology that is receiving a lot of attention are digital twins – virtual representations of real-world (cyber-physical) systems. They can be used to support tasks such as estimating the state of a system and exploring the consequences of interventional activities (e.g., upgrades). In this paper, we examine the use of digital twins to support cyber security. Specifically, our novel contribution is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the types of activities and how different modalities of digital twin use can be applied to the phases of cyber security incident response. Building on this analysis, we propose a structured approach to enhancing cyber security playbooks for cyber-physical systems incident response with digital twins. Playbooks are an essential component of incident response, ensuring that multi-disciplinary teams are effective in responding to cyber security incidents; therefore, improvements in their execution can result in increased resilience. To illustrate our approach, we present its use for a playbook that is concerned with mitigating a cyber-attack to critical industrial equipment.},

abstract = {Social change projects, such as those undertaken under the banner of information &amp; communication technologies for development (ICT4D), frequently address problems using a design-based approach and therefore inherit the values of what could be called “classical design.” One of those values, as we demonstrate through an examination of popular design textbooks, is to accommodate people’s needs, abilities, and behaviors. Accommodating people as they are, however, is very different from encouraging the internal changes in people – as either individuals or societies – that are required for meaningful social change. The inclinations of classical design are thus poorly matched to efforts intended to lead to social change. We flesh out this argument through an examination of classical design’s underlying ethos, an articulation of the difference between social good and social change, case studies of three ICT4D design efforts, and analysis of the implications of “giving people what they want.” We conclude with a call to draw a clear line between design for convenience or efficiency and innovation for social change in ICT4D pedagogy, research, and practice.},

abstract = {Algorithms in public services such as child welfare, criminal justice, and education are increasingly being used to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. Drawing upon findings from a two-year ethnography conducted at a child welfare agency, we highlight how algorithmic systems are embedded within a complex decision-making ecosystem at critical points of the child welfare process. Caseworkers interact with algorithms in their daily lives where they must collect information about families and feed it to algorithms to make critical decisions. We show how the interplay between systemic mechanics and algorithmic decision-making can adversely impact the fairness of the decision-making process itself. We show how functionality issues in algorithmic systems can lead to process-oriented harms where they adversely affect the nature of professional practice, and administration at the agency, and lead to inconsistent and unreliable decisions at the street level. In addition, caseworkers are compelled to undertake additional labor in the form of repair work to restore disrupted administrative processes and decision-making, all while facing organizational pressures and time and resource constraints. Finally, we share the case study of a simple algorithmic tool that centers caseworkers’ decision-making within a trauma-informed framework and leads to better outcomes, however, required a significant amount of investments on the agency’s part in creating the ecosystem for its proper use.},

While HRI has explored different ways in which robots could sound, we focus on the range of actions that a single sound can accomplish in interaction. In a Research through Design study involving autonomous shuttle buses in public transport, we explored sound design with the help of voice-overs to video recordings of the buses on the road and Wizard-of-Oz tests in live traffic. The buses are slowed down by (unnecessary) braking in response to people getting close. We found that prolonged jingles draw attention to the bus and invite interaction, while repeated short beeps and bell sounds can instruct the movement of others away from the bus. We highlight the importance of designing sound in sequential interaction and describe a new method for embedding video interaction analysis in the design process.},

Multi Sensory Environments (MSEs) are spaces that allow for several interaction modalities that stimulate users’ senses and allow the collection of multimodal data. In educational contexts, they provide opportunities to support children’s learning in a playful manner. The use of MSEs is usually carried out with the collaboration of teachers; their perspectives and responsibilities are crucial for the children’s experience. The goal of our research is to uncover evidence-based challenges and opportunities, while considering teachers’ experiences. We conducted fourteen semi-structured interviews with teachers (n = 6) and researchers (n = 8) experienced using MSEs’, and analysed the identified challenges and considerations during a workshop with four Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) experts. We offer a series of implications for consideration when designing and/or using MSEs to support children’s learning.},

In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 27 AI ethics toolkits to critically examine how the work of ethics is imagined and how it is supported by these toolkits. Specifically, we examine the discourses toolkits rely on when talking about ethical issues, who they imagine should do the work of ethics, and how they envision the work practices involved in addressing ethics. Among the toolkits, we identify a mismatch between the imagined work of ethics and the support the toolkits provide for doing that work. In particular, we identify a lack of guidance around how to navigate labor, organizational, and institutional power dynamics as they relate to performing ethical work. We use these omissions to chart future work for researchers and designers of AI ethics toolkits.},

Utilizing Twitter as a case study, the essay critically examines the power dynamics, values, and interests that shape the design and implementation of digital technologies and their impact on social participation. The framework presented in this essay identifies two interconnected layers of social participation in the digital context: 1) employing technology as a tool for social participation and 2) actively engaging in the construction and political dynamics of technology itself. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the study argues that the current privatization of the technosphere and its governance by a few powerful corporations poses significant threats to democracy, equity, and the public interest. The essay claims strategies for fostering democratic engagement within the technosphere, such as developing public digital infrastructure, implementing transparency and accountability measures, and empowering civil society. By actively involving diverse stakeholders in developing, governance, and evaluating digital technologies, this essay advocates for a more inclusive and democratic technosphere that genuinely serves the public interest. This essay contributes to the academic discourse on the role of digital technologies in shaping our social, political, and economic lives and calls for further interdisciplinary research to explore the technosphere for democratic participation. By critically examining and addressing the power dynamics inherent in digital technologies, we can work towards a more inclusive, equitable, and democratic digital ecosystem.},

abstract = {Trucking industry and truck drivers’ work are undergoing a change as automation is increasingly used to improve the efficiency of transport operations. Despite predictions of trucking work to disappear due to automation studies show human intervention is still needed in trucking. Generally, studies on future of work and changes digitalization brings to work practice focus is often in in-organization issues, leaving the larger context and external actors unstudied. We take the higher-level viewpoint, asking what kind of actors and factors have an effect in the change in the trucking work practice, and what kind of involvement the actors have in the change. We analyzed 40 interviews, utilizing User Involvement Centered Design model as our lens, and created an illustrative case for the trucking industry to make visible how a collection of decisions, designs, and digital solutions affect the work practice of truck drivers.},

However, our formative study found that when teaching new NL inputs, users require assistance in clarifying ambiguities that arise and want insight into which parts of the input the NLI understands. In this paper we introduce ONYX, an intelligent agent that interactively learns new NL inputs by combining NL programming and programming-by-demonstration, also known as multi-modal interactive task learning. To address the aforementioned challenges, ONYX provides suggestions on how ONYX could handle new NL inputs based on previously learned concepts or user-defined procedures, and poses follow-up questions to clarify ambiguities in user demonstrations, using visual and textual aids to clarify the connections. Our evaluation shows that users provided with ONYX’s new features achieved significantly higher accuracy in teaching new NL inputs (median: 93.3%) in contrast to those without (median: 73.3%).},

However, international students' mental well-being remains underexplored in HCI. In this study, we conducted remote synchronous remote co-design sessions with 19 participants (14 international students, 5 mental health professionals) to understand concretely what types of designs for interactive technologies suit these students' mental health needs and challenges. Based on their brainstormed ideas and sketches, we produced a set of design dimensions that span different types of support, interaction, and safety. The dimensions were then used to develop a set of four medium-fidelity mockups that spanned these dimensions, presenting a diverse range of design features. Using these mockups, we elicited feedback in an online survey from the same participants. Findings suggest that the students negotiate a complex understanding of helpfulness, comfort, and trust when they consider what types of designs to consider using. Each mockup highlights different ways to support individual differences and preferences. Our work serves as a foundation for designing technologies that can ease issues with accessibility and be more inclusive of international students' cultural backgrounds.},

abstract = {AI-based design tools are proliferating in professional software to assist engineering and industrial designers in complex manufacturing and design tasks. These tools take on more agentic roles than traditional computer-aided design tools and are often portrayed as “co-creators.” Yet, working effectively with such systems requires different skills than working with complex CAD tools alone. To date, we know little about how engineering designers learn to work with AI-based design tools. In this study, we observed trained designers as they learned to work with two AI-based tools on a realistic design task. We find that designers face many challenges in learning to effectively co-create with current systems, including challenges in understanding and adjusting AI outputs and in communicating their design goals. Based on our findings, we highlight several design opportunities to better support designer-AI co-creation.},

Through a co-design approach, we explored the potential for Smart City technology to create urban environments that are safe for women. We ran a set of online co-design sessions, starting with three mixed and then eight city-specific sessions with female-identifying persons from Berlin, Melbourne and Cairo. Through these, requirements of women for smart city technology were explored and analysed in connection to the contexts of the respective cities. We found that in terms of practical solutions, ideas are always bound to the local context of the city, to routines of women’s lifestyle, as well as to cultural specifics of the place. Nevertheless, general requirements for Smart City solutions across all cities similarly concern “Preventive measures”, “Reactive measures”, “Reporting support” and “Systematic changes”.},

abstract = {Today, so-called persuasive or motivational technologies are developing, which refer to technologies, applications or services designed to induce changes in attitudes and behavior in those who use them. This is the subject of research in Human-Computer Interaction in connection with theories from psychology related, for example, to behavior change or motivation. Research on these technologies suggests that in order to encourage long-term adherence, these "virtual coaches" need to be personalized and/or tailored according to the individual characteristics of the users (stage of behavior change, motivations, preferences, barriers). For example, according to the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), an individual can present different forms of motivation, more or less effective. The idea is to be able to identify the forms of motivation present in users in order to propose services to reinforce or develop them. The use of such systems in the field of health has the potential to induce and reinforce health behaviors that are sometimes difficult to establish by health professionals. Providing daily, personalized care represents a considerable human and financial cost for health professionals. A mobile application has the advantage of being able to deal with these constraints. The computer coach is designed with and for patients suffering from chronic low back pain. The aim is to help them manage their condition, particularly with regard to their pain and the practice of regular physical activity. The work presented presents an innovative design approach, combining user-centered methodologies and psychological theories, which we detail through a research phase and a design phase. Currently, a first version of the application has been developed and is being tested.},

We are inspired by studies that integrate real-world environments into computational models, including bifocal modeling and participatory simulation, and those that leverage Augmented Reality (AR) to create authoring tools for children. We describe our design goals that focus on raising the ceiling and lowering the threshold for potential AR designers: researchers, educators, and children. For the IDC conference, we propose an example learning activity to demonstrate the capabilities of NetLogo AR. By incorporating dynamic and unpredictable real-world inputs, NetLogo AR has the potential to inspire future designs of AR experiences and enrich the learning experiences of agent-based models for children.},

abstract = {Autoscanning of an unknown environment is the key to many AR/VR and robotic applications. However, autonomous reconstruction with both high efficiency and quality remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a reconstruction-oriented autoscanning approach, called ScanBot, which utilizes hierarchical deep reinforcement learning techniques for global region-of-interest (ROI) planning to improve the scanning efficiency and local next-best-view (NBV) planning to enhance the reconstruction quality. Given the partially reconstructed scene, the global policy designates an ROI with insufficient exploration or reconstruction. The local policy is then applied to refine the reconstruction quality of objects in this region by planning and scanning a series of NBVs. A novel mixed 2D-3D representation is designed for these policies, where a 2D quality map with tailored quality channels encoding the scanning progress is consumed by the global policy, and a coarse-to-fine 3D volumetric representation that embodies both local environment and object completeness is fed to the local policy. These two policies iterate until the whole scene has been completely explored and scanned. To speed up the learning of complex environmental dynamics and enhance the agent's memory for spatial-temporal inference, we further introduce two novel auxiliary learning tasks to guide the training of our global policy. Thorough evaluations and comparisons are carried out to show the feasibility of our proposed approach and its advantages over previous methods.

abstract = {The advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has brought substantial progress in image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. However, most SR methods pursue deep architectures to boost performance, and the resulting large model sizes are impractical for real-world applications. Furthermore, they insufficiently explore the internal structural information of image features, disadvantaging the restoration of fine texture details. To solve these challenges, we propose a lightweight architecture based on a CNN named attention-directed feature aggregation network (AFAN), consisting of chained stacking multi-aware attention modules (MAAMs) and a simple channel attention module (SCAM), for image SR. Specifically, in each MAAM, we construct a space-aware attention block (SAAB) and a dimension-aware attention block (DAAB) that individually yield unique three-dimensional modulation coefficients to adaptively recalibrate structural information from an asymmetric convolution residual block (ACRB). The synergistic strategy captures multiple content features that are both space-aware and dimension-aware to preserve more fine-grained details. In addition, to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the network, SCAM is embedded in the last MAAM to highlight channels with high activated values at low computational load. Comprehensive experiments verify that our proposed network attains high qualitative accuracy while employing fewer parameters and moderate computational requirements, exceeding most state-of-the-art lightweight approaches.},

Considering climate change and other pressures on food production, HCI scholars have increasingly begun to examine how the field should approach agricultural innovation. We conducted a literature review of HCI research through the lens of competing future visions for good food systems : a “conventional” vision of profit-oriented production, and an “alternative” which prioritizes sustainability and community-led practices. Leveraging the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, we provide an empirical analysis of how HCI and adjacent applied computing projects align with these competing visions for agriculture. This review reveals, amongst other findings, a prioritization of the perspectives of the Global North and a need for more careful attention to the constraints and aspirations of subsistence farmers. Finally, we note the limits of the conventional-alternative binary that shapes much of contemporary HCI research focused on agriculture and offer opportunities for transcending this framing.},

abstract = {Within the last few decades, data science has risen towards the top of agendas in public services such as adult social care. Concomitant with this ever-increasing appetite for data science is an expanding catalogue of challenges associated with developing, deploying, and maintaining data science software: choosing the appropriate, if any, analytical technique to use; balancing competing conceptions of success; and sustaining user adoption. In my thesis, I argue that these are sociotechnical challenges: issues that arise in the tension between what people do, and how data science software supports, limits, and, crucially, changes what they do. Through design science research, this thesis will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a design approach for data science software that attempts to address such sociotechnical challenges. The empirical sites in which these research activities will take place are live data science projects with local government organisations responsible for adult social care services in England. The resultant approach will include a conceptual model for sociotechnical data science, process guidance and methods for applying the design approach, and results from applying the approach in a real-world data science project in collaboration with an industry partner.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons.},

abstract = {Homophily is a fundamental sociological theory that describes the tendency of individuals to interact with others who share similar attributes. This theory has shown evident relevance for studying collaborative learning and classroom orchestration in learning analytics research from a social constructivist perspective. Emerging advancements in multimodal learning analytics have shown promising results in capturing interaction data and generating socio-spatial analytics in physical learning spaces through computer vision and wearable positioning technologies. Yet, there are limited ways for analysing homophily (e.g., social network analysis; SNA), especially for unpacking the temporal connections between different homophilic behaviours. This paper presents a novel analytic approach, Social-epistemic Network Analysis (SeNA), for analysing homophily by combining social network analysis with epistemic network analysis to infuse socio-spatial analytics with temporal insights. The additional insights SeNA may offer over traditional approaches (e.g., SNA) were illustrated through analysing the homophily of 98 students in open learning spaces. The findings showed that SeNA could reveal significant behavioural differences in homophily between comparison groups across different learning designs, which were not accessible to SNA alone. The implications and limitations of SeNA in supporting future learning analytics research regarding homophily in physical learning spaces are also discussed.},

The qualitative analysis, performed by iterative affinity diagramming, of interviews, observations, and a co-design session with five of the children, suggests that familiar situations were characterized by contemplation and curiosity, while unfamiliar ones were characterized by surprise or confusion. The temporal structure of past, present, and future situations in the field of attention played a significant role in the children’s experiences. This leads to design considerations for an explainable interior of self-driving buses.},

At present, there is a pressing need of synthesizing and extracting key insights from prior literature to formulate a systematic understanding of what constitutes a moderation experience and to explore how such understanding could further inform moderation-related research and practices. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by analyzing 42 empirical studies related to moderation experiences and published between January 2016 and March 2022. We describe these studies' characteristics and how they characterize users' moderation experiences. We further identify five primary perspectives that prior researchers use to conceptualize moderation experiences. These findings suggest an expansive scope of research interests in understanding moderation experiences and considering moderated users as an important stakeholder group to reflect on current moderation design but also pertain to the dominance of the punitive, solutionist logic in moderation and ample implications for future moderation research, design, and practice.},

abstract = {Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) lack resources, hindering the quality and quantity of service they can deliver. Meanwhile, NPOs at times have underutilized or even spare resources due to the inability to scale expertise in staffing and tangible resources to meet temporally shifting service demands. These observations motivate us to propose a novel resource sharing system, SWAP, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first resource sharing system that facilitates resource exchanges where NPOs can obtain resources by offering their own. SWAP consists of four elements: a collaborative auction-based sharing process, complete with an offering mechanism, a bidding mechanism, and the virtual currency, SWAPcredit, to facilitate liquidity in exchange; a central technology that represents the award determination problem with a multilateral exchange optimization model, generating resource exchange outcomes; an online platform, the SWAP Hub, where NPOs can offer and bid on available resources, and receive exchange results; and human-centric co-design, shaping the understanding and design decisions of a research collective, that includes the authors and NPO professionals. We conduct a series of experiments using both empirical and simulated data to illustrate the benefits and potential of SWAP. Our results demonstrate that SWAP can address temporal resource needs in practice; show that optimal exchange outcomes can be generated even for large-scale SWAP markets; and provide strong evidence in support of guidance to inform the progression for future versions of SWAP. The SWAP system is presently implemented in Howard County, MD, USA, with ongoing enhancements and potential for future expansion.},

Modern synthesizers can produce thousands of unique timbres, but this complexity hinders musicians’ ability to explore these timbres effectively. We contribute SoundTraveller, an interactive timbre exploration system aimed at fostering electronic musicians’ creative processes. SoundTraveller allows the user to explore the timbral space using two modes: evolutionary and morphing, with which they can generate hundreds of unique timbres without the need to edit individual parameters. Our user study confirmed that SoundTraveller supported participants’ exploration, decreased their cognitive load, and increased their perceived creativity. Through analysis of our interview study, we contribute design considerations for timbre exploration systems, and for exploring large aesthetic parameter spaces more generally. Finally, we discuss how systems like SoundTraveller can fit into the existing workflows of electronic music composers, and how shared agency with creative technologies can impact the creative process.},

abstract = {Many robot-delivered health interventions aim to support people longitudinally at home to complement or replace in-clinic treatments. However, there is little guidance on how robots can support collaborative goal setting (CGS). CGS is the process in which a person works with a clinician to set and modify their goals for care; it can improve treatment adherence and efficacy. However, for home-deployed robots, clinicians will have limited availability to help set and modify goals over time, which necessitates that robots support CGS on their own. In this work, we explore how robots can facilitate CGS in the context of our robot CARMEN (Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation), which delivers neurorehabilitation to people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). We co-designed robot behaviors for supporting CGS with clinical neuropsychologists and PwMCI, and prototyped them on CARMEN. We present feedback on how PwMCI envision these behaviors supporting goal progress and motivation during an intervention. We report insights on how to support this process with home-deployed robots and propose a framework to support HRI researchers interested in exploring this both in the context of cognitively assistive robots and beyond. This work supports designing and implementing CGS on robots, which will ultimately extend the efficacy of robot-delivered health interventions.},

While much privacy research has focused on how users perceive privacy and interact with companies, we focus on how privacy legislation is discussed among a different set of relationships-those between companies and investors. This paper investigates how companies translate the GDPR and CCPA into business risks in documents created for investors. We conduct a qualitative document analysis of annual regulatory filings (Form 10-K) from nine major technology companies. We outline five ways that technology companies consider GDPR and CCPA as business risks, describing both direct and indirect ways that the legislation may affect their businesses. We highlight how these findings are relevant for the broader CSCW and privacy research communities in research, design, and practice. Creating meaningful privacy changes within existing institutional structures requires some understanding of the dynamics of these companies' decision-making processes and the role of capital.},

While such a characteristic may be a troubling property for AI user experience designers, it also imbues an intelligent system with an open-ended quality, empowering end-users to ‘design’ their own system in use to achieve more desired experiences. In light of this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 16 users of various AI-based everyday recommender systems, investigating how people design their AI user experiences in actual use contexts. Exploring people’s current experiences of adopting and adapting those systems to achieve their own desired experiences, we discovered three styles of end-user design of their experiences: teaching, resisting, and repurposing. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings, recognizing end-users’ motivation to challenge a prescribed experience of an intelligent system.},

Applying a mixed-methods approach, agile IoT practitioners around the world and from diverse industries were surveyed and interviewed. Our study recommends that Agile Software Development team makeup, practices, and methods should be tailored to the specific industry, culture, people, and IT application of an organization. People play an important role in the success of agile projects; therefore, our research focuses on identifying the critical attributes of agile teams to maximize success.

This enhancement can be effectively achieved by using smart service systems that focus on value co-creation among all stakeholders. In general, these services have to be engineered in a special way tailored to the particular community and use case at hand. In this paper, we propose an engineering approach centered on the concept of the citizen developer for creating, maintaining and managing those smart services. By using a domain-specific modelling language specially tailored to the smart region context, we develop a platform capable of generating smart services from a high-level description including data sources, transformations and visualizations. This results in an efficient and cost-effective development approach where the stakeholders of the smart region context themselves lead the process of building, deploying and implementing the relevant use-cases for their communities.},

abstract = {Societal implications of technology are often considered after public deployment. However, broader impacts ought to be considered during the onset and throughout development to reduce potential for harmful uses, biases, and exclusions. There is a need for tools and frameworks that help technologists become more aware of broader contexts of their work and engage in more responsible and inclusive practices. In this paper, we introduce an online card tool containing questions to scaffold critical reflection about projects’ impacts on society, business, and research. We present the iterative design of the Responsible &amp; Inclusive Cards and findings from five workshops (n=21 participants) with teams distributed across a multinational technology corporation, as well as interviews with people with disabilities to assess gameplay and mental models. We found the tool promoted discussions about challenging topics, reduced power gaps through democratized turn-taking, and enabled participants to identify concrete areas to improve their practice.},

abstract = {Sharing multimedia content, without obtaining consent from the people involved causes multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs). However, social-media platforms do not proactively protect users from the occurrence of MPCs. Hence, users resort to out-of-band, informal communication channels, attempting to mitigate such conflicts. So far, previous works have focused on hard interventions that do not adequately consider the contextual factors (e.g., social norms, cognitive priming) or are employed too late (i.e., the content has already been seen). In this work, we investigate the potential of conversational agents as a medium for negotiating and mitigating MPCs. We designed MediationBot, a mediator chatbot that encourages consent collection, enables users to explain their points of view, and proposes solutions to finding a middle ground. We evaluated our design using a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with N = 32 participants, where we found that MediationBot can effectively help participants to reach an agreement and to prevent MPCs. It produced a structured conversation where participants had well-clarified speaking turns. Overall, our participants found MediationBot to be supportive as it proposes useful middle-ground solutions. Our work informs the future design of mediator agents to support social-media users against MPCs.},

Empathy refers to the ability to sense other people’s emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what they might be thinking and feeling. Architectural and urban design have identified empathy as a crucial factor in the design process and especially in user-centered participatory methods. Although empathy has been recognized as important for relating to other people’s issues, current research has not explored how urban accessibility issues elicit empathy. We conducted a between-subjects online study where 202 participants observed five scenarios on different accessibility issues. Our results show that empathic traits and previous experience are significant factors in empathizing with accessibility issues. Additionally, storytelling and photos can influence perceptions of accessibility issues. The study highlights the importance of empathic traits and personal experience in understanding and addressing accessibility issues, as well as the potential of storytelling and photos in shaping perceptions of accessibility issues and evoking empathy. Our contribution demonstrates the advantages of incorporating narrative multimedia into design processes for improved urban accessibility.},

This article examines perceptions of harm and preferences for remedies associated with online harassment with nearly 4000 participants in 14 countries around the world. The countries in this work reflect a range of identities and values, with a focus on those outside of North American and European contexts. Results show that perceptions of harm are higher among participants from all countries studied compared to the United States. Non-consensual sharing of sexual photos is consistently rated as harmful in all countries, while insults and rumors are perceived as more harmful in non-U.S. countries, especially harm to family reputation. Lower trust in other people and lower trust in sense of safety in one’s neighborhood correlate with increased perceptions of harm of online harassment. In terms of remedies, participants in most countries prefer monetary compensation, apologies, and publicly revealing offender’s identities compared to the U.S. Social media platform design and policy must consider regional values and norms, which may depart from U.S. centric-approaches.},

Hybrid work paradigms have simultaneously created new opportunities for PSAI, but have also fostered anxieties of misuse and privacy intrusions within a power asymmetry. At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.},

Unfortunately, both price and a lack of consideration of the needs of low-SES communities have made these devices inaccessible and unusable for communities that would most substantially benefit from their affordances. To address this gap and better understand how members of low-SES communities perceive the potential benefits and barriers to using wearable devices, we conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with people from minority, high crime rate, low-SES communities. Participants emphasized a critical need for safety-related wearable devices in their communities. Still, existing tools do not yet address the specific needs of this community and are out of reach due to several barriers. We distill themes on perceived useful features and ongoing obstacles to guide a much-needed research agenda we term ’Equityware’: building wearable devices based on low-SES communities’ needs, comfortability, and limitations.},

The images data conjure up, however, tend to be homogenous and flat: black screens, ones and zeros, big server farms in the desert. For designers and researchers who work with data as a material, this small repertoire can be stifling. For device users, it can lead to a removal of agency in how they make sense and engage with the data they produce. In this pictorial, we draw from a two-year data fictionalization project to start building an expanded repertoire of data imaginaries. We worked with seven households and seven writers to transform smart home data sets into fiction stories. Based on the interviews we conducted, we present the images participants shared with us as a step towards more expressive and varied imaginaries of data.},

Drawing on approaches within critical design and based on evidence from two different projects, we develop an approach, counterfactual actions, that moves beyond the creation of artifacts and towards more situated, embodied, and performative engagements. In one project, Reimaging Work, we used a participatory game to engage stakeholders from social and economic justice organizations in Chicago. The other project, Future Design Studio, invited audience members at a futurist festival to create artifacts from the future and then invited improvisational actors to build worlds around them. We argue that a focus on counterfactual actions supports a more relational approach to understanding the politics of socio-technical systems and infrastructures, allowing participants to gain a meaningful understanding of the ways in which technology could be designed otherwise in line with ethics, values and social justice concerns.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for flexible teaching formats, particularly online education, as an alternative to traditional face-to-face (F2F) education. This study investigates the impact of teaching format (online vs. F2F) on secondary school students’ interest and engagement. We conducted an exploratory analysis of survey data from 16 workshops (F2F: 12, online: 4) held between January and December 2022, with 129 participants completing the survey (F2F: 76, online: 53, age: 10-16). All workshops covered the same learning topics, provided by online courses developed to raise interest in computer science (CS). Our findings show that the teaching format had a negligible effect on interest development. Still, students in the F2F setting showed higher engagement levels than those in the online setting. Additionally, an analysis of the effect of age indicates that younger students are more engaged in online settings than their older peers. We also found indications for longer-running programs having a greater effect on personal interest development compared to one-day programs. This paper discusses the results and identifies implications for teaching practice and future research. Overall, the study highlights the need to balance the advantages and limitations of both teaching formats and suggests potential strategies to improve online engagement.},

abstract = {Accounting for technologies’ unintended consequences—whether they are misinformation on social media or issues of sustainability and social justice—increasingly requires HCI to consider technology design at a societal-level scale. At this scale, public and corporate policies play a critical role in shaping technologies and user behaviors. However, the research and practices around tech and policy design have largely been held separate. How can technology design and policies better inform and coordinate with each other in generating safe new technologies? What new solutions might emerge when HCI practitioners design technology and its policies simultaneously to account for its societal impacts? This workshop addresses these questions. It will 1) identify disciplines and areas of expertise needed for a tighter, more proactive technology-and-policy-design integration, 2) launch a community of researchers, educators, and designers interested in this integration, 3) identify and publish an HCI research and education agenda towards designing technologies and technology policies simultaneously.},

To engage farmers and citizens in supporting pollinating insects, we developed a participatory action in the shape of a “rural performance”, which revolved around the character of a Robot and his mission of monitoring biodiversity in hosting farms. As the story unfolded and farmers &amp; citizens actively took part in it, they were questioned about their idea of biodiversity and their relationships with pollinating insects. We suggest that the “rural performance” worked as a material deliberation method for citizens and farmers on the topic of pollination decline by situating a fictional robot and his speculative narrative in a real context where actual people could interact with and respond to him.},

Studies show that giving users outcome control by providing agency over how models’ predictions are incorporated into decision-making mitigates algorithm aversion. We study whether algorithm aversion is mitigated by process control, wherein users can decide what input factors and algorithms to use in model training. We conduct a replication study of outcome control, and test novel process control study conditions on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Prolific. Our results partly confirm prior findings on the mitigating effects of outcome control, while also forefronting reproducibility challenges. We find that process control in the form of choosing the training algorithm mitigates algorithm aversion, but changing inputs does not. Furthermore, giving users both outcome and process control does not reduce algorithm aversion more than outcome or process control alone. This study contributes to design considerations around mitigating algorithm aversion.},

In this paper, we contribute towards fabulation as an approach for design futuring that foregrounds feminist commitments and more-than-human concerns. Analyzing two fabulation case studies around biodata and bodily fluids, we offer three themes based on our process of developing these fabulations: how they engage materials, how they work to trouble temporalities, and how they cultivate imagination. We argue for the emerging potential of fabulation as an approach for open-ended, joyful design futuring, mobilizing speculative storytelling to foreground absent or neglected relations when imagining alternative lifeworlds.},

abstract = {With increasingly digitalized workplaces, the potential for sophisticated analyses of employee data rises. This increases the relevance of people analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees. Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply, employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits, demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study (n = 46) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then, we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively influence this consent decision. Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of potential risks is required when conceptualizing them.},

abstract = {Communication and collaboration are essential parts of the game development process. However, during the global pandemic, the shift to remote work marked a sudden change in how developers could communicate and collaborate with one another, as usual ad-hoc conversations that happen in physical offices were nonexistent. Based on a partnership grant study with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), this piece focuses on the results of a survey that examined developers' mental health and productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that most game developers want a hybrid or fully remote position even after pandemic conditions subside. Failure to address the pandemic's impact on the game development industry risks ignoring a rich area of technical communication complicated by, and responsive to, hybrid workplaces.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are the algorithms which select, filter, and personalize content across many of the world's largest platforms and apps. As such, their positive and negative effects on individuals and on societies have been extensively theorized and studied. Our overarching question is how to ensure that recommender systems enact the values of the individuals and societies that they serve. Addressing this question in a principled fashion requires technical knowledge of recommender design and operation, and also critically depends on insights from diverse fields including social science, ethics, economics, psychology, policy and law. This paper is a multidisciplinary effort to synthesize theory and practice from different perspectives, with the goal of providing a shared language, articulating current design approaches, and identifying open problems. We collect a set of values that seem most relevant to recommender systems operating across different domains, then examine them from the perspectives of current industry practice, measurement, product design, and policy approaches. Important open problems include multi-stakeholder processes for defining values and resolving trade-offs, better values-driven measurements, recommender controls that people use, non-behavioral algorithmic feedback, optimization for long-term outcomes, causal inference of recommender effects, academic-industry research collaborations, and interdisciplinary policy-making.},

Supporting efforts in finding alternatives to capitalism requires understanding the role of design in imagining alternative economic futures and reaching those most harmed by current capitalistic models. Through a collaboration between a community organization in Detroit and a team of university researchers, we hosted and facilitated a five-week workshop series with Black and Brown working-class Detroiters where they collectively imagined alternative economic futures using speculative design. They proposed Community Capitalism, Childcare Collectives, and Village-Based Childcare as alternative economy concepts from the workshops and described their unique characteristics and traits of love, care, and inclusion. Aligning with generative justice frameworks, Detroiters prioritized sustainable families and communities. We contribute an understanding of technology’s role in the imagined economic futures, a discussion of what this means for community-involved governance, and a push for centering Afrofuturism in speculative design approaches to foster futures literacy.},

The ongoing RtD project, called Turner Boxes, aims to design a technological network to interact with wild bees in an urban environment. The design choices negotiate challenges we encountered, including the potential effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on bee ecologies; sucrose feeding as an established human-bee interaction; and the question of human intervention when designing in relation to other species. We analyze our negotiations of these challenges along with the practices of beekeepers and ecologists who were part of our investigation, to realize that ambivalence is a characteristic and a resource in multispecies designing. We extend this analysis through feminist epistemologies to articulate a position of diffraction, a standpoint from which to design in multispecies worlds in which interdependencies and differences are critical.},

abstract = {With the heightened digitization of the workplace, alongside the rise of remote and hybrid work prompted by the pandemic, there is growing corporate interest in using passive sensing technologies for workplace wellbeing. Existing research on these technologies often focus on understanding or improving interactions between an individual user and the technology. Workplace settings can, however, introduce a range of complexities that challenge the potential impact and in-practice desirability of wellbeing sensing technologies. Today, there is an inadequate empirical understanding of how everyday workers---including those who are impacted by, and impact the deployment of workplace technologies--envision its broader socio-ecological impacts. In this study, we conduct storyboard-driven interviews with 33 participants across three stakeholder groups: organizational governors, AI builders, and worker data subjects. Overall, our findings surface how workers envisioned wellbeing sensing technologies may lead to cascading impacts on their broader organizational culture, interpersonal relationships with colleagues, and individual day-to-day lives. Participants anticipated harms arising from ambiguity and misalignment around scaled notions of "worker wellbeing,'' underlying technical limitations to workplace-situated sensing, and assumptions regarding how social structures and relationships may shape the impacts and use of these technologies. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing worker-centered data-driven wellbeing technologies.},

Our modest study seeks to prompt conversation about ethics and computing in the Global Souths and inform revisions to the ACM's curricular guidelines for the Society, Ethics and Professionalism knowledge area in undergraduate CS programs. Participants describe frictions between static and anticipatory approaches to ethics in globalised regulations and formal Codes of ethics and professional conduct, and local practices, values and impacts of technologies in the Global Souths. Codes and regulations are instruments for international control and their gap with local realities can cause harm, despite local efforts to compensate. However, our insights also illustrate opportunities for university teaching to link more closely to priorities, actions and experiences in the Global Souths and enrich students’ education in the Global North.},

Furthermore, we provide the parent-centered design opportunities and tensions we discovered for digital MCH in South African contexts, such as designing for local&nbsp;contexts and languages, designing for accessibility and connectedness, and highlighting the underdeveloped digital MCH niches. Finally, we highlight the importance of including facilitators for co-design workshops, such as using intermediaries and design cards.},

Perceptions of trust and credibility among chatbots have been attributed to the anthropomorphism and humanness of the chatbot design, with gender and race influencing their reception. Few existing studies have looked specifically at the diversity of chatbot avatar design related to both race, age, and gender, which may have particular significance for racially minoritized users like Black older adults. In this paper, we explored perceptions of chatbots with varying identities for health information seeking in a diary and interview study with 30 Black older adults. Our findings suggest that while racial and age likeness influence feelings of trust and comfort with chatbots, constructs such as professionalism and likeability and overall familiarity also influence reception. Based on these findings, we provide implications for designing text-based chatbots that consider Black older adults.},

This work focused on increasing this technology-mediated bodily understanding through exploring the material properties of the body rhythms that govern the sleep behaviours being tracked. Building from a workshop with non-normative sleepers, we reframe sleep tracking to be about understanding and manipulating body rhythms. We explore these rhythms through the RtD process of designing the Awari alertness-forecast and scheduling application in four iterations. This resulted in three non-exclusive categories of rhythmic influence: Slow &amp; Cyclical, Pressure &amp; Release, and Anchored. Through a better understanding of how they interact, their inertia, and their material properties for interaction we encourage the design of technology to shape, and be shaped, by the complex rhythms of life. We discuss ways in which this can democratise medical-models, and make actionable complex bodily processes.},

We report from interviews with 25 workers and 7 community leaders. Contrary to the modernist narratives around data and development, we find that data-driven systems invisibly inherited discriminatory properties from past institutions.

abstract = {Transparency matters a lot to people who experience moderation on online platforms; much CSCW research has viewed offering explanations as one of the primary solutions to enhance moderation transparency. However, relatively little attention has been paid to unpacking what transparency entails in moderation design, especially for content creators. We interviewed 28 YouTubers to understand their moderation experiences and analyze the dimensions of moderation transparency. We identified four primary dimensions: participants desired the moderation system to present moderation decisions saliently, explain the decisions profoundly, afford communication with the users effectively, and offer repairment and learning opportunities. We discuss how these four dimensions are mutually constitutive and conditioned in the context of creator moderation, where the target of governance mechanisms extends beyond the content to creator careers. We then elaborate on how a dynamic, transparency perspective could value content creators' digital labor, how transparency design could support creators' learning, as well as implications for transparency design of other creator platforms.},

abstract = {Computer science research has led to many breakthrough innovations but has also been scrutinized for enabling technology that has negative, unintended consequences for society. Given the increasing discussions of ethics in the news and among researchers, we interviewed 20 researchers in various CS sub-disciplines to identify whether and how they consider potential unintended consequences of their research innovations. We show that considering unintended consequences is generally seen as important but rarely practiced. Principal barriers are a lack of formal process and strategy as well as the academic practice that prioritizes fast progress and publications. Drawing on these findings, we discuss approaches to support researchers in routinely considering unintended consequences, from bringing diverse perspectives through community participation to increasing incentives to investigate potential consequences. We intend for our work to pave the way for routine explorations of the societal implications of technological innovations before, during, and after the research process.},

abstract = {Risk assessment algorithms are being adopted by public sector agencies to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. Algorithms model “risk” based on individual client characteristics to identify clients most in need. However, this understanding of risk is primarily based on easily quantifiable risk factors that present an incomplete and biased perspective of clients. We conducted a computational narrative analysis of child-welfare casenotes and draw attention to deeper systemic risk factors that are hard to quantify but directly impact families and street-level decision-making. We found that beyond individual risk factors, the system itself poses a significant amount of risk where parents are over-surveilled by caseworkers and lack agency in decision-making processes. We also problematize the notion of risk as a static construct by highlighting the temporality and mediating effects of different risk, protective, systemic, and procedural factors. Finally, we draw caution against using casenotes in NLP-based systems by unpacking their limitations and biases embedded within them.},

However, there is a lack of empirical research on computer-supported group work processes and their impact on outcomes at different stages of group work, especially when creativity and quality of outcomes are significant. Group work processes can interfere and hinder productivity, which we refer to as the “group folding effect.” We designed a three-stage process structuring to enhance group work productivity. In a field study, we examined how process structuring shapes productivity in two sub-studies: design and peer feedback, each with 40 participants (N = 40). The results revealed that process structuring significantly improved both the quantity and quality of productivity. Additionally, process structuring appeared to reduce inhibitory effects of group work, such as negative priming, fixation on familiar ideas, and social comparison. We discuss the implications of this research in supporting productive group work processes in collaborative tools and insights into a pattern of the group folding effect.},

However, current anthropographics tend to employ homogeneous human shapes to encode data about diverse demographic groups. Such anthropographics can obscure important differences between groups and contemporary designs exemplify the lack of inclusive approaches for representing human diversity in visualizations. In response, we explore the creation of demographically diverse anthropographics that communicate the visible diversity of demographically distinct populations. Building on previous anthropographics research, we explore strategies for visualizing datasets about people in ways that explicitly encode diversity—illustrating these approaches with examples in a variety of visual styles. We also critically reflect on strategies for creating diverse anthropographics, identifying social and technical challenges that can result in harmful representations. Finally, we highlight a set of forward-looking research opportunities for advancing the design and understanding of diverse anthropographics.},

We find that metaphors people use are contextually fluid, can change with the mode of conversation, and can reveal differences in how people perceive VUIs compared to other devices. Not all metaphors are helpful, and some may be offensive. Analyzing this broader class of metaphors can help understand, perhaps even predict problems. Metaphor analysis can be a low-cost tool to inspire design creativity and facilitate complex discussions about sociotechnical issues, enabling us to spot potential opportunities and problems in the situated use of technologies.},

We collected 62 projections from the literature and from a design workshop and found that 60% of them can be implemented using a table, a graph or a form. However, projections are often hardcoded for specific languages and situations, and in most cases only the developers of a code editor can create or adapt projections, leaving no room for appropriation by their users. We introduce lorgnette, a new framework for letting programmers augment their code editor with projections. We demonstrate five examples that use lorgnette to create projections that can be reused in new contexts. We discuss how this approach could help democratise projections and conclude with future work.},

However, it is unclear how this shift in collaboration has been received in professional UX practice, and whether new pain points have arisen. To this end, we conducted a survey (N = 114) with UX practitioners at software organizations based in the U.S. to better understand their collaborative practices and tools used throughout the design process. We found that while an increase in collaborative activity enhanced many aspects of UX work, some long-standing challenges—such as handing off designs to developers—still persist. Moreover, we observed new challenges emerging from activities enabled by collaborative tools such as design system management. Based on our findings, we discuss how UX practices can improve collaboration moving forward and provide concrete design implications for collaborative UX tools.},

abstract = {Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face daily challenges dealing with stress, for example, at work, or in public spaces, which can be overwhelming in terms of coping with sensory overload. Technological interventions have been created in order to attempt to counter symptoms of stress, through improving cognition and functioning of target users. Mobile devices, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications have demonstrated the ability to support and improve clinical practices through sensory based technologies. In this paper, we present the initial phase of research concerning an online survey conducted with over 200 autistic participants and caregivers. We report on the identification of currently used technological preferences, triggers associated with stress, issues regarding sensitivity and perception, the needs of caregivers, as well as the perceived potential for new technologies. The study has identified that sensitivity to sound and light remain key stress triggers for those on the autism spectrum. &nbsp;Headphones and mobile devices were considered to be suitable methods of&nbsp;accessing multi-sensory stimuli&nbsp;to help manage stress.&nbsp; Augmented Reality and VR were identified by autistic participants&nbsp;as technologies that might aid in the reduction of unpredictable stress-related events. The insights gained from the research will inform future research regarding the design of technological self-interventions for stress management in autistic adults.},

abstract = {Gender-blind design hinges upon an assumption that designing equally is the same as designing for equality. That, however, is inaccurate, as gender-blindness is merely a synonym for neutrality. Neutrality, because it lacks a concerted effort to subvert, favors hegemonic values and epistemologies, which counters the purported aim of equality. Supposedly objective methods of analysis, such as data gathering and interpreting, are not deprived of this hegemonic bias either. As such, through an acknowledgment of ethics, the designer must recognize that they are, indeed, imbuing their values into their designs, which bears influence on the ways in which the user interacts and interprets those designs, a notion which is especially relevant to a field concerned with user experience. This may be done deliberately or by accident, but it is always inevitable. Ethics is, in this way, inextricable from the design process, and, thus, the present article aims to propose that designing for equality requires the designer to act as an ethical agent — responsibly, consciously, and knowingly — especially if one hopes to avoid a design which embodies and communicates oppressive notions. In particular, within the purview of ethics, and by making use of some case-studies and examples, it argues that designing toward gender equality requires not the more typical gender-blind approach, but rather one which is specifically gender-conscious. Further, this article also offers some suggestions as to how we might begin to act as ethical design agents and implement marginalized epistemologies into the design process.},

We show how different stakeholders negotiate the definition of problems to be addressed with social media data, the collective creation of ground-truth, and the limitations involved in the process of extracting value from data. The meanings of social media data are not defined in advance; instead, they are contingent on the practices and needs of the organization that seeks to extract insights from the analysis.

abstract = {Restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected people's opportunities to engage in activities that are meaningful to their lives. In response to these constraints, many people, including older adults, turned to digital technologies as alternative ways to pursue meaningful activities. These technology-mediated activities, however, presented new challenges for older adults’ everyday use of technology. In this paper, we investigate how older adults used digital technologies for meaningful activities during COVID-19 restrictions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 older adults and analyzed the interview data through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT). Our analysis shows that using digital technologies for meaningful activities can both support and undermine older people's three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We argue that future technologies should be designed to empower older adults’ content creation, engagement in personal interests, exploration of technology, effortful communication, and participation in beneficent activities.},

abstract = {Sled dogs have performed vital services to mankind throughout history, transporting people, goods, mail, food, and medicines. Today, sled dog teams still provide transportation as well as sport, such as the famous Iditarod race. Studies show that of the 38% of dogs which drop out of long distance sled races, 51% drop due to orthopedic injuries. Sled dog mushers have limited ways of quantifying their dog’s health while training and racing, mostly relying on visual observation. According to Iditarod mushers and veterinarians, the easiest way to detect injuries in sled dogs is through analysis of pull force and gait. We created a Wearable Activity and Gait Detection (WAG’D) monitor in an effort to identify early signs of gait and pull force changes, with the intent of reducing the number of injuries in sled dog racing. We sought to identify requirements for a wearable sled dog monitor and build a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate proof-of-concept. The WAG’D monitor may also prove useful for other canine athletes, such as those who participate in Canicross or Bikejoring. A gait detection monitor may also have important applications for veterinarians for lameness detection. We evaluated the prototype’s functionality and received feedback through semi-structured interviews with 5 Canicross athletes and 2 Bikejorers in Georgia USA as well one Iditarod musher in Alaska USA. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the WAG’D wearable computing device which can collect inertial and pull force data in-situ during field studies.},

In this work, we aim to understand impacted stakeholders’ perspectives on a deployed ADS that prioritizes scarce housing resources. We employed AI lifecycle comicboarding, an adapted version of the comicboarding method, to elicit stakeholder feedback and design ideas across various components of an AI system’s design. We elicited feedback from county workers who operate the ADS daily, service providers whose work is directly impacted by the ADS, and unhoused individuals in the region. Our participants shared concerns and design suggestions around the AI system’s overall objective, specific model design choices, dataset selection, and use in deployment. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders, even without AI knowledge, can provide specific and critical feedback on an AI system’s design and deployment, if empowered to do so.},

These challenges were categorized into three main themes: Processes and practices, Teams, and Organizational-level challenges in LSAD. By recognizing and addressing these challenges, projects operating in similar contexts can synchronize their activities and harness the advantages of agile methodologies at a large scale.

New norms for routine management have emerged during the current pandemic, and in particular, individuals with autism find it difficult to adapt to those norms. While much research has focused on the use of computer technology to support individuals with autism, little is known about ways of helping them establish and maintain “self-directed” routine structures. In this paper, we identify design requirements for an app that support four key routine components (i.e., physical activity, diet, mindfulness, and sleep) through a formative study and develop RoutineAid, a gamified smartphone app that reflects the design requirements. The results of a two-month field study on design feasibility highlight two affordances of RoutineAid—the establishment of daily routines by facilitating micro-planning and the maintenance of daily routines through celebratory interactions. We discuss salient design considerations for the future development of daily routine management tools for individuals with autism.},

abstract = {In a human-AI co-creation, AI not only categorizes, evaluates and interprets data but also generates new content and interacts with humans. As co-creative AI is a form of intelligent technology that directly involves humans, it is critical to anticipate and address ethical issues during all design stages. The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore several ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using a design fiction (DF) methodology. DF is a speculative research method that depicts a new concept or technology through stories as an intangible prototype. We present the findings from the study as potential users’ perspectives, stances, and expectations around ethical challenges in human-AI co-creativity as a basis for designing human-centered ethical AI partners for human-AI co-creation.},

abstract = {Amidst calls for public accountability over large data-driven systems, feminist and indigenous scholars have developed refusal as a practice that challenges the authority of data collectors. However, because data affects so many aspects of daily life, it can be hard to see seemingly different refusal strategies as part of the same repertoire. Furthermore, conversations about refusal often happen from the standpoint of designers and policymakers rather than the people and communities most affected by data collection. In this paper, we introduce a framework for data refusal from below—writing from the standpoint of people who refuse, rather than the institutions that seek their compliance. Because refusers work to reshape socio-technical systems, we argue that refusal is an act of design, and that design-based frameworks and methods can contribute to refusal. We characterize refusal strategies across four constituent facets common to all refusal, whatever strategies are used: autonomy, or how refusal accounts for individual and collective interests; time, or whether refusal reacts to past harm or proactively prevents future harm; power, or the extent to which refusal makes change possible; and cost, or whether or not refusal can reduce or redistribute penalties experienced by refusers. We illustrate each facet by drawing on cases of people and collectives that have refused data systems. Together, the four facets of our framework are designed to help scholars and activists describe, evaluate, and imagine new forms of refusal.},

Through a systematic review of autonomy-supportive designs within HCI research, this paper makes three contributions: a landscape overview of the existing conceptualisation of Digital Autonomy for children within HCI; a framework of 12 distinct design mechanisms for supporting children’s digital autonomy, clustered into 5 categories by their common mechanisms; and an identification of 5 critical design considerations for future support of children’s digital autonomy. Our findings provide a critical understanding of current support for children’s digital autonomy in HCI. We highlight the importance of considering children’s digital autonomy from multi-perspectives and suggest critical factors and gaps to be considered for future autonomy-supportive designs.},

However, several questions around employment classification, compensation, data privacy, and equitable outcomes remain open. The abilities of algorithmic management to structure different forms of platform-worker relationships compounds fraught regulatory debates. Understanding the conditions of algorithmic management that result in these variations could point us towards better worker futures. In this work, we studied the platform-worker relationships in Instacart work through the accounts of its workers. From a qualitative analysis of 400 Reddit posts by Instacart’s workers, we identified sources and types of ambiguity that gave rise to open-ended experiences for workers. Ambiguities supplemented gamification mechanisms to regulate worker behaviors. Yet, they also generated affective experiences for workers that enabled their playful participation in the Reddit community. We propose the frame of&nbsp;ludification to explain these seemingly contradicting findings and conclude with implications for accountability in on-demand work platforms.},

Nevertheless, an integrated and systemic theory that can explain what makes some Scrum teams more effective than others is still missing. To address this gap, we performed a 7-year-long mixed-methods investigation composed of two main phases. First, we induced a theoretical model from 13 exploratory field studies. Our model proposes that the effectiveness of Scrum teams depends on five high-level factors (responsiveness, stakeholder concern, continuous improvement, team autonomy, and management support) and 13 lower-level factors. In the second phase of our study, we validated our model with a covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis using data from about 5,000 developers and 2,000 Scrum teams that we gathered with a custom-built survey. Results suggest a very good fit of the empirical data in our theoretical model (CFI = 0.959, RMSEA = 0.038, SRMR = 0.035). Accordingly, this research allowed us to (1) propose and validate a generalizable theory for effective Scrum teams and (2) formulate clear recommendations for how organizations can better support Scrum teams.},

Codestrates builds on top of Webstrates and adds an authoring environment, which blurs the use and development of applications. Grounded in a chronology of the development of Webstrates and Codestrates, we present eight tensions that we needed to balance during their development. We use these tensions as an analytical lens in three case studies and a game challenge in which participants created games using Codestrates. We discuss the results of the game challenge based on these tensions and present key takeaways for six of them. Finally, we present six lessons learned from our endeavor to realize the vision of computational media, demonstrating the balancing act of weighing the vision against the pragmatics of implementing a working system.},

Barriers such as desire discrepancy, lack of communication, changing needs, and habituality interfere with sexual desire and relationship satisfaction. This paper explores whether technology has a role in supporting and increasing sexual desire or developing an understanding of different individual needs towards sexual desire within couples’ relationships and how it can do so. To explore this, we conducted a survey (n=77) and interview study (n=12). Results show that participants wanted a shared, dedicated, and protected space to playfully explore their individual desire with each other. They felt technology could facilitate a better understanding of their evolving needs as a couple, motivate open sexual communication, bring spontaneity, and hands-on exploration; however, technology should not inflict judgement or obligations on desire levels; it should help to understand and situate differing needs in a relationship meaningfully. We share our reflections on the role of technology and raise important considerations in such technology design.},

We find that TikTok’s community structure is permeable, allowing for self-discovery and understanding not found in traditional online communities. However, participants are wary of mental health information due to conflicts between a creator’s vulnerability and credibility. Our interviews suggest that the “For You Page" is a runaway train that encourages diverse community and content engagement but also displays harmful content that participants feel they cannot escape.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 blind visual arts patrons to understand how they engage with visual artwork and the factors that influence their adoption of visual arts access methods. We further examined interview insights in a follow-up survey (N=220). We present: 1) current practices and challenges of accessing visual artwork in-person and online (e.g., Zoom tour), 2) motivation and cognition of perceiving visual arts (e.g., imagination), and 3) implications for designing visual arts access methods. Overall, our findings provide a roadmap for technology-based support for blind people’s visual arts experiences.},

abstract = {Objectives. The goal of this paper is to introduce and describe a new introductory computer science course. Research results from the implementation of this curriculum will be presented to demonstrate the nature of teachers’ experiences with the curriculum.Participants. Participants are teachers implementing the new curriculum at two schools in the metro Atlanta area.Study Method. This paper is partly descriptive, presenting the theory underlying the newly developed curriculum as well as its various features. An organizing framework, the Teacher Accessibility, Equity, and Content (TEC) rubric from Weintrop et al. (2019) [1], is used to structure the curriculum description. Teacher perceptions were gathered via both structured interviews and short online enactment surveys. These perceptions are summarized and presented thematically, corresponding to the features of the curriculum.Findings. A newly developed introductory computer science (CS) curriculum, Student-Centered Computing (SCC), utilizes project-based learning (PBL) and culturally authentic practices (CAPs) to help promote a sense of belonging and intent to persist within computer science among all students. Teachers successfully implemented the curriculum and generally found it to be beneficial for their students, though they struggled with some of the pedagogical demands of project-based learning as well as some of the most advanced technical content associated with the music coding and app development platforms.Conclusions. This paper provides a detailed overview of a year-long introductory computer science curriculum focused on the creation of culturally relevant digital artifacts. The curriculum represents a strong effort to make CS content relevant and appealing to the full range of students by relating it to their lives and experiences. Teacher surveys and interviews revealed that both teachers and students had positive views of the course. However, teaching using inclusive PBL pedagogy and culturally authentic practices takes skill and practice by teachers, supporting the need for CS teachers to have good pedagogical training as well as a strong knowledge of computer science to create a classroom environment that promotes success for all students.},

abstract = {Humans easily miss events in their surroundings due to limited short-term memory and field of view. This happens, for example, while watching an instructor's machine repair demonstration or conversing during a sports game. We present RealityReplay, a novel Mixed Reality (MR) approach that tracks and visualizes these significant events using in-situ MR visualizations without modifying the physical space. It requires only a head-mounted MR display and a 360-degree camera. We contribute a method for egocentric tracking of important motion events in users' surroundings based on a combination of semantic segmentation and saliency prediction, and generating in-situ MR visual summaries of temporal changes. These summary visualizations are overlaid onto the physical world to reveal which objects moved, in what order, and their trajectory, enabling users to observe previously hidden events. The visualizations are informed by a formative study comparing different styles on their effects on users' perception of temporal changes. Our evaluation shows that RealityReplay significantly enhances sensemaking of temporal motion events compared to memory-based recall. We demonstrate application scenarios in guidance, education, and observation, and discuss implications for extending human spatiotemporal capabilities through technological augmentation.},

Informed by the work of philosopher Anne-Fran\c{c}oise Schmid, we introduce the concept of the integrative object as a means to reorient interdisciplinary collaboration toward the requirements of the object of research itself, rather than via the requirements of particular disciplinary languages, methods, or operative logics. We show how such an approach is useful for research into sociotechnical phenomena that exceed the boundaries of discrete disciplines and their convergence. We introduce digital well-being as a case study, drawing on the authors’ own interdisciplinary collaborative experiences in this area as its empirical matter. From this, and in order to aid future research into similarly complex sociotechnical objects, we then provide practical tools to help those in the HCI community prepare and conduct interdisciplinary research in a similarly generative, non-dogmatic, and non-hierarchical manner.},

We have open-sourced the resulting voice, along with the process and data used to create it. Finally, we present results from a large-scale survey showing that non-binary individuals are more likely to prefer a non-binary voice assistant compared to cisgendered individuals and discuss differences across age and gender.},

We quantify how the CHI literature might have changed in these three aspects by analyzing samples of 118 CHI 2017 and 127 CHI 2022 papers—randomly drawn and stratified across conference sessions. We operationalized research ethics, openness, and transparency into 45&nbsp; criteria and manually annotated the sampled papers. The results show that the CHI 2022 sample was better in 18 criteria, but in the rest of the criteria, it has no improvement. The most noticeable improvements were related to research transparency (10 out of 17 criteria). We also explored the possibility of assisting the verification process by developing a proof-of-concept screening system. We tested this tool with eight criteria. Six of them achieved high accuracy and F1 score. We discuss the implications for future research practices and education.

In this paper, I identify the sociotechnical futures that Amazon-one of the big tech companies-envisions and the future of work that the company is moving toward. I explore the future of fulfillment centers through an analysis of the patents on fulfillment center technologies which Amazon may turn into reality one day. In my analysis, I focus on humans by asking how they are configured in the future of fulfillment centers and, more specifically, how Amazon envisions the role of human labor within work automation and AI systems. The analysis reveals where and how humans are expected to "step in" to operate the future of fulfillment centers. I discuss my findings within and beyond CSCW, highlighting the importance of studying tech companies' imaginaries. I argue that by understanding tech companies' imaginaries, it becomes possible for us to launch effective sociotechnical interventions to negotiate or even resist their specific imaginaries and/or design ways for a more democratic uptake of companies' future technologies. Finally, I articulate practical ways in which patents can be utilized in CSCW research.},

abstract = {End-to-end encryption in popular messaging applications relies on centralized key servers. To keep these honest, users are supposed to meet in person and compare “fingerprints” of their public keys. Very few people do this, despite attempts to make this process more usable, making trust in the systems tenuous. To encourage broader adoption of verification behaviors, this paper proposes a new type of authentication ceremony, incidental incremental in-band fingerprint verification (I3FV), in which users periodically share with their friends photos or videos of themselves responding to simple visual or behavioral prompts (“challenges”). This strategy allows verification to be performed incidentally to normal user activities, incrementally over time, and in-band within the messaging application. By replacing a dedicated security task with a fun, already-widespread activity, I3FV has the potential to vastly increase the number of people verifying keys and therefore strengthen trust in encrypted messaging.},

It integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. We hypothesize that point clouds are well suited for prototyping, as they can be captured more rapidly than textured meshes and then edited immediately in situ on the capturing device. We based the design of PointShopAR on the practical needs of six architects in a formative study. Our system supports a variety of point cloud editing operations in AR, including selection, transformation, hole filling, drawing, morphing, and animation. We evaluate PointShopAR through a remote study on usability and an in-person study on environmental design support. Participants were able to iterate design rapidly, showing the merits of an integrated capture and editing workflow with point clouds in AR environmental design.},

It is subject to diverse and idiosyncratic approaches to the artistic practice that it is situated. We investigated this by joining a dance company to develop interactive technologies for a new performance. From our firsthand account, we show the design space to be messy and non-linear, demanding flexibility and negotiation between multiple stakeholders and constraints. Through interviews with performers and choreographers, we identified nine themes for incorporating technology into dance, revealing tensions and anxiety, but also evolution and improvised processes to weave complex layers into a finished work. We find design for dance productions to be resistant to formal interpretation, requiring designers to embrace the intertwining stages, steps, and methods of the artistic processes that generate them. We suggest that our findings can be of value in other HCI contexts requiring flexible design approaches.},

We propose the Newcomer Homepage, a central place where newcomers can learn how peer production works and find opportunities to contribute, as a solution for attracting and retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon existing research and designed in collaboration with partner communities. Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27 non-English Wikipedia wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find modest gains, and that having a positive effect on the newcomer experience depends on the newcomer's context. We discuss how this impacts interventions that aim to improve the newcomer experience in peer production communities.},
