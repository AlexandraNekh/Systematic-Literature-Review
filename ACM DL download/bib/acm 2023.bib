abstract = {This first workshop on explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts) brings together a community of researchers and creative practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interaction Design, AI, explainable AI (XAI), and Digital Arts to explore the role of XAI for the Arts. XAI is a core concern of Human-Centred AI and relies heavily on HCI techniques to explore how complex and difficult to understand AI models such as deep learning techniques can be made more understandable to people. However, XAI research has primarily focused on work-oriented and task-oriented explanations of AI and there has been little research on XAI for creative domains such as the Arts. This workshop will: i) build an XAIxArts research community; ii) map out the current and future possible landscapes of XAIxArts; iii) critically reflect on the potential of XAI for the Arts, forming the basis for an edited book on XAIxArts and an international network of researchers.},

abstract = {Technologies based on AI/ML are playing an increasingly prominent role in teenagers’ everyday lives. Mirroring this trend is a concomitant interest in teaching young people about intelligent technologies. Whereas previous research in the field of Child–Computer Interaction has proposed curriculum and learning activities that describe what teenagers need to learn about AI/ML, there is still a shortage of studies which specifically address teenager-centered perspectives in the teaching of AI/ML. This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

abstract = {Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component of AI-driven interactive systems. With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI also becomes essential in AR because end-users will frequently interact with intelligent services. However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses when, what, and how to provide explanations of AI output in AR. The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users’ preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. XAIR’s utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users. XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.},

abstract = {Explainable AI (XAI) systems are sociotechnical in nature; thus, they are subject to the sociotechnical gap-divide between the technical affordances and the social needs. However, charting this gap is challenging. In the context of XAI, we argue that charting the gap improves our problem understanding, which can reflexively provide actionable insights to improve explainability. Utilizing two case studies in distinct domains, we empirically derive a framework that facilitates systematic charting of the sociotechnical gap by connecting AI guidelines in the context of XAI and elucidating how to use them to address the gap. We apply the framework to a third case in a new domain, showcasing its affordances. Finally, we discuss conceptual implications of the framework, share practical considerations in its operationalization, and offer guidance on transferring it to new contexts. By making conceptual and practical contributions to understanding the sociotechnical gap in XAI, the framework expands the XAI design space.},

abstract = {eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models, and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique, and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback, with a two-fold outcome: first, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users’ trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so that we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.},

When fiduciary organizations interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests, and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment. Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data subject’s consent when interacting with complex technical systems.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) must increasingly be able to serve various global contexts. Overall, a fundamental need has been identified in the PD community to raise previously unheard global voices in design and development work, and to bring various underrepresented stakeholders together. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of various synchronous and asynchronous communication methods through collaborative online tools offers opportunities for more dispersed and more diverse PD research teams, settings and processes. This raises new possibilities for bridging global distances and bringing various stakeholders together for the purposes of conducting multicultural, multi-site PD. Importantly, while there exists extensive research literatures both on PD, on remote ethnography and on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, we posit that these literatures have not been brought together; nor have the practices and methodologies of these communities been sufficiently jointly explored to support the goals of multisite, multicultural PD. In this workshop, we strive to bridge this gap in knowledge through exploring the opportunities of conducting hybrid multi-site Participatory Design (HMPD) research through synchronous and asynchronous present–telepresent participatory methods, and to share issues, challenges, opportunities, methods and empirical examples pertaining to this as a goal.},

abstract = {With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainable work, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.},

Drawing from existing literature in M/D/OH, we present a series of imaginary method abstracts that prompt questions for researchers to reflect on as they adapt PD techniques for new, different contexts. We highlight three value tensions—authenticity, reciprocity, and impact—integral to sustaining a concern for responsibility in PD scholarship. We end with reflections and potential considerations for responsibly applying PD and design fiction methods in M/D/OH settings.},

We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.},

Because of this complexity, governing technology and data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability has proven to be a difficult task that –according to experts– requires a systems perspective in its design and implementation. In this paper, we take a conceptual approach to respond to this call from experts by providing working definitions of both enterprise data governance and a systems approach to management. Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential trade-offs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government. Simulation experiments suggest that an emphasis on governance of IT may create a strong foundation for the development of AI capability.},

abstract = {Machine intelligence relies on Al (artificial intelligence) trainers, workers who perform labor such as data annotation and algorithm optimization. However, the promise of Al does not often benefit workers equally; instead, it puts them in precarious situations, such as low wages and subordination to machines. My dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to draw attention to these pressing issues by exploring the sociotechnical, cultural, and economic dimensions of this emergent technology-mediated labor in the context of large data infrastructures. My arguments and proposed concepts (e.g., sociotechnical/algorithmic mobility) respond directly to the under-theorization of mobility research and ecologically unequal exchange theory in HCI. In my dissertation, I argue that the Al trainers, who often work in developing regions of western China, are shouldering the burdens of (1) alleviating China’s poverty through Al for development programs, (2) sustaining Eastern China’s platform economy as key participants in large-scale data infrastructure projects, and (3) promoting global Al advancement by providing disembodied labor on products such as high-quality training datasets through repetitive and low-paying work. Using multi-sited ethnography and participatory design methods, my dissertation describes the experiences of under-resourced and under-studied Al trainer communities and the effects of AI on them. It will also offer context-sensitive design recommendations for supporting emergent technology-mediated labor and policy interventions for ethical and sustainable Al training practices.},

Despite their success in research, healthcare, or education, LLMs frequently include incorrect information, called hallucinations, in their responses. These hallucinations could influence users to trust fake news or change their general beliefs. Therefore, we investigate mitigation strategies desired by users to enable identification of LLM hallucinations. To achieve this goal, we conduct a participatory design study where everyday users design interface features which are then assessed for their feasibility by machine learning (ML) experts. We find that many of the desired features are well-perceived by ML experts but are also considered as difficult to implement. Finally, we provide a list of desired features that should serve as a basis for mitigating the effect of LLM hallucinations on users.},

In this paper, we introduce the “AI story relay,” a method by which the AI developer and users collaboratively construct a design fiction in a relay for AI design considerations. To explore the method’s potential that encourages communication between AI developers and users, we conducted a case study of an AI-based coaching service. We expect AI story relay to contribute to fostering a dynamic exchange of views between developers and prospective users.},

abstract = {Governments, businesses, and researchers are paying increased attention to the application of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) [7]. AIEd technologies pose potential challenges to privacy, equity, and intellectual property, as seen with the early effects of OpenAI's Chat-GPT in education. However, current AIEd research fails to evaluate existing policy through a holistic view of the development and design process. We use Chen and Ahn's process governance framework [4] to analyze current United States federal documents about the intersection of AI and education. BERT aids our analysis by quantifying sentence similarity between the documents and the process framework. We recommend that legislators focus on public values during goal-setting and student involvement throughout the process.},

abstract = {Secondary school physical education (PE) teachers are continuously challenged to find ways to support students learning and motivate them for an active and healthy lifestyle. To address this complexity, continuing teacher professional development (TPD) is key. Technological tools can facilitate the effective delivery of TPD in this context. Successful implementation of this technology, however, is not self-evident. Based on the general aim of effectively integrating technologies in the educational process and focusing on the needs of educators, this study examines how the evidence-based theoretical TARGET framework for creating a motivating PE learning climate might be embedded into a digital professional development tool for PE teachers, useful in everyday practice. It presents a case study in which a multidisciplinary team of researchers, designers, and end-users iteratively went through several phases of need identification, idea generation, designing, development, and testing. By using a participatory approach, we were able to collect contextualized data and gain insights into users’ preferences, requirements, and ideas for designing and engaging with the tool. Based on these insights the TPD TARGET-tool for PE teachers was ultimately developed. The most prominent characteristics of this tool are (1) the combination of an evaluative function with teaching strategy support, (2) the strong emphasis on ease of use due to the complex PE teaching context, (3) the avoidance of social comparison, and suggestions of normative judgment, and (4) the allowance for a high level of customization and teacher autonomy.},

abstract = {The paramount measure of success for a machine learning model has historically been predictive power and accuracy, but even a gold-standard accuracy benchmark fails when it inappropriately misrepresents a disabled or minority body. In this work, we reframe the role of machine learning as a provocation through a case study of participatory work co-creating exergames by employing machine learning and its training as a source of play and motivation rather than an accurate diagnostic tool for children with and without Sensory Based Motor Disorder. We created a design probe, Cirkus, that supports nearly any aminal locomotion exergame while collecting movement data for training a bespoke machine learning model. During 5 participatory workshops with a total of 30 children using Cirkus, we co-created a catalog of 17 exergames and a resulting machine-learning model. We discuss the potential implications of reframing machine learning’s role in Assistive Technology for values other than accuracy, share the challenges of using “messy” movement data from children with disabilities in an ever-changing co-creation context for training machine learning, and present broader implications of using machine learning in therapy games.},

abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated / human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically-generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically-generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

abstract = {Virtual humans (VHs) have the potential to support mental wellness among college computer science (CS) students. However, designing effective VHs for counseling purposes requires a clear understanding of students’ demographics, backgrounds, and expectations. To this end, we conducted two user studies with 216 CS students from a major university in North America. In the first study, we explored how students co-designed VHs to support mental wellness conversations and found that the VHs’ demographics, appearance, and voice closely resembled the characteristics of their designers. In the second study, we investigated how the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacted the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward gratitude journaling. Our findings suggest that the active participation of CS students in VH design leads to the creation of agents that closely resemble their designers. Moreover, we found that the interplay between the VH’s appearance and voice impacts the agent’s effectiveness in promoting CS students’ intentions toward mental wellness techniques.},

In this paper, we introduce and formalise a process for collecting a FeedbackLog. We also provide concrete use cases where FeedbackLogs can be employed as evidence for algorithmic auditing and as a tool to record updates based on stakeholder feedback.},

From interviews with 24 students in the UK who had moved away from their childhood homes, we used sensemaking literature to frame the process of initial disruption to the rebuilding of self-care practices around a new lifestyle and support networks. By studying a significant life transition, we uncover implications for the design of T1D technology, particularly closed-loop systems, through AI enhancements and human-centred design approaches, then extrapolate for other significant life transitions and chronic conditions.},

The system was designed to enable social interaction between multiple wearers, such as an exchange of arm(s), and explore possible interactions between digital cyborgs in a cyborg society. This paper describes the JIZAI ARMS’ design process, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human augmentation researchers, product designers, a system architect, and manufacturers, to realize a technically complex system while considering the aesthetics of a digital cyborg. We also provide an autobiographical report of our first impressions of using the JIZAI ARMS and use our findings to speculate on a model of potential social interactions between digital cyborgs.},

Unhoused persons are vulnerable and using their data in the ML pipeline raises serious concerns about the unintended harms and consequences of prioritizing different ML values. To address this, we conducted a critical analysis of 40 research papers identified through a systematic literature review in ML homelessness service provision research. We found that the values of novelty, performance, and identifying limitations were uplifted in these papers, whereas (in)efficiency, (low/high) cost, fast, (violated) privacy, and (homeless condition) reproducibility valuescollapse. Consequently, unhoused persons were lost (i.e., humans were deprioritized) at multi-level ML abstraction of predictors, categories, and algorithms. Our findings illuminate potential pathways forward at the intersection of data science, HCI and STS by situating humans at the center to support this vulnerable community.},

For researchers and practitioners who are interested in taking a participatory approach to AI design and development, it remains challenging to assess the extent to which any participatory approach grants substantive agency to stakeholders. This article thus aims to ground what we dub the “participatory turn” in AI design by synthesizing existing theoretical literature on participation and through empirical investigation and critique of its current practices. Specifically, we derive a conceptual framework through synthesis of literature across technology design, political theory, and the social sciences that researchers and practitioners can leverage to evaluate approaches to participation in AI design. Additionally, we articulate empirical findings concerning the current state of participatory practice in AI design based on an analysis of recently published research and semi-structured interviews with 12 AI researchers and practitioners. We use these empirical findings to understand the current state of participatory practice and subsequently provide guidance to better align participatory goals and methods in a way that accounts for practical constraints.},

abstract = {Getting training data for machine learning (ML) prediction of mental illness on social media data is labor intensive. To work around this, ML teams will extrapolate proxy signals, or alternative signs from data to evaluate illness status and create training datasets. However, these signals' validity has not been determined, whether signals align with important contextual factors, and how proxy quality impacts downstream model integrity. We use ML and qualitative methods to evaluate whether a popular proxy signal, diagnostic self-disclosure, produces a conceptually sound ML model of mental illness. Our findings identify major conceptual errors only seen through a qualitative investigation -- training data built from diagnostic disclosures encodes a narrow vision of diagnosis experiences that propagates into paradoxes in the downstream ML model. This gap is obscured by strong performance of the ML classifier (F1 = 0.91). We discuss the implications of conceptual gaps in creating training data for human-centered models, and make suggestions for improving research methods.},

We explore the process of designing Future Machine – the provenance and sustainability of the materials, the participatory design process, how Future Machine's interactivity is evolving over time and how the technology might be sustained for 30 years. We investigate the role that Future Machine plays in engaging the human populations across these diverse places, exploring how the artists used strategies of entanglement and myth-making to support the interactions between the ecologies, technologies, non-human inhabitants, narratives and neighbourly relations that are emerging as the project evolves over time. In conclusion we propose that the artist strategies of entanglement and encouraging myth-making reveal new approaches to experiential design. We propose that these strategies provide opportunities to open up a set of disruptive/radical/novel design challenges for HCI, that encourage sustainable and positive forms of interactions for a world increasingly impacted by anthropogenic climate and environmental change},

We present a co-design study investigating the benefits and challenges of using computational notebooks to inform ML models with end user groups. We used a computational notebook to engage young adults, carers, and clinicians with an example ML model that predicted health risk in diabetes care. Through co-design workshops and retrospective interviews, we found that participants particularly valued using the interactive data visualisations of the computational notebook to scaffold multidisciplinary learning, anticipate benefits and harms of the example ML model, and create fictional feature importance plots to highlight care needs. Participants also reported challenges, from running code cells to managing information asymmetries and power imbalances. We discuss the potential of leveraging computational notebooks as interactive co-design tools to meet end user needs early in ML model lifecycles.},

Different stakeholders of an AI system&nbsp;(e.g. managers, developers, auditors, etc.) may have different background knowledge, competencies and goals, thus requiring different kinds of interpretations and explanations. Fortunately, there is a growing armoury of tools to interpret ML models and explain their predictions, recommendations and diagnoses which we will refer to collectively as explanation strategies. As these explanation strategies mature, practitioners will gain experience that helps them know which strategies to deploy in different circumstances. What is lacking, and is addressed by iSee, is capturing, sharing and re-using explanation strategies based on past positive experiences. The goal of the iSee platform is to improve every user’s experience of AI, by harnessing experiences and best practices in Explainable AI.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains comes with both high expectations of its benefits and dire predictions of misuse. While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children. Based on a thematic analysis, we present four themes — Technology as Utility and Authority, Individual and Collective Place-Making, Staged and Emerging Conflicts, Belonging to the Group and Self-Expression — which we use to inform three design directions for developing DivComp Spaces specifically in the context of school. Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.},

abstract = {As robots become increasingly prevalent in our communities, aligning the values motivating their behavior with human values is critical. However, it is often difficult or impossible for humans, both expert and non-expert, to enumerate values comprehensively, accurately, and in forms that are readily usable for robot planning. Misspecification can lead to undesired, inefficient, or even dangerous behavior. In the value alignment problem, humans and robots work together to optimize human objectives, which are often represented as reward functions and which the robot can infer by observing human actions. In existing alignment approaches, no explicit feedback about this inference process is provided to the human. In this paper, we introduce an exploratory framework to address this problem, which we call Transparent Value Alignment (TVA). TVA suggests that techniques from explainable AI (XAI) be explicitly applied to provide humans with information about the robot's beliefs throughout learning, enabling efficient and effective human feedback.},

We investigate the use of interactive machine learning techniques to mitigate such errors. Results from statistical analyses indicate that a deep learning model based on interactive machine learning can significantly reduce the number of technological errors in a set of musical performance tasks with the mixed reality musical instrument. Based on our findings, we argue that the application of interactive machine learning techniques can be beneficial for embodied, hand-controlled musical instruments in the mixed reality domain.},

It is uniquely difficult to introduce clinician-facing ML-based systems in practice, which has been recognised in HCI and related fields. Recent publications have begun to address the sociotechnical challenges of designing, developing, and successfully deploying clinician-facing ML-based systems. We conducted a qualitative systematic review and provided answers to the question: “How can HCI researchers and practitioners contribute to the successful realisation of ML in medical practice?” We reviewed 25 eligible papers that investigated the real-world clinical implications of concrete clinician-facing ML-based systems. The main contributions of this systematic review are: (1) an overview of the technical aspects of ML innovation and their consequences for HCI researchers and practitioners; (2) a description of the different roles that ML-based systems can take in clinical settings; (3) a conceptualisation of the main activities of medical ML innovation processes; (4) identification of five sociotechnical interdependencies that emerge from medical ML innovation; and (5) implications for HCI researchers and practitioners on how to mitigate the sociotechnical challenges of medical ML innovation.},

abstract = {In 2021, the National Institute of Justice — the research arm of the United States Department of Justice — released the “Recidivism Forecasting Challenge” (“the Challenge”) with the stated goals of “increas[ing] public safety and improv[ing] the fair administration of justice across the United States,” providing “critical information to community corrections departments...,” and ultimately “improv[ing]” the ability to forecast recidivism using person-and place-based variables” [68]. The Challenge was also designed, in part, to encourage “non-criminal justice forecasting researchers to compete against more ‘traditional’ criminal justice researchers” [68]. Challenge contestants had the opportunity to win part of the $723,000 in prize money for their submitted models. In this work, we highlight how the Challenge was underpinned by a techno-solutionist framing (emphasizing technical interventions without addressing underlying structural problems) [66] and plagued by serious ethical and methodological issues, including (1) the choice of training data and the selection of an outcome variable extracted from racially biased and inaccurate law enforcement data systems, (2) data leakage that may have seriously compromised the Challenge, (3) the choice of a faulty fairness metric, leading to the inability of submitted models to accurately surface any bias issues in the data selected for the Challenge, (4) the inclusion of candidate variables that created the potential for feedback loops, (5) a Challenge structure that arguably incentivized exploiting the metrics used to judge entrants, leading to the development of trivial solutions that could not realistically work in practice, and (6) the participation of Challenge contestants who demonstrated a lack of understanding of basic aspects of the U.S. criminal legal system’s structure and functions. We analyze the Challenge and its shortcomings through the lens of participatory design, applying emerging principles for robust participatory design practices in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) development to evaluate the Challenge’s structure and results. We argue that if the Challenge’s designers had adhered to these principles, the Challenge would have looked dramatically different or would not have occurred at all. We highlight several urgent needs and potential paths forward for any future efforts of this nature, recognizing the real and significant harms of recidivism prediction tools and the need to center communities directly impacted by policing and incarceration when thinking about whether to develop risk assessment tools.},

abstract = {The intersection of language and identity refers to the ways in which language use reflects and shapes one's sense of self and group membership. It is important to design voice-based technologies that represent and support diverse types of identities to increase accessibility. Due to constraints in the data and algorithms used to train and improve artificial intelligence (AI) systems like social robots or voice assistants, they are often unable to represent certain dialects of English and other languages. This could result in data bias, identity exclusion, and communication barriers that can impact the user's outcomes when using such dialects. Technology companies are discussing how to close this gap by improving training data; however, some researchers believe that the intersection of identity and technology calls for effective collaborative design methodologies that involve intended users. This work-in-progress paper presents preliminary findings on a participatory design method, comic-boarding, that can accomplish the above goal. Using comic-boarding, our intention is to create a space for critical reflection on language and identity in human-human and human-agent dialogue for children from marginalized communities.},

abstract = {This workshop is designed to facilitate an exploration of collaborative methodologies from both academia and industry practice to advance insight into the emergent problem space of designing AI-enabled information systems. The recent developments and implementations of AI-enabled technologies have seen a parallel proliferation of practical approaches to ensure human-centred and ethical design principles are imbedded into AI development which has largely been in response to widespread industry criticism of unethical practices and unintended negative consequences of ‘black box’ algorithmic decision making. Our prototype design cards and collaborative design process are targeted at current problems and limitations with intelligent human-machine systems that can be averted with more inclusive collaboration with users as stakeholders in system design. Our intention is to refine our AI design methodology and design cards over several international workshops and to provide them to the public as a free open-source tool for AI researchers and practitioners.},

Our primary goal was to inform the first participatory design workshop of Sound of Care, a new eHealth system for pain self-management. We used an ethical stakeholder analysis to inform a round of exploratory interviews, run with 8 participants including people with chronic primary pain, carers, and healthcare workers. We found that sound and technology serve as important but often unstructured tool, helping with distraction, mood regulation and sleep. The experience of pain and musical preferences are highly personal, and communicating or understanding pain can be challenging, even within family members. To address the gaps in current chronic pain self-management care, we propose the use a sound-based AI-driven system, a Digital Pain Companion, using sonification to create a shared decision-making space, enhancing agency over treatment in a co-operative care environment.},

abstract = {The emergence of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools poses a challenge to archives and records professionals, who are accustomed to understanding and documenting the activities of human agents rather than the often-opaque processes of sophisticated AI functioning. Preliminary work has proposed the term paradata to describe the unique documentation needs that emerge for archivists using AI tools to process records in their collections. For the purposes of archivists working with AI, paradata is conceptualized here as information recorded and preserved about records’ processing with AI tools; it is a category of data that is defined both by its relationship with other datasets and by the documentary purpose it serves. This article surveys relevant literature across three contexts to scope the relevant scholarship that archivists may draw upon to develop appropriate AI documentation practices. From the statistical social sciences and the visual heritage fields, the article discusses existing definitions of paradata and its ambiguous, often contextually dependent relationship with existing metadata categories. Approaching the problem from a sociotechnical perspective, literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) insists pointedly that explainability be attuned to specific users’ stated needs—needs that archivists may better articulate using the framework of paradata. Most importantly, the article situates AI as a challenge to accountability, transparency, and impartiality in archives by introducing an unfamiliar non-human agency, one that pushes the limits of existing archival practice and demands the development of new concepts and vocabularies to shape future technological and methodological developments in archives.},

abstract = {Responsible AI is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of AI. Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.},

abstract = {The potential of AI to improve people’s lives is unlimited. However, designing AI-infused systems to realize this potential for all is challenging, and it is particularly challenging within under-served minority communities. Revisiting algorithms and data sources to eliminate biases in AI is an important step toward expanding its benefits. However, this leads to the realization that some applications, although unbiased, may simply not be what marginalized communities need. Marginalized communities live in a unique socioeconomic and cultural context and have difficulties taking advantage of traditional AI-powered systems due to language, digital literacy, or other barriers. Additionally, the systems that currently exist usually fail to address the unique challenges in these communities. Therefore, designers and researchers in AI must understand that a fundamental dimension of fairness and ethics is to empower and lift the lives of under-served populations through purposeful human-AI research. This research not only recognizes the unique intersectionality and needs present in each community, but also treats them as the primary audience by overcoming traditional barriers between researchers and underserved communities. This SIG proposal aims to initiate a multidisciplinary discussion around the design of AI systems that are purposefully targeted to marginalized populations. Within this discussion, our objective is to better understand how to conduct research to support and serve these communities – particularly if we are not members of such communities; and challenge the effectiveness of techniques like user-centered design in the context of AI-infused systems when the designer is not a member of the user community. In addition, we will delve into ways of translating research into practical applications to create a positive impact within these communities and narrow the disparities that exist in the optimal utilization of AI to improve lives for different communities.},

We used the ladder to analyze participatory approaches to AI development in recent scholarship, finding that most of this work informs or consults rather than partners with or delegates control to participants. We also found that papers frequently reflect a writing style that makes it difficult to ascertain the degree of power afforded. We discuss implications from our work for powerholders (developers, researchers, practitioners) offering participatory approaches to AI and for people (specific communities, stakeholders, general public) participating in those processes.},

abstract = {Investigative journalists and public defenders conduct the essential work of examining, reporting, and arguing critical cases around police use-of-force and misconduct. In an ideal world, they would have access to well-organized records they can easily navigate and search. In reality, records can come as large, disorganized data dumps, increasing the burden on the already resource-constrained teams. In a cross-disciplinary research team of stakeholders and computer scientists, we worked closely with public defenders and investigative journalists in the United States to co-design an AI-augmented tool that addresses challenges in working with such data dumps. Our Document Organization Tool (DOT) is a Python library that has data cleaning, extraction, and organization features. Our collaborative design process gave us insights into the needs of under-resourced teams who work with large data dumps, such as how some domain experts became self-taught programmers to automate their tasks. To understand what type of programming paradigm could support our target users, we conducted a user study (n=18) comparing visual, programming-by-example, and traditional text-based programming tools. From our user study, we found that once users passed the initial learning stage, they could comfortably use all three paradigms. Our work offers insights for designers working with under-resourced teams who want to consolidate cutting-edge algorithms and AI techniques into unified, expressive tools. We argue user-centered tool design can contribute to the broader fight for accountability and transparency by supporting existing practitioners in their work in domains like criminal justice.},

Informal caregivers go through a range of emotional experiences, which are often invisible to others. In this work, we aim to use the context of informal caregiving needs and experiences to understand how we can design future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for supporting emotion work. We conducted user studies and interviews to understand what informal caregivers perceive as emotion work in two caregiving contexts: parenting and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Based on the findings, we propose a framework for generating design requirements for AI systems that support emotion work. Our work contributes to how we can design AI to support people’s practices that involve emotion work.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of AI in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that AI systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in AI for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of AI for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive AI systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking AI ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in AI ethics more broadly.},

To address the lack of systematic understanding of how these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome, and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends and advocate for a human-centered approach.},

abstract = {This year's conference theme "HRI for all" not just raises the importance of reflecting on how to promote inclusion for every type of user but also calls for careful consideration of the different layers of people potentially impacted by such systems. In educational setups, for instance, the users to be considered first and foremost are the learners. However, teachers, school directors, therapists and parents also form a more secondary layer of users in this ecosystem. The 7th edition of R4L focuses on the issues that HRI experiments in educational environments may cause to stakeholders and how we could improve on bringing the stakeholders' point of view into the loop. This goal is expected to be achieved in a very practical and dynamic way by the means of: (i) lightening talks from the participants; (ii) two discussion panels with special guests: One with active researchers from academia and industry about their experience and point of view regarding the inclusion of stakeholders; another panel with teacher, school directors, and parents that are/were involved in HRI experiments and will share their viewpoint; (iii) semi-structured group discussions and hands-on activities with participants and panellists to evaluate and propose guidelines for good practices regarding how to promote the inclusion of stakeholders, especially teachers, in educational HRI activities. By acquiring the viewpoint from the experimenters and stakeholders and analysing them in the same workshop, we expect to identify current gaps, propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps, and capitalise on existing synergies with the collective intelligence of the two communities.},

Our findings show that citizens are concerned with the ecological limitations of urban technology, reliability, and data privacy. They also welcome the positive implications of adaptive environments and technological advancement. Participants were also reflective of how urban technology can change human experience, more generally. Our findings point to the need for flexibility, privacy, and adaptability to changing contexts, stimuli, and users in human-building interaction.},

abstract = {While anomaly detection stands among the most important and valuable problems across many scientific domains, anomaly detection research often focuses on AI methods that can lack the nuance and interpretability so critical to conducting scientific inquiry. We believe this exclusive focus on algorithms with a fixed framing ultimately blocks scientists from adopting even high-accuracy anomaly detection models in many scientific use cases. In this application paper we present the results of utilizing an alternative approach that situates the mathematical framing of machine learning based anomaly detection within a participatory design framework. In a collaboration with NASA scientists working with the PIXL instrument studying Martian planetary geochemistry as a part of the search for extra-terrestrial life; we report on over 18 months of in-context user research and co-design to define the key problems NASA scientists face when looking to detect and interpret spectral anomalies. We address these problems and develop a novel spectral anomaly detection toolkit for PIXL scientists that is highly accurate (93.4% test accuracy on detecting diffraction anomalies), while maintaining strong transparency to scientific interpretation. We also describe outcomes from a yearlong field deployment of the algorithm and associated interface, now used daily as a core component of the PIXL science team’s workflow, and directly situate the algorithm as a key contributor to discoveries around the potential habitability of Mars. Finally we introduce a new design framework which we developed through the course of this collaboration for co-creating anomaly detection algorithms: Iterative Semantic Heuristic Modeling of Anomalous Phenomena (ISHMAP), which provides a process for scientists and researchers to produce natively interpretable anomaly detection models. This work showcases an example of successfully bridging methodologies from AI and HCI within a scientific domain, and provides a resource in ISHMAP which may be used by other researchers and practitioners looking to partner with other scientific teams to achieve better science through more effective and interpretable anomaly detection tools.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely deployed in smartphone photography; and prompt-based image synthesis models have rapidly become commonplace. In this paper, we describe a Research-through-Design (RtD) project which explores this shift in the means and modes of image production via the creation and use of the Entoptic Field Camera. Entoptic phenomena usually refer to perceptions of floaters or bright blue dots stemming from the physiological interplay of the eye and brain. We use the term entoptic as a metaphor to investigate how the material interplay of data and models in AI technologies shapes human experiences of reality. Through our case study using first-person design and a field study, we offer implications for critical, reflective, more-than-human and ludic design to engage AI technologies; the conceptualisation of an RtD research space which contributes to AI literacy discourses; and outline a research trajectory concerning materiality and design affordances of AI technologies.},

abstract = {UX practitioners (UXPs) face novel challenges when working with and communicating artificial intelligence (AI) as a design material. We explore how UXPs communicate AI concepts when given hands-on experience training and experimenting with AI models. To do so, we conducted a task-based design study with 27 UXPs in which they prototyped and created a design presentation for a AI-enabled interface while having access to a simple AI model training tool. Through analyzing UXPs’ design presentations and post-activity interviews, we found that although UXPs struggled to clearly communicate some AI concepts, tinkering with AI broadened common ground when communicating with technical stakeholders. UXPs also identified key risks and benefits of AI in their designs, and proposed concrete next steps for both UX and AI work. We conclude with a sensitizing concept and recommendations for design and AI tools to enhance multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration when crafting human-centered AI experiences.},

However, it is important to understand how equity is conceptualized in practice. As a curated collection of methods, toolkits signal how equity is imagined in design. In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of 17 design toolkits related to equity. We explore alternative design approaches that address inequity in design. We evaluate whether equity toolkits align with calls for changes to design practice, as well as Nancy Fraser’s dimensions of justice. Finally, we find that design toolkits focus on the ‘digital divide’ rather than redistributing world-building power, and thus continue to keep design power with professional designers. We also find that ‘design thinking’ continues to influence design toolkits. Furthermore, the simplicity of toolkits does not engage with the complexities that shape equity in practice. We conclude with suggestions to help researchers and designers rethink design toolkits.},

abstract = {Formal methods is a field that has a long standing history within Computer Science. At its core, it involves the use of mathematical formalisms to model and reason about computer systems and programs. The application of formal methods to verify that railway signalling systems operate safely and correctly is particularly well established within academia and is now beginning to see real applications in the railway sector. However, many contemporary approaches frequently detect false positive safety violations necessitating lengthy manual analysis by expert engineers. It has been shown that such errors can be mitigated with strengthening invariants, non-trivially generated properties which hold for all reachable states, or configurations, of a program under verification. In this work, we report on the use of machine learning to explore such state spaces autonomously and provide various visual aids to assist engineers in understanding and inducing invariant properties to support verification. We conducted a focus group with an engineering team specialising in railway signalling systems, soliciting feedback on these visualisations while co-designing suggested improvements for the application domain. The results were two-fold; our visualisations allowed participants to explore candidate invariants, but also highlighted improvements to our machine learning approach by leveraging their domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Ethical principles for algorithms are gaining importance as more and more stakeholders are affected by "high-risk" algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems. Understanding how these systems work enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and to assess the systems’ adherence to ethical values. Explanations are a promising way to create understanding, but current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research does not always consider existent theories on how understanding is formed and evaluated. In this work, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of understanding by conducting a qualitative task-based study with 30 participants, including users and affected stakeholders. We use three explanation modalities (textual, dialogue, and interactive) to explain a "high-risk" ADM system to participants and analyse their responses both inductively and deductively, using the "six facets of understanding" framework by Wiggins &amp; McTighe [63]. Our findings indicate that the "six facets" framework is a promising approach to analyse participants’ thought processes in understanding, providing categories for both rational and emotional understanding. We further introduce the "dialogue" modality as a valid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction with the "explainer", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the process. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding affects participants’ perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the interdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies have outlined. We posit that drawing from theories on learning and understanding like the "six facets" and leveraging explanation modalities can guide XAI research to better suit explanations to learning processes of individuals and consequently enable their assessment of ethical values of ADM systems.},

However, scholars have begun to show that with these increasing innovations and system capabilities, emerges fairness-related harms of user experiences and racial disparities that negatively impact African American speakers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). As users of ASR, AAVE speakers’ language is less accurately recognized and processed, leading to inequitable interactions among this ethnolect community. My graduate research seeks to address this challenge by developing and validating community-collaborative methods to innovate responsible approaches toward designing more representative and equitable ASR language technologies that accommodate African American speakers of AAVE.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making and big data systems are increasingly being used to provide innovative and essential services in the public sector. Such public services that utilize AI entail many related risks and responsibilities for citizens and public sector providers. Furthermore, the distinct regulatory demands and responsibilities of public sector services require crucial consideration of inclusiveness and civic empowerment. In this empirical study, we examine practitioners’ attitudes, practices and challenges of implementing inclusive AI services in the public sector that can empower greater civic agency. We conducted in-depth interviews with ten practitioners responsible for managing, developing or designing AI-enabled public services across three big public organizations in Finland in domains relating to the municipality, taxes, and social insurance. The results show that the discussion on inclusion and civic empowerment is just in its beginning in the public sector. Practitioners perceive the concept of inclusion as devising accessible public services for all members of society. Civic empowerment was understood as 1) institutional transparency, 2) civic participation in shaping the services, and 3) easing the use of the services for their users. The research suggests two distinct socio-cultural constructs emerging among practitioners that may influence (or hinder) how civic empowerment is manifested in such services: expert cultures and risk-averse cultures. The contributions of the study are twofold. First, we describe the practitioners’ perspectives on empowerment and inclusion in regard to public sector AI. Further, we recognize how expert and risk-averse cultures among practitioners explain their actions and restraints in devising public sector AI services.},

These powerful tools can answer complex questions and, surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this paper, we present a collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task---the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely.},

abstract = {In this paper we make the case for an expanded understanding of transparency. Within the now extensive FAccT literature, transparency has largely been understood in terms of explainability. While this approach has proven helpful in many contexts, it falls short of addressing some of the more fundamental issues in the development and application of machine learning, such as the epistemic limitations of predictions and the political nature of the selection of fairness criteria. In order to render machine learning systems more democratic, we argue, a broader understanding of transparency is needed. We therefore propose to view transparency as a communicative constellation that is a precondition for meaningful democratic deliberation. We discuss four perspective expansions implied by this approach and present a case study illustrating the interplay of heterogeneous actors involved in producing this constellation. Drawing from our conceptualization of transparency, we sketch implications for actor groups in different sectors of society.},

By means of a stage-based design method, we map the ways laypeople understand AI explanations in a User Explanation Model. We also map both medical professionals and AI experts’ practice in an Expert Explanation Model. A Target Explanation Model is then proposed, which represents how experts’ practice and layperson’s understanding can be combined to design meaningful explanations. Design guidelines for meaningful AI explanations are proposed, and a prototype of AI system explanation for non-expert users in a breast cancer scenario is presented and assessed on how it affect users’ trust perceptions.},

abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion models and large language models have underpinned a new generation of powerful and accessible tools, and some of the most publicly visible applications are for artistic endeavour. Such tools, however, provide little scope for deeper understanding of AI systems, while the growing public interest in them can eclipse notice of the vibrant community of artists who have long worked with other forms of AI. We explore the potential for AI Art – particularly work in which AI is both tool and topic – to facilitate public AI literacies and consider how tactics developed before the current generative AI boom have continued relevance today. We look at the strategies of critical AI artists to scaffold public understanding of AI and enhance legibility for non-experts. This paper also investigates how collaborations between artists and AI researchers and designers can illuminate key technical and social issues relevant to the development of AI. The study entailed workshops between three professional artists who work with AI and a cross-disciplinary set of academic participants. This paper reports on these workshops and presents the intentions and strategies expressed by the artists, as well as insights of relevance to the research community on public AI literacies. We find that critical AI art can link underlying technical systems to structural issues of power and facilitate experiential learning that is situated and embodied, valuing interpretation over explanation. The findings also demonstrate the importance of transdisciplinary conversations around art, ethics and the political economy of AI technologies and how these dialogues may feed into AI design processes.},

abstract = {In recent years, discussions of responsible AI practices have seen growing support for ‘participatory AI’ approaches, intended to involve members of the public in the design and development of AI systems. Prior research has identified a lack of standardised methods or approaches for how to use participatory approaches in the AI development process. At present, there is a dearth of evidence on attitudes to and approaches for participation in the sites driving major AI developments: commercial AI labs. Through 12 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners and subject-matter experts, this paper explores how commercial AI labs understand participatory AI approaches and the obstacles they have faced implementing these practices in the development of AI systems and research. We find that while interviewees view participation as a normative project that helps achieve ‘societally beneficial’ AI systems, practitioners face numerous barriers to embedding participatory approaches in their companies: participation is expensive and resource intensive, it is ‘atomised’ within companies, there is concern about exploitation, there is no incentive to be transparent about its adoption, and it is complicated by a lack of clear context. These barriers result in a piecemeal approach to participation that confers no decision-making power to participants and has little ongoing impact for AI labs. This paper’s contribution is to provide novel empirical research on the implementation of public participation in commercial AI labs, and shed light on the current challenges of using participatory approaches in this context.},

This study explores the challenges faced by conversational UX designers working in multidisciplinary teams for understanding the design process involved in the transformation of conventional graphical interfaces to conversation flows. In-depth interviews with UX designers working in industries reveal the key challenges in the form-to-flow transformation process. Moreover, collaborative work with various stakeholders in complex work environments involves conversational artificial intelligence-engendered gap-filling work phenomena wherein UX designers tend to work across role boundaries. Our results indicate the need for added support for CUX designer including tools and guidelines to suppport form-to-flow design, tools for testing, and defining extended roles for CUX designers with collaborative perspectives for designing conversational agents in multi-channel service environments.},

Despite the long-standing and growing need for collaboration with CAD models and tools, anecdotal reports and ongoing researcher efforts point to a complex and unresolved set of challenges faced by designers when working with distributed CAD. We aim to close this academic-practitioner knowledge gap through the first systematic study of professional user-driven CAD collaboration challenges. In this work, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 CAD professionals of diverse industries, roles, and experience levels to understand their collaborative workflows with distributed CAD tools. In total, we identify 14 challenges related to collaborative design, communication, data management, and permissioning that are currently impeding effective collaboration in professional CAD teams. Our systematic classification of CAD collaboration challenges presents a guide for pressing areas of future work, highlighting important implications for CAD researchers, practitioners, and tool builders to target new advancement in CAD infrastructure, management choices, and modelling best practices. With the insights gained from this work, we hope to ultimately improve collaboration efficiency, quality, and innovation for future product design teams.},

abstract = {Recent advances in technology and reduction in hardware costs have made the collection of acoustic environmental recordings more accessible, thereby facilitating easier acquisition of biodiversity data for monitoring, research and conservation. Despite these advances, and the growing power of machine learning and automated techniques to process acoustic data, there exists a lack of tools to facilitate accessible visualisation and exploration of long-duration acoustic recordings collected in the field. Additionally, the exclusion of forest communities and traditional beliefs and practices in tropical forest conservation, originating from colonialism and continuing through neocolonial approaches, often results in tension between conservation practitioners, projects, and forest communities. While there has been a proliferation of citizen science projects, tools and applications arising from ecoacoustics research, there is a need to respond to calls, from other citizen science domains, for this work to engage with “citizens" outside the role of ‘data collector’, towards more co-creative citizen science. Through the lens of participatory design, my research attends to both issues by developing alternative methods of data visualisation that enable more accessible analysis and exploration of big ecoacoustics data, while attending to questions of conservation data justice and participation in forest fringe settings.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

abstract = {During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establishcommon ground ---a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs. Our study involved two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner that used a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study during which the autistic participants designed a game intended to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics. We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information. This project generated insights related to two distinct aspects of designing assistive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support autistic individuals: (1) the ability for visual elicitation activities to help autistic individuals recognize interaction patterns, gain a deeper understanding of other's perspectives, and imagine more desirable alternatives, and (2) the importance of recognizing and supporting multi-dimensional aspects of communication practices (i.e., social, emotional, sensory) in establishing and maintaining shared points of reference for neurodiverse conversation dyads.},

I also identify localization and translation practices as areas where indigenous epistemologies are often undermined. Against this backdrop, by employing indigenous-centered approaches, such as the integrative approach, third space, Afrikology and predominantly indigenous methodologies, TPC and UX researchers can address cultural nuances and design needs, ensuring respectful and effective communication. Furthermore, I propose the focused life-story interview method rooted in indigenous research paradigm as a means of exploring sensitive topics and fostering meaningful connections with participants. I conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to apply indigenous methodologies to ethically design artificial intelligence (AI) systems.},

abstract = {Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.},

abstract = {Administrative processes are ubiquitous in modern life and have been identified as a particular burden to those with accessibility needs. Students who have accessibility needs often have to understand guidance, fill in complex forms, and communicate with multiple parties to disclose disabilities and access appropriate support. Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) could allow us to reimagine such processes, yet there is currently limited understanding of how to design these to be accessible, or whether such an approach would be preferred. In the ADMINS (Assistants for the Disclosure and Management of Information about Needs and Support) project, we implemented a virtual assistant (VA) which is designed to enable students to disclose disabilities and to provide guidance and suggestions about appropriate support. ADMINS explores the potential of CUIs to reduce administrative burden and improve the experience of arranging support by replacing a static form with written or spoken dialogue. This article reports the results of two trials conducted during the project. A beta trial using an early version of the VA provided understanding of accessibility challenges and issues in user experience. The beta trial sample included 22 students who had already disclosed disabilities and 3 disability support advisors. After improvements to the design, a larger main trial was conducted with 134 students who disclosed their disabilities to the university using both the VA and the existing form-based process. The results show that the VA was preferred by most participants to completing the form (64.9% vs 23.9%). Qualitative and quantitative feedback from the trials also identified accessibility and user experience barriers for improving CUI design, and an understanding of benefits and preferences that can inform further development of accessible CUIs for this design space.},

The online robust preference elicitation procedure of [34] has been shown in simulation to outperform various other elicitation procedures in terms of effectively learning individuals’ true utilities. However, as with any simulation, the method makes a series of assumptions that cannot easily be verified to hold true beyond simulation. Thus, we propose to validate the robust method’s performance using real users, focusing on the particular challenge of selecting policies for prioritizing COVID-19 patients for scarce hospital resources during the pandemic. To this end, we develop an online platform for preference elicitation where users report their preferences between alternatives over a moderate number of pairwise comparisons chosen by a particular elicitation procedure. We recruit 193 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers to report their preferences and demonstrate that the robust method outperforms asking random queries by 21%, the next best performing method in the simulated results of&nbsp;[34], in terms of recommending policies with a higher utility.},

To address this disparity, we present our design fiction approach aimed at engaging citizens in speculating on HBI futures at a pop-up event. Through the pop-up format, visitors are initiated to the event’s subject matter through an exhibition and then invited to participate in a design fiction activity.

abstract = {Users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices sometimes find it difficult to communicate in real time with others due to the time it takes to compose messages. AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to support AAC users by improving the quality and variety of text suggestions. However, these technologies may fundamentally change how users interact with AAC devices as users transition from typing their own phrases to prompting and selecting AI-generated phrases. We conducted a study in which 12 AAC users tested live suggestions from a language model across three usage scenarios: extending short replies, answering biographical questions, and requesting assistance. Our study participants believed that AI-generated phrases could save time, physical and cognitive effort when communicating, but felt it was important that these phrases reflect their own communication style and preferences. This work identifies opportunities and challenges for future AI-enhanced AAC devices.},

abstract = {Can government govern artificial intelligence (AI)? One of the central questions of AI governance surrounds state capacity, namely whether government has the ability to accomplish its policy goals. We study this question by assessing how well the U.S. federal government has implemented three binding laws around AI governance: two executive orders—concerning trustworthy AI in the public sector (E.O. 13,960) and AI leadership (E.O. 13,859)—and the AI in Government Act. We conduct the first systematic empirical assessment of the implementation status of these three laws, which have each been described as central to US AI innovation. First, we track, through extensive research, line-level adoption of each mandated action. Based on publicly available information, we find that fewer than 40 percent of 45 legal requirements could be verified as having been implemented. Second, we research the specific implementation of transparency requirements at up to 220 federal agencies. We find that nearly half of agencies failed to publicly issue AI use case inventories—even when these agencies have demonstrable use cases of machine learning. Even when agencies have complied with these requirements, efforts are inconsistent. Our work highlights the weakness of U.S. state capacity to carry out AI governance mandates and we discuss implications for how to address bureaucratic capacity challenges.},

abstract = {Emerging methods for participatory algorithm design have proposed collecting and aggregating individual stakeholders’ preferences to create algorithmic systems that account for those stakeholders’ values. Drawing on two years of research across two public school districts in the United States, we study how families and school districts use students’ preferences for schools to meet their goals in the context of algorithmic student assignment systems. We find that the design of the preference language, i.e. the structure in which participants must express their needs and goals to the decision-maker, shapes the opportunities for meaningful participation. We define three properties of preference languages – expressiveness, cost, and collectivism – and discuss how these factors shape who is able to participate, and the extent to which they are able to effectively communicate their needs to the decision-maker. Reflecting on these findings, we offer implications and paths forward for researchers and practitioners who are considering applying a preference-based model for participation in algorithmic decision making.},

Whether positive or negative, these propagate simplistic assumptions about human abilities and reinforce technocratic approaches to mobility innovation. We build on narrative approaches to participatory research and adversarial design, to explore how design-led confrontation can create opportunities for reflection on implicit assumptions and narratives that stakeholders may refer to when discussing and making decisions about automated driving technologies. Specifically, we discuss the results of four focus groups where we used contestational artifacts to promote critical discussions and confront taken-for-granted beliefs among stakeholders. We reflect on the results to distill methodological insight and design recommendations for conducting adversarial participatory design research as a way towards confronting dominant narratives. Together with the methodological approach, the main contribution of this work, we also provide a set of narrative tensions that can be used to question common beliefs surrounding automated driving futures.},

abstract = {This paper combines design, machine learning and social computing to explore generative deep learning as both tool and probe for respiratory care. We first present GANspire, a deep learning tool that generates fine-grained breathing waveforms, which we crafted in collaboration with one respiratory physician, attending to joint materialities of human breathing data and deep generative models. We then relate a probe, produced with breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, and led with a group of ten respiratory care experts, responding to its material attributes. Qualitative annotations showed that respiratory care experts interpreted both realistic and ambiguous attributes of breathing waveforms generated with GANspire, according to subjective aspects of physiology, activity and emotion. Semi-structured interviews also revealed experts' broader perceptions, expectations and ethical concerns on AI technology, based on their clinical practice of respiratory care, and reflexive analysis of GANspire. These findings suggest design implications for technological aids in respiratory care, and show how ambiguity of deep generative models can be leveraged as a resource for qualitative inquiry, enabling socio-material research with generative deep learning. Our paper contributes to the CSCW community by broadening how generative deep learning may be approached not only as a tool to design human-computer interactions, but also as a probe to provoke open conversations with communities of practice about their current and speculative uses of AI technology.},

We interviewed 30 industry practitioners on their current social and ethical risk management practices and collected their first reactions on adapting safety engineering frameworks into their practice – namely, System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Our findings suggest STPA/FMEA can provide an appropriate structure for social and ethical risk assessment and mitigation processes. However, we also find nontrivial challenges in integrating such frameworks in the fast-paced culture of the ML industry. We call on the CHI community to strengthen existing frameworks and assess their efficacy, ensuring that ML systems are safer for all people.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

abstract = {Requirements elicitation is a crucial process in software engineering, which involves identifying and understanding the needs of stakeholders to define system requirements. Several techniques are used for requirements elicitation, each with unique advantages, disadvantages, and challenges. This paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among 33 practitioners in the software development community to investigate their experiences with requirements elicitation techniques. The results revealed that practitioners find the elicitation process highly challenging due to difficulties managing the relationship between the development team and the client, understanding complex business processes, and the lack of knowledge among stakeholders. The survey also assessed the participants’ familiarity with various elicitation techniques. The most well-known techniques were brainstorming, data analysis, use cases, interviews, user stories, and prototyping. In contrast, techniques such as ethnography, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Joint Application Development (JAD), blueprint, and laddering were less recognized. When providing the pros and cons of some techniques, participants considered techniques’ clarity, speed of use, resource cost, and stakeholder involvement. This research contributes to the field by highlighting challenges, providing insights into practitioner experiences, and guiding informed decision-making in requirements elicitation.},

abstract = {This paper argues for the inclusion of tools that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) in information technology (IT) undergraduate courses that teach the fundamentals of software. LLM tools have become widely available and disrupt traditional methods for teaching software concepts. Learning objectives are compromised when students submit AI-generated code for a classroom assignment without comprehending or validating the code. Since LLM tools including OpenAI Codex, Copilot by GitHub, and ChatGPT are being used in industry for software development, students need to be familiar with their use without compromising student learning. Incorporating LLM tools into the curriculum prepares students for real-world software development. However, students still need to understand software fundamentals including how to write and debug code. There are many challenges associated with the inclusion of AI tools into the IT curriculum that need to be addressed and mitigated. This paper presents strategies and techniques to integrate student use of LLM tools, assist students’ interaction with the tools, and help prepare students for careers that increasingly use AI tools to design, develop, and maintain software.},

However, as these autonomous systems evolve from reactive, i.e., acting on user input, to proactive, i.e., acting without requiring user intervention, there is a need to explore how the explanation for the actions of these agents should evolve. In this work, we explore the design of explanations through participatory design methods for a proactive auto-response messaging agent that can reduce perceived obligations and social pressure to respond quickly to incoming messages by providing unavailability-related context. We recruited 14 participants who worked in pairs during collaborative design sessions where they reasoned about the agent's design and actions. We qualitatively analyzed the data collected through these sessions and found that participants' reasoning about agent actions led them to speculate heavily on its design. These speculations significantly influenced participants' desire for explanations and the controls they sought to inform the agents' behavior. Our findings indicate a need to transform users' speculations into accurate mental models of agent design. Further, since the agent acts as a mediator in human-human communication, it is also necessary to account for social norms in its explanation design. Finally, user expertise in understanding their habits and behaviors allows the agent to learn from the user their preferences when justifying its actions.},

We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test, while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments. This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.},

abstract = {One of the important roles of social robots is to support mental health through conversations with people. In this study, we focused on the column method to support cognitive restructuring, which is also used as one of the programs in psychiatric day care, and to help patients think flexibly and understand their own characteristics. To develop a robot that assists psychiatric day care patients in organizing their thoughts about their worries and goals through conversation, we designed the robot's conversation content based on the column method and implemented its autonomous conversation function. This paper reports on the preliminary experiments conducted to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of this prototype system in an actual psychiatric day care setting, and on the comments from participants in the experiments and day care staff.},

abstract = {Incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives is seen as an essential step towards enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) ethics. In this regard, the field of arts is perceived to play a key role in elucidating diverse historical and cultural narratives, serving as a bridge across research communities. Most of the works that examine the interplay between the field of arts and AI ethics concern digital artworks, largely exploring the potential of computational tools in being able to surface biases in AI systems. In this paper, we investigate a complementary direction–that of uncovering the unique socio-cultural perspectives embedded in human-made art, which in turn, can be valuable in expanding the horizon of AI ethics. Through semi-structured interviews across sixteen artists, art scholars, and researchers of diverse Indian art forms like music, sculpture, painting, floor drawings, dance, etc., we explore how non-Western ethical abstractions, methods of learning, and participatory practices observed in Indian arts, one of the most ancient yet perpetual and influential art traditions, can shed light on aspects related to ethical AI systems. Through a case study concerning the Indian dance system (i.e. the ‘Natyashastra’), we analyze potential pathways towards enhancing ethics in AI systems. Insights from our study outline the need for (1) incorporating empathy in ethical AI algorithms, (2) integrating multimodal data formats for ethical AI system design and development, (3) viewing AI ethics as a dynamic, diverse, cumulative, and shared process rather than as a static, self-contained framework to facilitate adaptability without annihilation of values (4) consistent life-long learning to enhance AI accountability},

abstract = {With the growing need to regulate AI systems across a wide variety of application domains, a new set of occupations has emerged in the industry. The so-called responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners or AI ethicists are generally tasked with interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safe design of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives. In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes to business leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educators with a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent around the world, with the benefits related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability attractive in addition to the opportunity to establish entirely new capabilities. In order to operationalise autonomous systems technology it is critical to have in place the legal, regulatory and ethical infrastructure necessary to enable safe and trusted operation. While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems. The paper concludes by recommending next steps towards the regulation of safe and trusted autonomous systems, including a focus on collaboration and experimentation.},

Despite these contributions, the technology can also create biases and discrimination in communities and among other risks. So far, the literature is focused on the technology level addressing performance efficiency and process improvement. In contrast, the literature lacks a comprehensive approach for planning AI projects and use case identification for government and public service delivery. The core question addressed in this paper is what factors should be considered when determining AI-related problems and establishing viable use cases. To address this question, the paper critically reviews existing approaches using the Context, Content, and Process (CCP) framework to identify problems and formulate AI use cases. Findings from the review rationalise the research gap and propose preliminary components that are significant in planning AI projects for the government.},

Robots have been proposed to help engage older adults in physical activity (PA), albeit with limited success. There is a lack of robust understanding of older adults' needs and wants from robots designed to engage them in PA. In this paper, we report on the findings of a co-design process where older adults, physical therapy experts, and engineers designed robots to promote PA in older adults. We found a variety of motivators for and barriers against PA in older adults; we, then, conceptualized a broad spectrum of possible robotic support and found that robots can play various roles to help older adults engage in PA. This exploratory study elucidated several overarching themes and emphasized the need for personalization and adaptability. This work highlights key design features that researchers and engineers should consider when developing robots to engage older adults in PA, and underscores the importance of involving various stakeholders in the design and development of assistive robots.},

abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {Seamless human-computer interaction (HCI) was first proposed at the end of the last century. Since then, it has evolved, faced challenges, and recently experienced a revival across emerging HCI domains, driven by advancements in AI and 5G technologies. However, its concept has undergone significant changes. Within the context of user experience (UX) design, this term typically emphasizes the harmonious integration of various input, output modalities, and platforms to create a cohesive and consistent experience in interactive surface and spaces. In this workshop, we bring together academia and industry voices from around the globe, spanning mobile interaction, automotive human-machine interface (HMI), musical entertainment, mixed reality (MR) and wearables domains. We delve into the technology-driven transformation of seamless multimodal experience (SME), through addressing theoretical and methodological issues, exploring dimensions, guidelines, opportunities, as well as challenges for seamlessness innovation in HCI. Concurrently, we investigate approaches to harness these technologies to unlock the potential of multimodal user interfaces (MUIs) in seamless interactions. More broadly, we explore innovative SME concepts using a participatory design tool. Our collective goal is to achieve a shared understanding among participants and establish a framework of SME that will guide future human-computer interaction from physical to virtual spaces.},

These technologies are rapidly being integrated into children's everyday lives, but their functions and implications are rarely understood due to their complex and distributed nature. The review provides a rigorous overview of the state of the art based on 107 records published across the fields of human-computer interaction, learning sciences, computing education, and child–computer interaction between 2010 and 2020.&nbsp;The findings show the urgent need on a global scale for inter- and transdisciplinary research that can integrate these dispersed contributions into a more coherent field of research and practice. The article presents nine discussion points for developing a shared agenda to mature the field. Based on the HCI community's expertise in human-centred approaches to technology and aspects of learning, we argue that the community is ideally positioned to take a leading role in the realisation of this future research agenda.},

abstract = {AI is rapidly becoming enmeshed in our professional and private lives. The ubiquity of such technologies raises a host of ethical questions, value clashes, and unforeseen consequences that must be confronted. Developments such as Ai-Da and DALL-E 2 are exciting in that they present robust new capabilities in AI and creativity. However, the futures such technologies unlock are also unpredictable. Given the speed with which such technologies are emerging and becoming adopted, the need to engage target audiences to weigh in on possible AI futures is critical. Our pilot project, Artistic Process Futures and AI, seeks to explore the role and potential implications of AI technologies with artists. In this paper, we show how participatory speculative design processes might be channeled into a public statement, or manifesto, regarding possible and preferable AI futures for supporting the artistic process, and how our workshop exposed uncertainty at the core of such deliberation.},

abstract = {Digitally replicating the appearance and behaviour of individuals is becoming feasible with recent advancements in deep-learning technologies such as interactive deepfake applications, voice conversion, and virtual actors. Interactive applications of such agents, termed AI clones, pose risks related to impression management, identity abuse, and unhealthy dependencies. Identifying concerns AI clones will generate is a prerequisite to establishing the basis of discourse around how this technology will impact a source individual's selfhood and interpersonal relationships. We presented 20 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds with 8 speculative scenarios to explore their perception towards the concept of AI clones. We found that (1. doppelganger-phobia) the abusive potential of AI clones to exploit and displace the identity of an individual elicits negative emotional reactions; (2. identity fragmentation) creating replicas of a living individual threatens their cohesive self-perception and unique individuality; and (3. living memories) interacting with a clone of someone with whom the user has an existing relationship poses risks of misrepresenting the individual or developing over-attachment to the clone. These findings provide an avenue to discuss preliminary ethical implications, respect for identity and authenticity, and design recommendations for creating AI clones.},

abstract = {To address pressing issues of bias and black boxing embedded in technologies and their underlying computational models, scholars call for inventing and employing design processes that invite participation from those whose lives are shaped by these technologies. In response, we reimagine not only how technologies and their models are designed, but also who designs them. We present our work toward developing the concept of gathering as a design process that invites physical prototyping as an important mechanism in developing culturally sustaining technologies. Gathering is inspired by “Hui,” an ‘undefinedlelo Hawai‘i Hawaiian language word translated as: to band together, assemble, organize. We share our ongoing journey of inventing and engaging in gathering and present four characteristics of gathering as a design process. Our work has implications for how we design new forms of technology toward more equitable futures, especially by making visible decision making and sensemaking that occurs throughout the design process.},

abstract = {Water supply and drainage systems, which are categorized as critical infrastructure, serve a crucial role in preserving societal health and well-being. Since climate change effects, harsher regulations, population changes, and aging infrastructure pose problems for these systems, the industry is experiencing a digital transition to meet these concerns. This article addresses Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and its application to water distribution networks, combining cyber, physical, and social components for adaptive, responsive, and intelligent management. This paper’s primary contributions include a review of recent security problems in the water industry, which emphasizes the necessity for stronger security measures. The article also examines how water distribution networks, as CPSS, fit into the interrelated realms of physical infrastructure, digital components, and stakeholder involvement, necessitating an all-encompassing system design and management strategy. In addition, the article investigates various cyber-physical attack scenarios, risk management methodologies, and the crucial role of integrated knowledge in mitigating these risks. In the context of increasing digitalization, the paper emphasizes the significance of taking into account both water infrastructure regulations under social space, such as the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD), and cyberspace-related legal and legislative standards, such as the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Cybersecurity Act. By tackling these difficulties and concentrating on privacy concerns, water utilities may contribute to the overall security and resiliency of vital infrastructure while assuring compliance with applicable legislation.},

We introduce a bespoke toolkit of technologies and showcase how we utilised the toolkit to engage communities of under-heard language speakers; and, through that engagement process, situate key aspects of ASR development in community contexts. The toolkit consists of (1) an information appliance to facilitate spoken-data collection on topics of community interest, (2) a mobile app to create crowdsourced transcripts of collected data, and (3) demonstrator systems to showcase ASR capabilities and to feed back research results to community members. Drawing on the sensibilities we cultivated through this research, we present a series of challenges to the orthodoxy of state-of-the-art approaches to ASR development.},

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

abstract = {As algorithms have become ubiquitous in consequential domains, societal concerns about the potential for discriminatory outcomes have prompted urgent calls to address algorithmic bias. In response, a rich literature across computer science, law, and ethics is rapidly proliferating to advance approaches to designing fair algorithms. Yet computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists are often not speaking the same language when using the term ‘bias.’ Debates concerning whether society can or should tackle the problem of algorithmic bias are hampered by conflations of various understandings of bias, ranging from neutral deviations from a standard to morally problematic instances of injustice due to prejudice, discrimination, and disparate treatment. This terminological confusion impedes efforts to address clear cases of discrimination. In this paper, we examine the promises and challenges of different approaches to disambiguating bias and designing for justice. While both approaches aid in understanding and addressing clear algorithmic harms, we argue that they also risk being leveraged in ways that ultimately deflect accountability from those building and deploying these systems. Applying this analysis to recent examples of generative AI, our argument highlights unseen dangers in current methods of evaluating algorithmic bias and points to ways to redirect approaches to addressing bias in generative AI at its early stages in ways that can more robustly meet the demands of justice.},

Despite the inclusion of dignity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, like many other AI ethics principles, there is little operational understanding of what dignity can look like in practice when it comes to the development of algorithms. Drawing on cybernetics and a model of dignity developed in the field of international conflict resolution, this paper presents our work-in-progress tool - the Dignity Lens - for considering dignity throughout the AI development lifecycle, and practitioner reflections from using the tool. This work is an initial step towards articulating what dignity-centred AI development could look like in practice, assisting practitioners designing and developing algorithms to actively consider dignity.},

This complexity requires better addressing the situated and interrelated aspects of sensemaking practices and platforms, and how different disciplines and organisations collaborate during a crisis to turn ambiguity into resilience, and complexity into comprehension. We use design research and participatory design methodology to draw on learnings from the Finnish context and response to COVID-19 and other crises. These insights are then used to create design principles that bridge crisis informatics theory with HCI knowledge to create speculative, diegetic artefacts, which embody new practices and platforms that can be used to encourage collaborative sensemaking to tackle complex, large-scale crises and therefore have a positive impact on the resilience of the society.},

We investigated the approaches to annotator diversity through 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 44 AI/ML practitioners. While practitioners described nuanced understandings of annotator diversity, they rarely designed dataset production to account for diversity in the annotation process. The lack of action was explained through operational barriers: from the lack of visibility in the annotator hiring process, to the conceptual difficulty in incorporating worker diversity. We argue that such operational barriers and the widespread resistance to accommodating annotator diversity surface a prevailing logic in data practices—where neutrality, objectivity and ‘representationalist thinking’ dominate. By understanding this logic to be part of a regime of existence, we explore alternative ways of accounting for annotator subjectivity and diversity in data practices.},

abstract = {Emotion-aware services are increasingly used in different applications such as gaming, mental health tracking, video conferencing, and online tutoring. The core of such services is usually a machine learning model that automatically infers its user's emotions based on different biological indicators (e.g., physiological signals and facial expressions). However, such machine learning models often require a large number of emotion annotations or ground truth labels, which are typically collected as manual self-reports by conducting long-term user studies, commonly known as Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Responding to repetitive ESM probes for self-reports is time-consuming and fatigue-inducing. The burden of repetitive self-report collection leads to users responding arbitrarily or dropping out from the studies, compromising the model performance. To counter this issue, we, in this paper, propose a Human-AI Collaborative Emotion self-report collection framework, HACE, that reduces the self-report collection effort significantly. HACE encompasses an active learner, bootstrapped with a few emotion self-reports (as seed samples), and enables the learner to query for only not-so-confident instances to retrain the learner to predict the emotion self-reports more efficiently. We evaluated the framework in a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection scenario by performing a 3-week in-the-wild study (N = 32). The evaluation of HACE on this dataset (≈11,000 typing sessions corresponding to more than 200 hours of typing data) demonstrates that it requires 46% fewer self-reports than the baselines to train the emotion self-report detection model and yet outperforms the baselines with an average self-report detection F-score of 85%. These findings demonstrate the possibility of adopting such a human-AI collaborative approach to reduce emotion self-report collection efforts.},

Unfortunately, for the 1.8 million Americans with motor impairments who cannot eat without assistance, challenges restrict them from enjoying this pleasant social ritual. In this work, we identify the needs of participants with motor impairments during social dining and how robot-assisted feeding can address them. Using speculative videos that show robot behaviors within a social dining context, we interviewed participants to understand their preferences. Following a community-based participatory research method, we worked with a community researcher with motor impairments throughout this study. We contribute (a) insights into how a robot can help overcome challenges in social dining, (b) design principles for creating robot-assisted feeding systems, (c) and an implementation guide for future research in this area. Our key finding is that robots' unique assistive qualities can address challenges people with motor impairments face during social dining, promoting empowerment and belonging.},

First, I will explore how audiences and creators recognize creator moderation's compatibility with platform ecosystem (e.g., monetization, recommendation algorithms). Second, I will organize participatory design workshops with stakeholders such as creators, commercial moderators, and audiences to redesign creator moderation to balance different stakeholders’ stakes and platform's top-down moderation efforts.

To investigate this problem, prior work by Zhang &amp; Wobbrock (2023) developed multimodal interaction techniques in a prototype system called A11yBoard, but their system was limited to a single artboard in a self-contained prototype and was unable to support real-world use. In this work, we present a major extension of A11yBoard that expands upon its initial interaction techniques, addresses numerous real-world issues, and makes it deployable with Google Slides. We describe the new features developed for A11yBoard for Google Slides along with our participatory design process with a blind co-author. We also present two case studies based on real-world deployments showing that participants were able to independently complete slide reading and authoring tasks that were not possible without sighted assistance previously. We conclude with several design guidelines for making accessible digital content creation tools.},

We take an alternative approach for improving decision-making, using machine learning to help stakeholders surface ways to improve and make fairer decision-making processes. We created "Deliberating with AI", a web tool that enables people to create and evaluate ML models in order to examine strengths and shortcomings of past decision-making and deliberate on how to improve future decisions. We apply this tool to a context of people selection, having stakeholders---decision makers (faculty) and decision subjects (students)---use the tool to improve graduate school admission decisions. Through our case study, we demonstrate how the stakeholders used the web tool to create ML models that they used as boundary objects to deliberate over organization decision-making practices. We share insights from our study to inform future research on stakeholder-centered participatory AI design and technology for organizational decision-making.},

abstract = {The decades-old debate over so-called ‘responsibility gaps’ in intelligent systems has recently been reinvigorated by rapid advances in machine learning techniques that are delivering many of the capabilities of machine autonomy that Matthias [1] originally anticipated. The emerging capabilities of intelligent learning systems highlight and exacerbate existing challenges with meaningful human control of, and accountability for, the actions and effects of such systems. The related challenge of human ‘answerability’ for system actions and harms has come into focus in recent literature on responsibility gaps [2, 3]. We describe a proposed interdisciplinary approach to designing for answerability in autonomous systems, grounded in an instrumentalist framework of ‘responsible agency cultivation’ drawn from moral philosophy and cognitive sciences as well as empirical results from structured interviews and focus groups in the application domains of health, finance and government. We outline a prototype dialogue agent informed by these emerging results and designed to help bridge the structural gaps in organisations that typically impede the human agents responsible for an autonomous sociotechnical system from answering to vulnerable patients of responsibility.},

abstract = {Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists’ expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.},

Our method focuses on efficiently establishing successful task-oriented communication in an open multi-agent system, where the agents do not know anything about each other and can only communicate via grounded interaction. The method aims to assist researchers that work on human-machine interaction or scenarios that require a human-in-the-loop, by defining interaction restrictions and efficiency metrics. To that end, we point out the challenges and limitations of such a (diverse) setup, while also restrictions and requirements which aim to ensure that high task performance truthfully reflects the extent to which the agents correctly understand each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate a use-case where our method can be applied for the task of cooperative query answering. We design the experiments by modifying an established ontology alignment benchmark. In this example, the agents want to query each other, while representing different databases, defined in their own ontologies that contain different and incomplete knowledge. Grounded interaction here has the form of examples that consists of common instances, for which the agents are expected to have similar knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate successful communication establishment under the required restrictions, and compare different agent policies that aim to solve the task in an efficient manner.},

abstract = {This one-day hybrid workshop builds on previous feminist CSCW workshops to explore feminist theoretical and methodological approaches that have provided us with useful tools to see things differently and make space for change. Since its inception over a decade ago, feminist HCI has progressed from the margins to mainstream HCI, with numerous references in the literature. Feminist HCI has also evolved to incorporate other critical HCI practices such as Queer HCI, participatory design, and speculative design. While feminist approaches have grown in popularity and become mainstream, it is getting more difficult to distinguish the feminist emancipatory core from other attempts of developing and improving society in various ways. In this workshop, we therefore want to revisit our feminist roots, where theory is a liberatory and creative practice, motivated by affect, curiosity, and wonder. From this standpoint, we consider which of our feminist tools can make a significant difference today, in a highly datafied world. The goal of this workshop is to; 1) create an inventory of feminist theories and concepts that have had an impact on our work as designers, educators, researchers, and activists; 2) develop a feminist toolbox for the CSCW community to strengthen our feminist literacy.},

abstract = {How to protect people from algorithmic harms? A promising solution, although in its infancy, is algorithmic impact assessment (AIA). AIAs are iterative processes used to investigate the possible short and long terms societal impacts of AI systems before their use, but with ongoing monitoring and periodic revisiting even after their implementation. When conducted in a participatory and transparent fashion, they could create bridges across the legal, social and computer science domains, promoting the accountability of the entity performing them as well as public scrutiny. They could enable to re-attach the societal and regulatory context to the mathematical definition of fairness, thus expanding the formalistic approach thereto. Whilst the regulatory framework in the European Union currently lacks the obligation to perform such AIA, some other provisions are expected to play a role in AI development, leading the way towards more widespread adoption of AIA. These include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the risk assessment process under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Conformity Assessment (CA) foreseen under the AI Regulation proposal.In this paper, after briefly introducing the plurality of definitions of fairness in the legal, social and computer science domains, and explaining to which extent the current and upcoming legal framework mandates the adoption of fairness metrics, we will illustrate how AIA could create bridges between all these disciplines, allowing us to build fairer AI solutions. We will then recognise the role of DPIA, DSA risk assessment and CA by discussing the contributions they can offer towards AIA but also identify the aspects lacking therein. We will then identify how these assessment provisions could aid the overall technical discussion of introducing and assessing fairness in AI-based models and processes.},

abstract = {The AI Ethics community faces an imperative to empower stakeholders and impacted community members so that they can scrutinize and influence the design, development, and use of AI systems in high-stakes domains. While a growing chorus of recent papers has kindled interest in so-called “participatory ML” methods, precisely what form participation ought to take and how to operationalize these ambitions are seldom addressed. Our survey of the relevant literature shows that in many papers, participation is reduced to highly structured, computational mechanisms designed to elicit mathematically tractable approximations of narrowly-defined moral values. Of papers that actually engage with real people, these engagements typically consist of one-time interactions with individuals that are often unrepresentative of the relevant stakeholders. Motivated by these clear limitations, we introduce a consolidated set of axes to evaluate and improve participatory approaches. We use these axes to analyze contemporary work in this space and outline future AI research directions that could meaningfully contribute to operationalizing the ideal of participation.},

Yet, it is often underused due to a lack of visualization skills and time needed to sketch and detail. Current visual co-creation tools can support this with existing images, whereas generative AI can produce entirely new images from textual prompts, allowing for highly specific, personalized results. In this paper, we explore how AI image generation can be used to enhance inspiration and communication throughout collaborative design. We introduce BrainFax, a tool that facilitates generating, editing, and sharing images with AI through a chat bot and online whiteboard. Through co-creation with designers in the field, we found that AI image generation can boost designerly co-creation, yet needs careful embedding into a workflow to leverage inspirational and communicative creations. We close with a critical perspective on the implications of this technology for design and discuss limitations and future work.},

This shift towards Responsible AI (RAI) in the tech industry necessitates new practices and adaptations to roles—undertaken by a variety of practitioners in more or less formal positions, many of whom focus on the user-centered aspects of AI. To better understand practices at the intersection of user experience (UX) and RAI, we conducted an interview study with industrial UX practitioners and RAI subject matter experts, both of whom are actively involved in addressing RAI concerns throughout the early design and development of new AI-based prototypes, demos, and products, at a large technology company. Many of the specific practices and their associated challenges have yet to be surfaced in the literature, and distilling them offers a critical view into how practitioners’ roles are adapting to meet present-day RAI challenges. We present and discuss three emerging practices in which RAI is being enacted and reified in UX practitioners’ everyday work. We conclude by arguing that the emerging practices, goals, and types of expertise that surfaced in our study point to an evolution in praxis, with associated challenges that suggest important areas for further research in HCI.},

To address this, we introduce ConceptEVA, a mixed-initiative approach to generate, evaluate, and customize summaries for long and multi-topic documents. ConceptEVA incorporates a custom multi-task longformer encoder decoder to summarize longer documents. Interactive visualizations of document concepts as a network reflecting both semantic relatedness and co-occurrence help users focus on concepts of interest. The user can select these concepts and automatically update the summary to emphasize them. We present two iterations of ConceptEVA evaluated through an expert review and a within-subjects study. We find that participants’ satisfaction with customized summaries through ConceptEVA is higher than their own manually-generated summary, while incorporating critique into the summaries proved challenging. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing summarization systems incorporating mixed-initiative interactions.},

The seminar discussions were centered around five core topics: (1) agile end-toend handling of uncertainties in goal-oriented self-adaptive systems, (2) managing uncertainty risks for self-adaptive systems, (3) uncertainty propagation and interaction, (4) uncertainty in self-adaptive machine learning systems, and (5) human empowerment under uncertainty. Building on the insights from these discussions, we propose a research agenda listing key open challenges, and a possible way forward for addressing them in the coming years.},

But in the actual busy lives of users, ambient notifications might be forgotten or even missed, nullifying the original notification. Could a system use multiple levels of noticeability to ensure its message is received, and how could this concept be effectively portrayed? To examine these questions, we took a Research through Design approach and created plant-mimicking Shape-Changing Interface (S-CI) artifacts, then conducted interviews with 10 participants who currently used a reminder system for health-related activities. We report findings on acceptable scenarios to disrupting people for health-related activities, and participants’ reactions to our design choices, including how using naturalistic aesthetics led to interpretations of the uncanny and morose, and which ways system physicality affected imagined uses. We offer design suggestions in health-related notification systems and S-CIs, and discuss future work in ambient-to-disruptive technology.},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms by and large determine what people see on social media. Users know little about how these algorithms work or what information they use to make their recommendations. But what exactly should platforms share with users about recommendation algorithms that would be meaningful to them? Research has looked into frameworks for explainability of algorithms as well as design features across social media platforms that can contribute to their transparency and accountability. We build on these prior efforts to explore what a recommendation algorithm transparency report may include and how it should present information to users. Through a human-centered co-design research process we result in: (1) A set of guidelines for recommendation algorithm transparency reports; (2) initial suggestions, in the form of prototypes, for more engaging and interactive forms of transparency; (3) an evaluation of these prototypes’ strengths and weaknesses, and areas of exploration for future work.},

abstract = {In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.},

abstract = {Youth regularly use technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is increasingly well-known that AI can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.},

Training the dataset on a sequence-to sequence model reveals a stereotypical bias in the machine translation system associated with a high-status profession like 'engineering.' The quality of translation for sentences associated with 'he' is higher than 'she.' Hence, a proposed data design approach is made to help examine bias in the dataset. The quality of the translation of sentences associated with either 'he’ or 'she’ improved and got either identical bleu scores or just a little difference in the bleu scores.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations make use of rapidly evolving sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms to collect rich data about learning activities that unfold in physical spaces. The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations “in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This article addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to (i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; (ii) multimodal data and interfaces; (iii) the design process; (iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and (v) sustainability of the deployment.},

abstract = {AI curricula are being developed and tested in classrooms, but wider adoption is premised by teacher professional development and buy-in. When engaging in professional development, curricula are treated as set in stone, static and educators are prepared to offer the curriculum as written instead of empowered to be leaders in efforts to spread and sustain AI education. This limits the degree to which teachers tailor new curricula to student needs and interests, ultimately distancing students from new and potentially relevant content. This paper describes an AI Educator Make-a-Thon, a two-day gathering of 34 educators from across the United States that centered co-design of AI literacy materials as the culminating experience of a year-long professional development program called Everyday AI (EdAI) in which educators studied and practiced implementing an innovative curriculum for Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) in their classrooms. Inspired by the energizing and empowering experiences of Hack-a-Thons, the Make-a-Thon was designed to increase the depth and longevity of the educators' investment in AI education by positively impacting their sense of belonging to the AI community, AI content knowledge, and their self confidence as AI curriculum designers. In this paper we describe the Make-a-Thon design, findings, and recommendations for future educator-centered Make-a-Thons.},

abstract = {With the development of quantum computing, the existing cryptography schemes based on classical cryptographic primitives will no longer be secure. Hence, cryptographers are designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes, and ideal lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. Today, as ideal lattice-based cryptography becomes more mature, its performance becomes an important optimization goal. In ideal lattice-based cryptography, polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling are the most time-consuming operations and therefore need to be accelerated. In this article, taking advantage of the parallelism of new 512-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX512), we present parallel implementations of polynomial arithmetic and polynomial sampling, thus comprehensively improving their performance. We conduct experiments with the Dilithium scheme(one scheme of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-4). Our implementation gets a nice performance boost compared to its pure C language and 256-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX2) implementation.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, ubiquitous sensors and systems have been an integral part of humans’ everyday life. They augment human capabilities and provide personalized experiences across diverse contexts such as healthcare, education, and transportation. However, the widespread adoption of ubiquitous computing has also brought forth concerns regarding fairness and equitable treatment. As these systems can make automated decisions that impact individuals, it is essential to ensure that they do not perpetuate biases or discriminate against specific groups. While fairness in ubiquitous computing has been an acknowledged concern since the 1990s, it remains understudied within the field. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that incorporates fairness considerations into system design, including prioritizing stakeholder perspectives, inclusive data collection, fairness-aware algorithms, appropriate evaluation criteria, enhancing human engagement while addressing privacy concerns, and interactive improvement and regular monitoring. Our framework aims to guide the development of fair and unbiased ubiquitous computing systems, ensuring equal treatment and positive societal impact.},

Resilience within autonomous systems must also account for social norms as well as broader ethical and legal considerations. Within this paper we outline the importance of embedding Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic and Cultural (SLEEC) constraints within the development of future autonomous systems. A novel methodological approach is presented that combines Human Factors methods with Computer Science techniques to generate the environmental and situational requirements in combination with a computer rule-based requirements language. This approach also provides a possible structure for capturing contextual and situational information from key stakeholders in the development of autonomous systems. This structure will enable engagement with the stakeholders with respect to key elements identified from this interdisciplinary approach in a responsible way to ensure that future autonomous systems are user centred. The approach is domain independent, but it is applied here to the case of an autonomous assistive dressing robot that aids a user in a dressing task, with a specific critical event that requires a SLEEC resilient response},

abstract = {In recent years, a proliferation of women’s safety mobile applications have emerged in India that crowdsource street safety perceptions to generate ‘safety maps’ used by policy makers for urban design and academics for studying mobility patterns. Men and women’s differential access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), however, and the distinctions between their social and cultural subjective experiences may mitigate the value of crowdsourced safety perceptions data and the predictive ability of machine learning (ML) models utilizing such data. We explore this by collecting and analyzing primary data on safety perceptions from New Delhi, India. Our curated dataset consists of streetviews covering a wide range of neighborhoods for which we obtain subjective safety ratings from both female and male respondents. Simulation experiments where varying the proportion of ratings from each gender are assumed missing demonstrate that the predictive ability of standard ML techniques relies crucially on the distribution of data producers. We find that obtaining large amounts of crowdsourced safety labels from male respondents for predicting female safety perceptions is inefficient in a number of scenarios and even undesirable in others. Detailed comparisons between female and male respondents’ data demonstrate significant gender differences in safety perceptions and associated vocabularies. Our results have important implications for the design of platforms relying on crowdsourced data and the insights generated from them.},

abstract = {Even though a broad range of social robots are currently available on the market, social robots are not yet an integral part of companies, healthcare providers, or public institutions. This might be due to the fact that the prevalent developer perspective immanently focuses on technological advancements, whereas a human-centered view remains underrepresented. In this paper, we argue that a human-centered perspective which integrates values and beliefs of relevant technology stakeholders needs to complement existing approaches to social robot design. Therefore, we propose to apply value sensitive design (VSD) to improve the process of social robot development and design. Even though VSD has become popular in recent years and it represents an established approach to foster innovative technologies, it has not yet been widely applied in the context of social robotics. Concretely, in this paper we will outline the added value of using VSD for social robots and we will explain how to utilize this methodology to enrich research and practice in social robotics.},

abstract = {Autistic children’s emotional meltdown is a common challenge faced by their caregivers, including their teachers and families. Communicating their problems can be extremely challenging for many autistic children, making it difficult for caregivers to identify the triggers of these meltdowns. Previous studies have revealed that autistic children find it easier to communicate with non-human objects, such as comfort dolls or social robots. In light of this, we have designed Kodi, a mobile virtual conversational agent aimed at bridging the communication gap between autistic children and their caregivers during distressing situations. Kodi’s appearance can be personalized to match the child’s favorite characters, such as a bunny or a dinosaur. To provide additional comfort, Kodi comes with furry phone cases that offer haptic stimulation. When the child faces stressful situations, caregivers can prompt Kodi on children’s mobile device, allowing the child to express their emotions with various input modalities (emojis, text, voice) and listen to soothing stories. Caregivers can tailor these stories to suit each child’s unique needs. Furthermore, Kodi will employ keyword analysis to summarize conversations, identify potential triggers for emotional meltdowns (e.g., loud noises in a shopping mall, unexpected changes at school), and alert caregivers of potential problems, such as bullying. The data collected through Kodi holds the potential to be leveraged for predicting emotional meltdowns using machine learning techniques. This paper discusses the implications of the Kodi platform and outlines future research directions in this area.},

abstract = {Design fixation, a phenomenon describing designers' adherence to pre-existing ideas or concepts that constrain design outcomes, is particularly prevalent in human-robot interaction (HRI), for example, due to collectively held and stabilised imaginations of what a robot should look like or behave. In this paper, we explore the contribution of creative AI tools to overcome design fixation and enhance creative processes in HRI design. In a four weeks long design exploration, we used generative text-to-image models to ideate and visualise robotic artefacts and robot sociotechnical imaginaries. We exchanged results along with reflections through a digital postcard format. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to imagining novel robot concepts, surfacing existing assumptions and robot stereotypes, and situating robotic artefacts in context. We discuss the contribution to designerly HRI practices and conclude with lessons learnt for using creative AI tools as an emerging design practice in HRI research and beyond.},

abstract = {Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is inherently a human-centric field of technology. The role of feminist theories in related fields (e.g. Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science) are taken as a starting point to present a vision for Feminist HRI which can support better, more ethical HRI practice everyday, as well as a more activist research and design stance. We first define feminist design for an HRI audience and use a set of feminist principles from neighboring fields to examine existent HRI literature, showing the progress that has been made already alongside some additional potential ways forward. Following this we identify a set of reflexive questions to be posed throughout the HRI design, research and development pipeline, encouraging a sensitivity to power and to individuals' goals and values. Importantly, we do not look to present a definitive, fixed notion of Feminist HRI, but rather demonstrate the ways in which bringing feminist principles to our field can lead to better, more ethical HRI, and to discuss how we, the HRI community, might do this in practice.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving mental health, and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content generation for mindfulness practice in these methods, high-quality computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However, the user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation, which requires emotional expressiveness. In addition, work has not yet been done to study the effect of physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS voices for mindfulness. To that end, we designed a two-phase human subject study. In Phase 1, an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471) evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with 2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists' voices in 3 different physical embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot) with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices. Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices, suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.},

Online platforms seek to moderate such content to limit societal harm, to comply with legislation, and to create a more inclusive environment for their users. Researchers have developed different methods for automatically detecting harmful content, often focusing on specific sub-problems or on narrow communities, as what is considered harmful often depends on the platform and on the context. We argue that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of harmful content online platforms seek to curb, and what research efforts there are to automatically detect such content. We thus survey existing methods as well as content moderation policies by online platforms in this light and suggest directions for future work.},

What remains behind the scenes of these predictions and imaginaries of automation is the invisible human labor of global ghost workers caring for, maintaining, and repairing technologies. Invisible but irreplaceable, computation performed by humans in precarious conditions fills gaps that computer technologies lack skills and sensibility for. In this hybrid workshop, we ask who the “ghosts” are in the machines.

Additionally, robots should be an inclusive tool, accessible to all, yet typical introductory human-robot interactions rely heavily on the human's visual perceptions. For children and young people with sight loss, this is can be problematic. Therefore, we present a preliminary workshop with four children and young people with sight loss in order to begin investigating how this population learns about social robots for the first time, their overall impressions of social robots, and whether games could assist in creating positive first-time interactions. Our initial findings reveal the importance of promoting tactile exploration, clarifying safety aspects, and careful consideration of the communication of robot emotion.},

abstract = {Physical touch (e.g., hugging, holding hands, petting an animal) plays a fundamental role in the provision of socio-emotional support. Touch-based interactions should thus be considered for socially assistive robots designed to provide similar support. However, the haptic properties of currently existing robots are limited. While research has shown possibilities of integrating life-like haptic cues (e.g., thermal, vibrotactile, pressure cues) into robotic interfaces, current understanding of user experiences with life-like haptic cues delivered by a robot, and their potential to regulate user affect, is insufficient. The current and proposed works investigate whether integrating life-like haptic cues into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) can enhance the socio-emotional support provided by socially assistive robots and improve the relationships with, and perceptions of such robots. The findings of this work will provide insights into user experiences of touching a socially assistive robot and their perceptions of life-like haptic cues. The contributions will provide concrete design suggestions on how haptic cues can be integrated into interfaces of socially assistive robots to enhance users' well-being during stress-inducing situations},

We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions.

The selected design scenarios reveal practices that violate principles of responsible smart home design. Through our analysis we show (1) how participants explore sensor-driven objectification of the home then leverage data for surveillance, nudging, and control over others; (2) how the dominant technosolutionist narratives of efficiency and productivity ground such questionable values; (3) and how the materiality of mass-produced sensors pre-mediates questionable design scenarios. We discuss how to attend to and utilize questionable values in design: Making space for questionable values will empower design researchers to better “look around corners”, anticipating tomorrow's concerns and forestalling the worst of their harms.},

The academic literature has, for example, highlighted the dangers of black-box decision-making and biased datasets. Furthermore, end-users’ ability to validate a system’s performance often disappears following the introduction of AI decision-making. We present the MAP model to understand and describe the three stages through which medical observations are interpreted and handled by AI systems. These stages are Measurement, in which information is gathered and converted into data points that can be stored and processed; Algorithm, in which computational processes transform the collected data; and Presentation, where information is returned to the user for interpretation. For each stage, we highlight possible challenges that need to be overcome to develop Human-Centred AI systems. We illuminate our MAP model through complementary case studies on colonoscopy practice and dementia diagnosis, providing examples of the challenges encountered in real-world settings. By defining Human-AI interaction across these three stages, we untangle some of the inherent complexities in designing AI technology for clinical decision-making, and aim to overcome misalignment between medical end-users and AI researchers and developers.},

Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) can be a useful participatory modeling tool that enables aggregation of individual perspectives to build system models that represent groups’ collective intelligence (CI). However, current FCM aggregation methodologies for creating CI models have rarely been tested and compared. We conducted 51 FCM interviews with local experts in the Flint, MI food system to map their mental models about how different food system sectors influenced desirable outcomes. Using four differing aggregation techniques, based on experts’ identity diversity and cognitive diversity, we generated four CI models. The models were compared based on their similarity to real-world complex systems using performance metrics like network structure, micro-motifs, cognitive distance, and scenario outcomes. We found that using cognitive diversity to group individuals was better suited for modeling systems with diverse holders of knowledge.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Shareish web platform to foster mutual aid following principles of gift economy and generalized exchange. Its design is grounded in prior work (in CT, CSCW, and solidarity HCI) and it aims at leveraging community assets through donation, free loan, requests of goods and services, and free event announcements. Authenticated users can visualize localized items on a map or through lists, search with filters, add new content with rich textual and visual descriptions, discuss about specific content with others users, and get notifications when new content is created in their neighborhood. In addition, we evaluate AI technologies to ease content creation. The platform can be easily replicated and improved by grassroots movements or researchers seeking autonomy as its source code is made freely available and its installation relies on modern deployment strategies. A demonstration server is available (https://shareish.org/, see Section Online Resources).},

abstract = {This paper reports on the ACM SPLASH 2022 conference panel on the Software Profession Dimensions of DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion]. The panelists observed that increased awareness for the dimensions of DEI will help reduce inequity in systems and technologies. The panel further observed that there are dimensions of diversity to consider beyond age, color, gender, and physical ability. As technologists, we need to leverage diverse talents and perspectives, including by those who may not have in-depth domain knowledge or a university education specific to computer science or engineering. Panelists included academic researchers and industry practitioners: experts in human-computer interaction, teamwork, AI applications, systems design, and gender diversity issues. The hybrid organization of the panel enabled participants from Taiwan and North America to join the in-room Australian and New Zealand panelists. Panelists explored a variety of related topics, ranging from how software can cause harm to the risks of "unconscious bias" in R&amp;D and the challenges of building diverse teams. Panelists shared observations that AI and ML systems can be negatively impacted by the bias inherent with inadequate or incomplete training data used to tune algorithms. The panel discussed and summarized questions to foster increased DEI awareness by software professionals, researchers, and community leaders.},

In this paper, we present clinicians' perspectives on the prospective benefits and harms of voice data collection during health consultations. Such data collection is being proposed as a means to power models to assist clinicians with medical data entry, administrative tasks, and consultation analysis. Yet, clinicians' attitudes and concerns are largely absent from the AI narratives surrounding these use cases, and the academic literature investigating them. Our qualitative interview study used the concept of an informed consent process as a type of design fiction, to support elicitation of clinicians' perspectives on voice data collection and use associated with a fictional, near-term AI assistant. Through reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth sessions with physicians, we distilled eight classes of potential risks that clinicians are concerned about, including workflow disruptions, self-censorship, and errors that could impact patient eligibility for services. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of these prospective risks, reflect on the use of the speculative processes that illuminated them, and reconsider evaluation criteria for AI-assisted clinical documentation technologies in light of our findings.},

abstract = {Language models are increasingly attracting interest from writers. However, such models lack long-range semantic coherence, limiting their usefulness for longform creative writing. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations—including plagiarism and bias—and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools.},

However, implementing digital transformation initiatives can be challenging, particularly in the public sector where processes and systems can be complex and bureaucratic, and as there no clear step-by-step guidelines to achieve a systematic, rigorous and repeatable result. The present paper aims at offering a valuable contribution to the field of digital transformation in the public sector, providing a practical and effective algorithmic method for business process reengineering and service digitalisation. The presented algorithmic approach to support the digital transformation of public sector services utilises process modelling tools, design patterns, innovative heuristics, simulation software and decision support systems. The method is demonstrated through a case study which involved the redesign of several hundreds of both internal processes and outward looking services in Greek local administration. Application results show significant improvements in process efficiency and effectiveness, repeatability and increased stakeholder satisfaction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel framework, that is, Mobile Freeze-Net along with Attention-based Loss Function, for Covid-19 detection from a Chest X-Ray (CXR) dataset. First, we have observed that by freezing 50% of a Mobile Net-V2 model (means fine-tuning 50% layers from ImageNet dataset) has automatically removed the class imbalance problem from the CXR dataset considerably. We call this 50% frozen Mobile Net-V2 model as Mobile Freeze-Net. Secondly, we have proposed an Attention-based Loss function, which provides more attention to the class, having higher inter-class similarity. We have computed attention weights for each class from the statistical inference of the dataset itself, by employing a Monte-Carlo method and thereafter, we have incorporated those weights into WCCE loss function of Mobile Freeze-Net model. By utilizing Mobile freeze-Net, we have achieved testing accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall of 93%, 94%, 93% and 94% respectively. This is approximately 3-4% improvement compared to 100% fine tuning of Mobile-Net V2. Furthermore, we have achieved approximate 1-2% improvement of Mobile Freeze-Net, after incorporating Attention-based Loss function. For the validity of the proposed framework, we have conducted experiments with 10-fold cross validation. All these experimental results suggest that our proposed framework has outperformed other existing models considerably.},

We held a workshop with four experienced practitioners to generate initial categories, and then coded the remaining decks. We found that the cards contain seven different types of design knowledge: Creative Inspiration; Human Insights; Material &amp; Domain; Methods &amp; Tooling; Problem Definition; Team Building; and Values in Practice. The content of these cards can support designers across design stages; however, most are intended to support the early stages of design (e.g., research and ideation) rather than later design stages (e.g., prototyping and implementation). We share additional patterns uncovered and provide recommendations to support the future development and adoption of these tools.},

This survey and systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis on robotic vision in human-robot interaction and collaboration (HRI/C) over the past 10&nbsp;years. From a detailed search of 3,850 articles, systematic extraction and evaluation was used to identify and explore 310 papers in depth. These papers described robots with some level of autonomy using robotic vision for locomotion, manipulation, and/or visual communication to collaborate or interact with people. This article provides an in-depth analysis of current trends, common domains, methods and procedures, technical processes, datasets and models, experimental testing, sample populations, performance metrics, and future challenges. Robotic vision was often used in action and gesture recognition, robot movement in human spaces, object handover and collaborative actions, social communication, and learning from demonstration. Few high-impact and novel techniques from the computer vision field had been translated into HRI/C. Overall, notable advancements have been made on how to develop and deploy robots to assist people.},

abstract = {Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of 'human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for 'critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.},

These threads often began as casual conversations among friends or lovers they met offline or online. The conversations evolved into sharing negative experiences about everyday stress (e.g., school, dating) to severe mental health disclosures (e.g., suicide). Disclosures were usually reciprocated with relatable experiences and positive peer support. We also discovered unsupport as a theme, where conversation members denied giving support, a unique finding in the online social support literature. We discuss the role of social media-based private channels and their implications for design in supporting youth’s mental health.

Systematic reviews, a staple of many disciplines, play an important and often essential role in how each field contributes to human knowledge. On this prospect, we argue that our meta-level approach to research within HCI needs a revolution. First, we echo previous calls for greater rigour in primary research reporting with a view towards supporting knowledge synthesis in secondary research. Second, we must decide as a community how to carry out systematic review work in light of the many ways that knowledge is produced within HCI (rigour in secondary research methods and epistemological inclusivity). In short, our manifesto is this: we need to develop and make space for an inclusive but rigorous set of standards that supports systematic review work in HCI, through careful consideration of both primary and secondary research methods, expectations, and infrastructure. We call for any and all fellow systematic review-lutionaries to join us.},

abstract = {Deep learning–based video analytics demands high network bandwidth to ferry the large volume of data when deployed on the cloud. When incorporated at the edge side, only lightweight deep neural network (DNN) models are affordable due to computational constraint. In this article, a cloud–edge collaborative architecture is proposed combining edge-based inference with cloud-assisted continuous learning. Lightweight DNN models are maintained at the edge servers and continuously retrained with a more comprehensive model on the cloud to achieve high video analytics performance while reducing the amount of data transmitted between edge servers and the cloud. The proposed design faces the challenge of constraints of both computation resources at the edge servers and network bandwidth of the edge–cloud links. An accuracy gradient-based resource allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate the limited computation and network resources across different video streams to achieve the maximum overall performance. A prototype system is implemented and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with up to 28.6% absolute mean average precision gain compared with alternative designs.},

A performative approach to human-robot interaction favors the artefact's relational, participatory capacities over representational attributes to explore the meaning-making potential of human-machine couplings rather than the predefined meaning of an individual robotic agent. We discuss the feminist concepts of intra-action and diffraction and explore how they could expand our understanding of the workings of the interference patterns that characterize human-robot relationships. Our collaborative Machine Movement Lab project serves as a case study to look at the situated enactment of the subjects and objects that shape our human-robot relationships through the embodied lens of performance-making.},

abstract = {Human activity, economic and non-economic, is a core driver of global climate change. With urban areas as the epicentre of human activity, cities are simultaneously the greatest contributors and the best opportunities for addressing global climate change and sustaining – even enhancing – planetary wellbeing. Therefore, city-based, stakeholder-inclusive, and evidence-informed solutions could constitute a meaningful inquiry for sustainable development. Enduring, evolving, and emerging concepts of civic engagement, smart urbanism, and urban play demonstrate such promise, albeit with several caveats. This study investigates the use of gamified, digital tools in supporting the co-creation of more sustainable cities, through a systematic review, a structured precedent analysis, as well as a small group app trial and playtest of a mobile pervasive game called CO2rdinates. CO2rdinates is developed as a hybrid tool combining climate action, citizen participation, smart city technology, and playability, and proposed as a part of a holistic response to urban sustainability challenges. Participants of the app trial were generally supportive of the development of gamified tools for co-creating sustainable cities, and most felt that the CO2rdinates app could motivate and facilitate them in doing so. Several participants further expressed that the app could integrate into a wider campaign to promote sustainability awareness and action. However, the study also highlighted key challenges in the use of the CO2rdinates app, and, more broadly, the deployment of gamified digital tools for sustainability-informed, playful, and participatory city-making processes. These include a better integration of the three challenges in the CO2rdinates gameplay, and concerns about potential disputes among stakeholders. This study demonstrates that gamified digital participatory tools can constitute an empathetic, effective response to urban sustainability challenges through stimulating curiosity and learning, as well as facilitating action. There is scope for future work to integrate a wider range of stakeholders in the app trial and development, and to create more cohesively integrated yet inclusively varied game architectures and narratives. Strategies to mitigate, or even facilitate mutual learning from, conflicting views and interests, are also important future considerations.},

Driven by social and economic forces affecting service delivery, these new technologies have transformed the labor that acts as the backbone to the industry-namely frontline service work performed by housekeepers, front desk staff, line cooks and others. We describe the context for recent technological adoption, with particular emphasis on algorithmic management applications. Through this work, we identify gaps in existing literature and highlight areas in need of further research in the domains of worker-centered technology development. Our analysis highlights how technologies such as algorithmic management shape roles and tasks in the high-touch service sector. We outline how harms produced through automation are often due to a lack of attention to non-management stakeholders. We then describe an opportunity space for researchers and practitioners to elicit worker participation at all stages of technology adoption, and offer methods for centering workers, increasing transparency, and accounting for the context of use through holistic implementation and training strategies.},

However, little is still known about how these factors interact. This paper presents a user study (N = 267) investigating the individual and combined effects of explanations, human oversight, and contestability on informational and procedural fairness perceptions for high- and low-stakes decisions in a loan approval scenario. We find that explanations and contestability contribute to informational and procedural fairness perceptions, respectively, but we find no evidence for an effect of human oversight. Our results further show that both informational and procedural fairness perceptions contribute positively to overall fairness perceptions but we do not find an interaction effect between them. A qualitative analysis exposes tensions between information overload and understanding, human involvement and timely decision-making, and accounting for personal circumstances while maintaining procedural consistency. Our results have important design implications for algorithmic decision-making processes that meet decision subjects’ standards of justice.},

abstract = {Citizens can increase openness, transparency, and accountability of institutions by taking part in face-to-face participatory policy-making deliberations, such as participatory budgeting assemblies. But for participants’ contributions to influence policy outcomes, organizers need to capture and synthesize participants’ input. Existing approaches are not inclusive for participants or require too much time from organizers. We designed e-scribing, a novel approach for capturing and synthesizing participants’ input from face-to-face deliberations in real time by combining scribes with digital technology. To evaluate the approach, we built DeliberationWorks, a digital deliberation technology that helps scribes (a) capture proxy input (i.e., as participants) that is complete and accurate so that participants do not need to interact with technology themselves and (b) synthesize the discussion in real time using labels. We deployed DeliberationWorks with 5 scribes in two face-to-face deliberations with 8-10 participants and found that, on average, 82% of the input was captured mostly accurately. After one hour of training, scribes synthesized input within 10 minutes of the end of the deliberation. Our findings suggest that e-scribing makes participatory policy-making more inclusive by allowing participants to share their input without interacting with technology, and more time-efficient by reducing synthesis and training times for organizers.},

abstract = {Economically disadvantaged migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable groups in healthcare. Studies have shown that chatbots can help patients and health professionals in healthcare settings. However, the design of health chatbots for migrant workers has not been thoroughly investigated. Scenario-based interviews with nineteen participants, including ten economically disadvantaged Thai migrant workers and nine relevant stakeholders, were conducted to examine how they seek healthcare, obtain health information, and communicate with health professionals to gain a deeper understanding of the barriers that migrant workers encounter in healthcare. The findings of the interview show that migrant workers face a variety of barriers, such as a lack of familiarity with the healthcare system in the host country, language barriers, cultural barriers to seeking healthcare, and communication barriers with health professionals. Then, the technological design strategies and the benefits of health chatbots from the perspective of migrant workers were discussed, including their potential to help migrant workers navigate the healthcare system step-by-step, obtain reliable health information, improve their health literacy, and facilitate communication with health professionals. Finally, five design implications for chatbots were proposed to guide future development of health chatbots to help migrant workers. Policymakers and health professionals can benefit from the design implications of migrant worker-centered health chatbots when they develop health chatbots that promote the health and well-being of migrant workers.},

However, user engagement depends to a large extent to which OGD platforms deliver in terms of information expectations of the user. In this vein, the significance of “information scent”, i.e. the propensity of a user to dig deeper into a web portal based on the quality aligned with the intrinsic goal of the user, assumes importance for facilitating optimum user engagement with the OGD portal. Drawing inferences from the experts’ opinion, this study seeks to present possible research themes around this edifice. Given that OGD-research has underscored the need for website maintenance in terms of provisioning quality OGD and conducive portal features for furthering user engagement, the significance of information scent via OGD portals for consistent user engagement merits consideration for furthering the contours of OGD literature.},

abstract = {Nonverbal sound offers great potential to enhance robots’ interactions with humans, and a growing body of research has begun to explore nonverbal sound for tasks such as sound source localization, explicit communication, and improving sociability. However, nonverbal sound has a broad interpretation and design space that can draw from areas such as machine learning, music theory, and foley. We sought to identify and compare use cases and approaches for nonverbal sound in human-robot interaction through a systematic review. A search of sound and robotics-related publisher databases yielded 148 peer-reviewed articles presenting systems, studies, and taxonomies. Differences in taxonomy and overlap of terminology with adjacent research fields such as speech, gaze, and gesture posed difficulties for the search, which we attempted to address through a multi-stage search process. Based on the reviewed articles, we developed a pair of taxonomies using scientific communication principles and analyzed study designs and measures for the creation of nonverbal robot sound. We discuss recommendations for the field, including the use of the new taxonomies; methods for design, generation, and validation; and paths for future research. Roboticists may benefit from incorporating nonverbal sound as a key component in multimodal human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {Many children are growing up in a “digital-by-default” world, where technologies mediate many of their interactions. There is emerging consensus that those who design technology must support children's privacy and security. However, privacy and security are complex concepts that are challenging to design for, and centering the interests of children is similarly difficult. Through a document analysis of 90 HCI publications, we examine what problems and solutions designing for children's privacy and security addresses and how this research engages with children. Applying Solove's privacy taxonomy, we find that research addresses a range of problems related to information collection, processing, dissemination, and invasion at the organizational, system, and individual levels. Children's participation in this research is largely limited to providing feedback rather than helping to guide the research itself. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for designers to sharpen their privacy and security contributions and center children in their work.},

abstract = {The apprenticeship model of learning, while valuable in facilitating direct expert supervision, lacks flexibility, timeliness, and feedback diversity, especially in high-stakes healthcare training (e.g., residency programs) where teaching resources are limited. An example healthcare domain is radiation oncology, where residents learn from attending physicians how to contour tumors that require radiotherapy treatment. This paper explores the current apprenticeship strategies in radiation oncology, proposes designs, and develops a prototype to enhance the transfer of knowledge from experts to residents. We introduce three feedback mechanisms comprising visual and text-based elements that outline the degree of overlap with expert contour, specific guidance on over- and under-contoured regions, and long-term toxicity for tumors and nearby organs at risk. The design strategies of this work can inform the design of other learning platforms (in healthcare and beyond) to improve the delivery and access of expert feedback in apprenticeship models.},

For this, we interviewed experts, who proposed tools for different stakeholders and scenarios. Important stakeholders of such tools are people with cognitive impairments and non-native readers. Frequently mentioned scenarios are public administration, the medical domain, and everyday life. The tools proposed by experts support stakeholders by improving how text is compressed, expanded, reviewed, and experienced. In a survey of stakeholders, we confirm that the scenarios are relevant and that the proposed tools appear helpful to them. We provide the Accessible Text Framework to help researchers understand how the different tools can be combined and discuss how individual tools can be implemented. The investigation shows that accessible text tools are an important HCI+AI challenge that a large number of people can benefit from.},

However, attempting to handle identity characteristics raises a number of critical ethical concerns, especially given the spatiotemporal dynamics of these characteristics. In this paper I question whether human identity characteristics can and should be represented, recognized, or reasoned about by robots, with special attention paid to the construct of race, due to its relative lack of consideration within the HRI community. As I will argue, while there are a number of well-warranted reasons why HRI researchers might want to enable robotic consideration of identity characteristics, these reasons are outweighed by a number of key ontological, perceptual, and deployment-oriented concerns. This argument raises troubling questions as to whether robots should even be able to understand or generate descriptions of people, and how they would do so while avoiding these ethical concerns. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of what this means for the HRI community, in terms of both algorithm and robot design, and speculate as to possible paths forward.},

abstract = {We explored the use of digital stories to support empathy skills training in maternity health workers. Our digital stories build on an existing in-person training approach; the Secret History (SH) that was developed by the Perinatal Mental Health Project. During SH training, health workers are invited to enact scenarios with patients, examining their reactions and responses as they learn more about the "history" of their patients and of their assumed characters as health workers. This training has resulted in improvement in empathic skills for health workers, but opportunities to scale the intervention are limited. The SH is costly to implement, requiring in-person workshops and facilitator training for small groups of workers. Our mobile application may either supplement or introduce the SH concepts at scale to health workers. The stories have been co-designed with mental health experts, midwives, and other trainers, and employ a "choose-your-own-adventure" approach, slowly revealing the histories of the characters, as in the original SH protocol. To inform decisions of the app design, data was collected through interviews, co-design workshops and focus group discussions as detailed in the methods section.},

Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.},

abstract = {Many industries are facing the challenge of how to capture workers’ knowledge such that it can be shared, in particular tacit knowledge. The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines.},

With a view to addressing this inequality, there exists a wide range of interventions that researchers have explored to bridge this accessibility gap. Despite this work, our understanding of the capability of these interventions is poor. In this paper, we address this through a systematic review of the literature, creating a dataset of and analysing N = 181 scientific papers. We have found that certain areas have accrued a disproportionate amount of attention from the research community – for example, blind and visually impaired and d/Deaf and hard of hearing people account for of papers (N = 170). We describe challenges researchers have addressed, end-user communities of focus, and interventions examined. We conclude by evaluating gaps in the literature and areas that could use more focus on in the future.},

A deductive thematic analysis has been conducted to analyse these functionalities in terms of collective intelligence (CI) components (namely staffing, processes, goals, and motivation) based on a most recent generic CI model. The functionalities were further evaluated by experts working in the field of science and technology in the silver economy. Overall, this article offers insights into the functionalities that are required for a digital collaborative platform to support the elderly population and facilitate co-creation among quadruple helix actors, as well as provides a foundation for future work on designing and implementing such a platform.},

This work succeeds a fine-grained investigation about the attitudes of the Guild Wars 2 community regarding balancing factors, and introduces a player-driven quantitative tool to approximate closer configurations of balance that could optimize player experience and satisfaction. After an initial evaluation, theoretical constellation outputs of this tool improved players’ perception of the balance between in-game build options – where aggregated opinions of (n = 64) players even showed benefits over individual opinions, indicating a potential “wisdom of the crowd” effect.},

We analyse a total of 181 illustrations from 137 papers to understand the diverse ways in which robot movements are illustrated as well as how each style supports and limits information about the movements. We identify 10 basic styles that are used. Based on a visual analysis of these styles, we provide a detailed examination of each. This paper contributes with an overview that can be used to support future dissemination within the HRI research community. We present four aspects to consider for future illustrations and a discussion on how our findings could be utilised in early design processes.},

Transparency, however, has yet to be scrutinized to the same degree as accountability and fairness. As a result, we don't know: What does this community mean when it talks about transparency? How are we doing transparency? And to what ends? What commitments does (or should) the T in FAccT signify? This paper interrogates the T in FAccT using perspectives from critical transparency literature. Subsequently, we argue that FAccT might be better off dropping the T from its title for two reasons: (1) transparency can often be counterproductive to FAccT's primary objectives and (2) it is misleading as FAccT is mainly preoccupied with explainability rather than actual transparency. If we want to keep the T, we need to reframe how we think about and do transparency by making transparency contingent, reclaiming it from explainability, and bringing people into transparency processes.},

abstract = {The emergence of the metaverse has expanded the vital role of virtual worlds in education. It extends the traditional configuration of virtual spaces by offering a more immersive, interactive, and social experience. Unfortunately, there is insufficient literature on how to develop a metaverse application aligned with academic standards and best practices. In this study, we adopted a co-design approach in remodeling our mobile educational metaverse to draw a blueprint for existing and future metaverse technology adopters. We sent a follow-up survey to stakeholders inviting free-text comments. This survey focused on the challenges, issues, and expected features from the perspectives of developers, teachers, and students, respectively. Our results revealed several challenges that developers face when building a metaverse, such as technical infrastructure, student engagement, avatar customization, and performance optimization. Meanwhile, teachers emphasized potential issues that may arise from the use of metaverse technology in educational settings, such as learning outcomes, health and safety, digital citizenship, and ethics and morality. Finally, students expected several key features of an educational metaverse application, such as socialization and collaboration, virtual world interactions, metaverse optimization, realistic graphics, and minigames and activities. The implications of these findings are significant and can help other educational institutions seeking to integrate metaverse technology into their academic services. Overall, our study presents an initial foundation for further exploration and advancement within the rapidly evolving field of metaverse technology.},

abstract = {As the HRI field evolves, the way we understand, and study human-robot interaction also inevitably changes. We argue here that there has been a gradual shift in HRI research from investigating a concept of human-robot 'interaction' towards that of 'experience'. This includes User Experience (UX) approaches in the first place, but also those perspectives that begin to go beyond mere usability and optimization toward meaningful social interactions and social experiences. This paper addresses the shift in question from a sociological perspective and proposes to bring it even further to include a systematic study of human 'lived experiences' taking place in the community contexts. The ultimate goal is to facilitate theoretical and methodological developments needed to systematically address and pursue research on the 'HRI of Everyday Life'.},

Several organizations and communities are responding to this call by sharing RAI guidelines. However, there are gaps in awareness, deliberation, and execution of such practices for multi-disciplinary ML practitioners. This work contributes to the discussion by unpacking co-production challenges faced by practitioners as they align their RAI values. We interviewed 23 individuals, across 10 organizations, tasked to ship AI/ML based products while upholding RAI norms and found that both top-down and bottom-up institutional structures create burden for different roles preventing them from upholding RAI values, a challenge that is further exacerbated when executing conflicted values. We share multiple value levers used as strategies by the practitioners to resolve their challenges. We end our paper with recommendations for inclusive and equitable RAI value-practices, creating supportive organizational structures and opportunities to further aid practitioners.},

abstract = {Recently, an increasing number of safety organizations in the U.S. have incorporated text-based risk reporting systems to respond to safety incident reports from their community members. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between community members and dispatchers using text-based risk reporting systems, this study conducts a system log analysis ofLiveSafe, a community safety reporting system, to provide empirical evidence of the conversational patterns between users and dispatchers using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We created an ontology to capture information (e.g., location, attacker, target, weapon, start-time, and end-time, etc.) that dispatchers often collected from users regarding their incident tips. Applying the proposed ontology, we found that dispatchers often asked users for different information across varied event types (e.g.,Attacker forAbuse andAttack events,Target forHarassment events). Additionally, using emotion detection and regression analysis, we found an inconsistency in dispatchers' emotional support and responsiveness to users' messages between different organizations and between incident categories. The results also showed that users had a higher response rate and responded quicker when dispatchers provided emotional support. These novel findings brought significant insights to both practitioners and system designers, e.g., AI-based solutions to augment human agents' skills for improved service quality.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems underpin many of our society’s critical infrastructures. Ensuring their cyber security is important and complex. A major activity in this regard is cyber security incident response, whose primary goal is to detect and mitigate cyber-attacks in order to ensure the continuity and resilience of services. For cyber-physical systems this is particularly challenging because it requires insights both from the cyber and physical (process) domains and the engagement of stakeholders that are not strictly concerned with cyber security. A technology that is receiving a lot of attention are digital twins – virtual representations of real-world (cyber-physical) systems. They can be used to support tasks such as estimating the state of a system and exploring the consequences of interventional activities (e.g., upgrades). In this paper, we examine the use of digital twins to support cyber security. Specifically, our novel contribution is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the types of activities and how different modalities of digital twin use can be applied to the phases of cyber security incident response. Building on this analysis, we propose a structured approach to enhancing cyber security playbooks for cyber-physical systems incident response with digital twins. Playbooks are an essential component of incident response, ensuring that multi-disciplinary teams are effective in responding to cyber security incidents; therefore, improvements in their execution can result in increased resilience. To illustrate our approach, we present its use for a playbook that is concerned with mitigating a cyber-attack to critical industrial equipment.},

abstract = {Social change projects, such as those undertaken under the banner of information &amp; communication technologies for development (ICT4D), frequently address problems using a design-based approach and therefore inherit the values of what could be called “classical design.” One of those values, as we demonstrate through an examination of popular design textbooks, is to accommodate people’s needs, abilities, and behaviors. Accommodating people as they are, however, is very different from encouraging the internal changes in people – as either individuals or societies – that are required for meaningful social change. The inclinations of classical design are thus poorly matched to efforts intended to lead to social change. We flesh out this argument through an examination of classical design’s underlying ethos, an articulation of the difference between social good and social change, case studies of three ICT4D design efforts, and analysis of the implications of “giving people what they want.” We conclude with a call to draw a clear line between design for convenience or efficiency and innovation for social change in ICT4D pedagogy, research, and practice.},

Drawing upon findings from a two-year ethnography conducted at a child welfare agency, we highlight how algorithmic systems are embedded within a complex decision-making ecosystem at critical points of the child welfare process. Caseworkers interact with algorithms in their daily lives where they must collect information about families and feed it to algorithms to make critical decisions. We show how the interplay between systemic mechanics and algorithmic decision-making can adversely impact the fairness of the decision-making process itself. We show how functionality issues in algorithmic systems can lead to process-oriented harms where they adversely affect the nature of professional practice, and administration at the agency, and lead to inconsistent and unreliable decisions at the street level. In addition, caseworkers are compelled to undertake additional labor in the form of repair work to restore disrupted administrative processes and decision-making, all while facing organizational pressures and time and resource constraints. Finally, we share the case study of a simple algorithmic tool that centers caseworkers’ decision-making within a trauma-informed framework and leads to better outcomes, however, required a significant amount of investments on the agency’s part in creating the ecosystem for its proper use.},

In a Research through Design study involving autonomous shuttle buses in public transport, we explored sound design with the help of voice-overs to video recordings of the buses on the road and Wizard-of-Oz tests in live traffic. The buses are slowed down by (unnecessary) braking in response to people getting close. We found that prolonged jingles draw attention to the bus and invite interaction, while repeated short beeps and bell sounds can instruct the movement of others away from the bus. We highlight the importance of designing sound in sequential interaction and describe a new method for embedding video interaction analysis in the design process.},

The use of MSEs is usually carried out with the collaboration of teachers; their perspectives and responsibilities are crucial for the children’s experience.

In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 27 AI ethics toolkits to critically examine how the work of ethics is imagined and how it is supported by these toolkits. Specifically, we examine the discourses toolkits rely on when talking about ethical issues, who they imagine should do the work of ethics, and how they envision the work practices involved in addressing ethics. Among the toolkits, we identify a mismatch between the imagined work of ethics and the support the toolkits provide for doing that work. In particular, we identify a lack of guidance around how to navigate labor, organizational, and institutional power dynamics as they relate to performing ethical work. We use these omissions to chart future work for researchers and designers of AI ethics toolkits.},

These and other causes may lead to the discontinuation and even abandonment of initiatives. Since seemingly failed projects are much more difficult to publish as articles, this workshop will provide academics and practitioners with a rare opportunity to exchange experiences and insights on discontinued civic tech initiatives. The goal of the workshop is to develop a better understanding of why some civic tech initiatives fail and ask whether discontinued initiatives may still somehow contribute to social change and the growth of digital civics. A variety of sub-questions around discontinued civic tech will be addressed in the workshop, including matters of participation, citizen science, public management, power structures and biases, and communication.},

abstract = {This essay investigates the complex relationship between digital technologies and social participation, focusing on the challenges and opportunities the technosphere presents. Utilizing Twitter as a case study, the essay critically examines the power dynamics, values, and interests that shape the design and implementation of digital technologies and their impact on social participation. The framework presented in this essay identifies two interconnected layers of social participation in the digital context: 1) employing technology as a tool for social participation and 2) actively engaging in the construction and political dynamics of technology itself. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the study argues that the current privatization of the technosphere and its governance by a few powerful corporations poses significant threats to democracy, equity, and the public interest. The essay claims strategies for fostering democratic engagement within the technosphere, such as developing public digital infrastructure, implementing transparency and accountability measures, and empowering civil society. By actively involving diverse stakeholders in developing, governance, and evaluating digital technologies, this essay advocates for a more inclusive and democratic technosphere that genuinely serves the public interest. This essay contributes to the academic discourse on the role of digital technologies in shaping our social, political, and economic lives and calls for further interdisciplinary research to explore the technosphere for democratic participation. By critically examining and addressing the power dynamics inherent in digital technologies, we can work towards a more inclusive, equitable, and democratic digital ecosystem.},

Generally, studies on future of work and changes digitalization brings to work practice focus is often in in-organization issues, leaving the larger context and external actors unstudied. We take the higher-level viewpoint, asking what kind of actors and factors have an effect in the change in the trucking work practice, and what kind of involvement the actors have in the change. We analyzed 40 interviews, utilizing User Involvement Centered Design model as our lens, and created an illustrative case for the trucking industry to make visible how a collection of decisions, designs, and digital solutions affect the work practice of truck drivers.},

abstract = {Users are increasingly empowered to personalize natural language interfaces (NLIs) by teaching how to handle new natural language (NL) inputs. However, our formative study found that when teaching new NL inputs, users require assistance in clarifying ambiguities that arise and want insight into which parts of the input the NLI understands. In this paper we introduce ONYX, an intelligent agent that interactively learns new NL inputs by combining NL programming and programming-by-demonstration, also known as multi-modal interactive task learning. To address the aforementioned challenges, ONYX provides suggestions on how ONYX could handle new NL inputs based on previously learned concepts or user-defined procedures, and poses follow-up questions to clarify ambiguities in user demonstrations, using visual and textual aids to clarify the connections. Our evaluation shows that users provided with ONYX’s new features achieved significantly higher accuracy in teaching new NL inputs (median: 93.3%) in contrast to those without (median: 73.3%).},

abstract = {Mental health problems are a serious concern among university students, and international students in Canada are known to be particularly vulnerable due to the underutilization of mental health services and unfamiliarity with Western approaches to mental health. However, international students' mental well-being remains underexplored in HCI. In this study, we conducted remote synchronous remote co-design sessions with 19 participants (14 international students, 5 mental health professionals) to understand concretely what types of designs for interactive technologies suit these students' mental health needs and challenges. Based on their brainstormed ideas and sketches, we produced a set of design dimensions that span different types of support, interaction, and safety. The dimensions were then used to develop a set of four medium-fidelity mockups that spanned these dimensions, presenting a diverse range of design features. Using these mockups, we elicited feedback in an online survey from the same participants. Findings suggest that the students negotiate a complex understanding of helpfulness, comfort, and trust when they consider what types of designs to consider using. Each mockup highlights different ways to support individual differences and preferences. Our work serves as a foundation for designing technologies that can ease issues with accessibility and be more inclusive of international students' cultural backgrounds.},

abstract = {AI-based design tools are proliferating in professional software to assist engineering and industrial designers in complex manufacturing and design tasks. These tools take on more agentic roles than traditional computer-aided design tools and are often portrayed as “co-creators.” Yet, working effectively with such systems requires different skills than working with complex CAD tools alone. To date, we know little about how engineering designers learn to work with AI-based design tools. In this study, we observed trained designers as they learned to work with two AI-based tools on a realistic design task. We find that designers face many challenges in learning to effectively co-create with current systems, including challenges in understanding and adjusting AI outputs and in communicating their design goals. Based on our findings, we highlight several design opportunities to better support designer-AI co-creation.},

Through a co-design approach, we explored the potential for Smart City technology to create urban environments that are safe for women. We ran a set of online co-design sessions, starting with three mixed and then eight city-specific sessions with female-identifying persons from Berlin, Melbourne and Cairo. Through these, requirements of women for smart city technology were explored and analysed in connection to the contexts of the respective cities. We found that in terms of practical solutions, ideas are always bound to the local context of the city, to routines of women’s lifestyle, as well as to cultural specifics of the place. Nevertheless, general requirements for Smart City solutions across all cities similarly concern “Preventive measures”, “Reactive measures”, “Reporting support” and “Systematic changes”.},

My proposed future work will first quantitatively identify what algorithmic moderation design affects creators’ perceived transparency, fairness, and accountability of creator moderation across different platforms. Then, I will co-design with creators and commercial moderators from different platforms to rethink what and how creator moderation can take creators’ interests into account.

abstract = {Today, so-called persuasive or motivational technologies are developing, which refer to technologies, applications or services designed to induce changes in attitudes and behavior in those who use them. This is the subject of research in Human-Computer Interaction in connection with theories from psychology related, for example, to behavior change or motivation. Research on these technologies suggests that in order to encourage long-term adherence, these "virtual coaches" need to be personalized and/or tailored according to the individual characteristics of the users (stage of behavior change, motivations, preferences, barriers). For example, according to the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), an individual can present different forms of motivation, more or less effective. The idea is to be able to identify the forms of motivation present in users in order to propose services to reinforce or develop them. The use of such systems in the field of health has the potential to induce and reinforce health behaviors that are sometimes difficult to establish by health professionals. Providing daily, personalized care represents a considerable human and financial cost for health professionals. A mobile application has the advantage of being able to deal with these constraints. The computer coach is designed with and for patients suffering from chronic low back pain. The aim is to help them manage their condition, particularly with regard to their pain and the practice of regular physical activity. The work presented presents an innovative design approach, combining user-centered methodologies and psychological theories, which we detail through a research phase and a design phase. Currently, a first version of the application has been developed and is being tested.},

abstract = {Computational modeling plays an important role in scientific research and education. However, many models do not communicate with the real world, which might limit their learning potential. In this proposal, we introduce the design of NetLogo AR, an authoring toolkit that transforms NetLogo agent-based computational models into room-scale AR experiences. We are inspired by studies that integrate real-world environments into computational models, including bifocal modeling and participatory simulation, and those that leverage Augmented Reality (AR) to create authoring tools for children. We describe our design goals that focus on raising the ceiling and lowering the threshold for potential AR designers: researchers, educators, and children. For the IDC conference, we propose an example learning activity to demonstrate the capabilities of NetLogo AR. By incorporating dynamic and unpredictable real-world inputs, NetLogo AR has the potential to inspire future designs of AR experiences and enrich the learning experiences of agent-based models for children.},

abstract = {Autoscanning of an unknown environment is the key to many AR/VR and robotic applications. However, autonomous reconstruction with both high efficiency and quality remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a reconstruction-oriented autoscanning approach, called ScanBot, which utilizes hierarchical deep reinforcement learning techniques for global region-of-interest (ROI) planning to improve the scanning efficiency and local next-best-view (NBV) planning to enhance the reconstruction quality. Given the partially reconstructed scene, the global policy designates an ROI with insufficient exploration or reconstruction. The local policy is then applied to refine the reconstruction quality of objects in this region by planning and scanning a series of NBVs. A novel mixed 2D-3D representation is designed for these policies, where a 2D quality map with tailored quality channels encoding the scanning progress is consumed by the global policy, and a coarse-to-fine 3D volumetric representation that embodies both local environment and object completeness is fed to the local policy. These two policies iterate until the whole scene has been completely explored and scanned. To speed up the learning of complex environmental dynamics and enhance the agent's memory for spatial-temporal inference, we further introduce two novel auxiliary learning tasks to guide the training of our global policy. Thorough evaluations and comparisons are carried out to show the feasibility of our proposed approach and its advantages over previous methods.

abstract = {The advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has brought substantial progress in image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. However, most SR methods pursue deep architectures to boost performance, and the resulting large model sizes are impractical for real-world applications. Furthermore, they insufficiently explore the internal structural information of image features, disadvantaging the restoration of fine texture details. To solve these challenges, we propose a lightweight architecture based on a CNN named attention-directed feature aggregation network (AFAN), consisting of chained stacking multi-aware attention modules (MAAMs) and a simple channel attention module (SCAM), for image SR. Specifically, in each MAAM, we construct a space-aware attention block (SAAB) and a dimension-aware attention block (DAAB) that individually yield unique three-dimensional modulation coefficients to adaptively recalibrate structural information from an asymmetric convolution residual block (ACRB). The synergistic strategy captures multiple content features that are both space-aware and dimension-aware to preserve more fine-grained details. In addition, to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the network, SCAM is embedded in the last MAAM to highlight channels with high activated values at low computational load. Comprehensive experiments verify that our proposed network attains high qualitative accuracy while employing fewer parameters and moderate computational requirements, exceeding most state-of-the-art lightweight approaches.},

abstract = {Agriculture is foundational for food security on our planet. Considering climate change and other pressures on food production, HCI scholars have increasingly begun to examine how the field should approach agricultural innovation. We conducted a literature review of HCI research through the lens of competing future visions for good food systems : a “conventional” vision of profit-oriented production, and an “alternative” which prioritizes sustainability and community-led practices. Leveraging the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, we provide an empirical analysis of how HCI and adjacent applied computing projects align with these competing visions for agriculture. This review reveals, amongst other findings, a prioritization of the perspectives of the Global North and a need for more careful attention to the constraints and aspirations of subsistence farmers. Finally, we note the limits of the conventional-alternative binary that shapes much of contemporary HCI research focused on agriculture and offer opportunities for transcending this framing.},

abstract = {Within the last few decades, data science has risen towards the top of agendas in public services such as adult social care. Concomitant with this ever-increasing appetite for data science is an expanding catalogue of challenges associated with developing, deploying, and maintaining data science software: choosing the appropriate, if any, analytical technique to use; balancing competing conceptions of success; and sustaining user adoption. In my thesis, I argue that these are sociotechnical challenges: issues that arise in the tension between what people do, and how data science software supports, limits, and, crucially, changes what they do. Through design science research, this thesis will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a design approach for data science software that attempts to address such sociotechnical challenges. The empirical sites in which these research activities will take place are live data science projects with local government organisations responsible for adult social care services in England. The resultant approach will include a conceptual model for sociotechnical data science, process guidance and methods for applying the design approach, and results from applying the approach in a real-world data science project in collaboration with an industry partner.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons.},

abstract = {Homophily is a fundamental sociological theory that describes the tendency of individuals to interact with others who share similar attributes. This theory has shown evident relevance for studying collaborative learning and classroom orchestration in learning analytics research from a social constructivist perspective. Emerging advancements in multimodal learning analytics have shown promising results in capturing interaction data and generating socio-spatial analytics in physical learning spaces through computer vision and wearable positioning technologies. Yet, there are limited ways for analysing homophily (e.g., social network analysis; SNA), especially for unpacking the temporal connections between different homophilic behaviours. This paper presents a novel analytic approach, Social-epistemic Network Analysis (SeNA), for analysing homophily by combining social network analysis with epistemic network analysis to infuse socio-spatial analytics with temporal insights. The additional insights SeNA may offer over traditional approaches (e.g., SNA) were illustrated through analysing the homophily of 98 students in open learning spaces. The findings showed that SeNA could reveal significant behavioural differences in homophily between comparison groups across different learning designs, which were not accessible to SNA alone. The implications and limitations of SeNA in supporting future learning analytics research regarding homophily in physical learning spaces are also discussed.},

The temporal structure of past, present, and future situations in the field of attention played a significant role in the children’s experiences. This leads to design considerations for an explainable interior of self-driving buses.},

At present, there is a pressing need of synthesizing and extracting key insights from prior literature to formulate a systematic understanding of what constitutes a moderation experience and to explore how such understanding could further inform moderation-related research and practices. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by analyzing 42 empirical studies related to moderation experiences and published between January 2016 and March 2022. We describe these studies' characteristics and how they characterize users' moderation experiences. We further identify five primary perspectives that prior researchers use to conceptualize moderation experiences. These findings suggest an expansive scope of research interests in understanding moderation experiences and considering moderated users as an important stakeholder group to reflect on current moderation design but also pertain to the dominance of the punitive, solutionist logic in moderation and ample implications for future moderation research, design, and practice.},

abstract = {Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) lack resources, hindering the quality and quantity of service they can deliver. Meanwhile, NPOs at times have underutilized or even spare resources due to the inability to scale expertise in staffing and tangible resources to meet temporally shifting service demands. These observations motivate us to propose a novel resource sharing system, SWAP, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first resource sharing system that facilitates resource exchanges where NPOs can obtain resources by offering their own. SWAP consists of four elements: a collaborative auction-based sharing process, complete with an offering mechanism, a bidding mechanism, and the virtual currency, SWAPcredit, to facilitate liquidity in exchange; a central technology that represents the award determination problem with a multilateral exchange optimization model, generating resource exchange outcomes; an online platform, the SWAP Hub, where NPOs can offer and bid on available resources, and receive exchange results; and human-centric co-design, shaping the understanding and design decisions of a research collective, that includes the authors and NPO professionals. We conduct a series of experiments using both empirical and simulated data to illustrate the benefits and potential of SWAP. Our results demonstrate that SWAP can address temporal resource needs in practice; show that optimal exchange outcomes can be generated even for large-scale SWAP markets; and provide strong evidence in support of guidance to inform the progression for future versions of SWAP. The SWAP system is presently implemented in Howard County, MD, USA, with ongoing enhancements and potential for future expansion.},

SoundTraveller allows the user to explore the timbral space using two modes: evolutionary and morphing, with which they can generate hundreds of unique timbres without the need to edit individual parameters. Our user study confirmed that SoundTraveller supported participants’ exploration, decreased their cognitive load, and increased their perceived creativity. Through analysis of our interview study, we contribute design considerations for timbre exploration systems, and for exploring large aesthetic parameter spaces more generally. Finally, we discuss how systems like SoundTraveller can fit into the existing workflows of electronic music composers, and how shared agency with creative technologies can impact the creative process.},

abstract = {Many robot-delivered health interventions aim to support people longitudinally at home to complement or replace in-clinic treatments. However, there is little guidance on how robots can support collaborative goal setting (CGS). CGS is the process in which a person works with a clinician to set and modify their goals for care; it can improve treatment adherence and efficacy. However, for home-deployed robots, clinicians will have limited availability to help set and modify goals over time, which necessitates that robots support CGS on their own. In this work, we explore how robots can facilitate CGS in the context of our robot CARMEN (Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation), which delivers neurorehabilitation to people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). We co-designed robot behaviors for supporting CGS with clinical neuropsychologists and PwMCI, and prototyped them on CARMEN. We present feedback on how PwMCI envision these behaviors supporting goal progress and motivation during an intervention. We report insights on how to support this process with home-deployed robots and propose a framework to support HRI researchers interested in exploring this both in the context of cognitively assistive robots and beyond. This work supports designing and implementing CGS on robots, which will ultimately extend the efficacy of robot-delivered health interventions.},

This paper investigates how companies translate the GDPR and CCPA into business risks in documents created for investors. We conduct a qualitative document analysis of annual regulatory filings (Form 10-K) from nine major technology companies. We outline five ways that technology companies consider GDPR and CCPA as business risks, describing both direct and indirect ways that the legislation may affect their businesses. We highlight how these findings are relevant for the broader CSCW and privacy research communities in research, design, and practice. Creating meaningful privacy changes within existing institutional structures requires some understanding of the dynamics of these companies' decision-making processes and the role of capital.},

abstract = {Intelligent systems learn and evolve depending on what kinds of input are given and how people actually use them after deployment. While such a characteristic may be a troubling property for AI user experience designers, it also imbues an intelligent system with an open-ended quality, empowering end-users to ‘design’ their own system in use to achieve more desired experiences. In light of this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 16 users of various AI-based everyday recommender systems, investigating how people design their AI user experiences in actual use contexts. Exploring people’s current experiences of adopting and adapting those systems to achieve their own desired experiences, we discovered three styles of end-user design of their experiences: teaching, resisting, and repurposing. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings, recognizing end-users’ motivation to challenge a prescribed experience of an intelligent system.},

Today, social media platforms and their algorithms influence artful experiences for billions. How has this changed the appreciation and perception of art? The role of visual art as items we use to define ourselves and our societies motivates research to explore how recommendation algorithms impact our ability to appreciate and perceive art. There are three aspects to explore: the art metadata and algorithm functionality, conversations with artworld experts, and redesigning digital art experiences. These three methods will follow open science practices and methods by releasing open-access datasets and research prototypes. Ultimately, this proposed thesis aims to contribute to theories of content base algorithmic recommendation and its role in presenting art and culture to users.},

Our findings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as: 1) the tool's dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhancement of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limitations related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts.

To stay competitive in this growing technological industry segment, lowering costs while increasing productivity and shortening time-to-market will become increasingly important. Adopting Agile Software Development practices for IoT projects may provide this competitive advantage, as it enables organizations to respond to change, while being dynamic and innovative. Applying a mixed-methods approach, agile IoT practitioners around the world and from diverse industries were surveyed and interviewed. Our study recommends that Agile Software Development team makeup, practices, and methods should be tailored to the specific industry, culture, people, and IT application of an organization. People play an important role in the success of agile projects; therefore, our research focuses on identifying the critical attributes of agile teams to maximize success. Our study identified the five critical agile practices: Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Integration, Single Team, Dedicated Customer, and Sprint Planning and found that both technical and soft skills are essential for successful IoT development.},

This enhancement can be effectively achieved by using smart service systems that focus on value co-creation among all stakeholders. In general, these services have to be engineered in a special way tailored to the particular community and use case at hand. In this paper, we propose an engineering approach centered on the concept of the citizen developer for creating, maintaining and managing those smart services. By using a domain-specific modelling language specially tailored to the smart region context, we develop a platform capable of generating smart services from a high-level description including data sources, transformations and visualizations. This results in an efficient and cost-effective development approach where the stakeholders of the smart region context themselves lead the process of building, deploying and implementing the relevant use-cases for their communities.},

There is a need for tools and frameworks that help technologists become more aware of broader contexts of their work and engage in more responsible and inclusive practices. In this paper, we introduce an online card tool containing questions to scaffold critical reflection about projects’ impacts on society, business, and research. We present the iterative design of the Responsible &amp; Inclusive Cards and findings from five workshops (n=21 participants) with teams distributed across a multinational technology corporation, as well as interviews with people with disabilities to assess gameplay and mental models. We found the tool promoted discussions about challenging topics, reduced power gaps through democratized turn-taking, and enabled participants to identify concrete areas to improve their practice.},

abstract = {Sharing multimedia content, without obtaining consent from the people involved causes multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs). However, social-media platforms do not proactively protect users from the occurrence of MPCs. Hence, users resort to out-of-band, informal communication channels, attempting to mitigate such conflicts. So far, previous works have focused on hard interventions that do not adequately consider the contextual factors (e.g., social norms, cognitive priming) or are employed too late (i.e., the content has already been seen). In this work, we investigate the potential of conversational agents as a medium for negotiating and mitigating MPCs. We designed MediationBot, a mediator chatbot that encourages consent collection, enables users to explain their points of view, and proposes solutions to finding a middle ground. We evaluated our design using a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with N = 32 participants, where we found that MediationBot can effectively help participants to reach an agreement and to prevent MPCs. It produced a structured conversation where participants had well-clarified speaking turns. Overall, our participants found MediationBot to be supportive as it proposes useful middle-ground solutions. Our work informs the future design of mediator agents to support social-media users against MPCs.},

Empathy refers to the ability to sense other people’s emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what they might be thinking and feeling. Architectural and urban design have identified empathy as a crucial factor in the design process and especially in user-centered participatory methods. Although empathy has been recognized as important for relating to other people’s issues, current research has not explored how urban accessibility issues elicit empathy. We conducted a between-subjects online study where 202 participants observed five scenarios on different accessibility issues. Our results show that empathic traits and previous experience are significant factors in empathizing with accessibility issues. Additionally, storytelling and photos can influence perceptions of accessibility issues. The study highlights the importance of empathic traits and personal experience in understanding and addressing accessibility issues, as well as the potential of storytelling and photos in shaping perceptions of accessibility issues and evoking empathy. Our contribution demonstrates the advantages of incorporating narrative multimedia into design processes for improved urban accessibility.},

This article examines perceptions of harm and preferences for remedies associated with online harassment with nearly 4000 participants in 14 countries around the world. The countries in this work reflect a range of identities and values, with a focus on those outside of North American and European contexts. Results show that perceptions of harm are higher among participants from all countries studied compared to the United States. Non-consensual sharing of sexual photos is consistently rated as harmful in all countries, while insults and rumors are perceived as more harmful in non-U.S. countries, especially harm to family reputation. Lower trust in other people and lower trust in sense of safety in one’s neighborhood correlate with increased perceptions of harm of online harassment. In terms of remedies, participants in most countries prefer monetary compensation, apologies, and publicly revealing offender’s identities compared to the U.S. Social media platform design and policy must consider regional values and norms, which may depart from U.S. centric-approaches.},

At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.},

Unfortunately, both price and a lack of consideration of the needs of low-SES communities have made these devices inaccessible and unusable for communities that would most substantially benefit from their affordances. To address this gap and better understand how members of low-SES communities perceive the potential benefits and barriers to using wearable devices, we conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with people from minority, high crime rate, low-SES communities. Participants emphasized a critical need for safety-related wearable devices in their communities. Still, existing tools do not yet address the specific needs of this community and are out of reach due to several barriers. We distill themes on perceived useful features and ongoing obstacles to guide a much-needed research agenda we term ’Equityware’: building wearable devices based on low-SES communities’ needs, comfortability, and limitations.},

The images data conjure up, however, tend to be homogenous and flat: black screens, ones and zeros, big server farms in the desert. For designers and researchers who work with data as a material, this small repertoire can be stifling. For device users, it can lead to a removal of agency in how they make sense and engage with the data they produce. In this pictorial, we draw from a two-year data fictionalization project to start building an expanded repertoire of data imaginaries. We worked with seven households and seven writers to transform smart home data sets into fiction stories. Based on the interviews we conducted, we present the images participants shared with us as a step towards more expressive and varied imaginaries of data.},

Drawing on approaches within critical design and based on evidence from two different projects, we develop an approach, counterfactual actions, that moves beyond the creation of artifacts and towards more situated, embodied, and performative engagements. In one project, Reimaging Work, we used a participatory game to engage stakeholders from social and economic justice organizations in Chicago. The other project, Future Design Studio, invited audience members at a futurist festival to create artifacts from the future and then invited improvisational actors to build worlds around them. We argue that a focus on counterfactual actions supports a more relational approach to understanding the politics of socio-technical systems and infrastructures, allowing participants to gain a meaningful understanding of the ways in which technology could be designed otherwise in line with ethics, values and social justice concerns.},

We conducted an exploratory analysis of survey data from 16 workshops (F2F: 12, online: 4) held between January and December 2022, with 129 participants completing the survey (F2F: 76, online: 53, age: 10-16). All workshops covered the same learning topics, provided by online courses developed to raise interest in computer science (CS). Our findings show that the teaching format had a negligible effect on interest development. Still, students in the F2F setting showed higher engagement levels than those in the online setting. Additionally, an analysis of the effect of age indicates that younger students are more engaged in online settings than their older peers. We also found indications for longer-running programs having a greater effect on personal interest development compared to one-day programs. This paper discusses the results and identifies implications for teaching practice and future research. Overall, the study highlights the need to balance the advantages and limitations of both teaching formats and suggests potential strategies to improve online engagement.},

abstract = {Accounting for technologies’ unintended consequences—whether they are misinformation on social media or issues of sustainability and social justice—increasingly requires HCI to consider technology design at a societal-level scale. At this scale, public and corporate policies play a critical role in shaping technologies and user behaviors. However, the research and practices around tech and policy design have largely been held separate. How can technology design and policies better inform and coordinate with each other in generating safe new technologies? What new solutions might emerge when HCI practitioners design technology and its policies simultaneously to account for its societal impacts? This workshop addresses these questions. It will 1) identify disciplines and areas of expertise needed for a tighter, more proactive technology-and-policy-design integration, 2) launch a community of researchers, educators, and designers interested in this integration, 3) identify and publish an HCI research and education agenda towards designing technologies and technology policies simultaneously.},

abstract = {Pollinators decline nowadays has been recognized as one of the most threatening problems connected to biodiversity loss, yet concrete actions to tackle it fail to engage with relevant social actors, beyond scientists, bringing into the discussion local and embodied knowledge. To engage farmers and citizens in supporting pollinating insects, we developed a participatory action in the shape of a “rural performance”, which revolved around the character of a Robot and his mission of monitoring biodiversity in hosting farms. As the story unfolded and farmers &amp; citizens actively took part in it, they were questioned about their idea of biodiversity and their relationships with pollinating insects. We suggest that the “rural performance” worked as a material deliberation method for citizens and farmers on the topic of pollination decline by situating a fictional robot and his speculative narrative in a real context where actual people could interact with and respond to him.},

abstract = {Algorithm aversion occurs when humans are reluctant to use algorithms despite their superior performance. Studies show that giving users outcome control by providing agency over how models’ predictions are incorporated into decision-making mitigates algorithm aversion. We study whether algorithm aversion is mitigated by process control, wherein users can decide what input factors and algorithms to use in model training. We conduct a replication study of outcome control, and test novel process control study conditions on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Prolific. Our results partly confirm prior findings on the mitigating effects of outcome control, while also forefronting reproducibility challenges. We find that process control in the form of choosing the training algorithm mitigates algorithm aversion, but changing inputs does not. Furthermore, giving users both outcome and process control does not reduce algorithm aversion more than outcome or process control alone. This study contributes to design considerations around mitigating algorithm aversion.},

In this paper, we contribute towards fabulation as an approach for design futuring that foregrounds feminist commitments and more-than-human concerns. Analyzing two fabulation case studies around biodata and bodily fluids, we offer three themes based on our process of developing these fabulations: how they engage materials, how they work to trouble temporalities, and how they cultivate imagination. We argue for the emerging potential of fabulation as an approach for open-ended, joyful design futuring, mobilizing speculative storytelling to foreground absent or neglected relations when imagining alternative lifeworlds.},

abstract = {With increasingly digitalized workplaces, the potential for sophisticated analyses of employee data rises. This increases the relevance of people analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees. Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply, employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits, demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study (n = 46) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then, we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively influence this consent decision. Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of potential risks is required when conceptualizing them.},

Based on a partnership grant study with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), this piece focuses on the results of a survey that examined developers' mental health and productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that most game developers want a hybrid or fully remote position even after pandemic conditions subside. Failure to address the pandemic's impact on the game development industry risks ignoring a rich area of technical communication complicated by, and responsive to, hybrid workplaces.},

As such, their positive and negative effects on individuals and on societies have been extensively theorized and studied. Our overarching question is how to ensure that recommender systems enact the values of the individuals and societies that they serve. Addressing this question in a principled fashion requires technical knowledge of recommender design and operation, and also critically depends on insights from diverse fields including social science, ethics, economics, psychology, policy and law. This paper is a multidisciplinary effort to synthesize theory and practice from different perspectives, with the goal of providing a shared language, articulating current design approaches, and identifying open problems. We collect a set of values that seem most relevant to recommender systems operating across different domains, then examine them from the perspectives of current industry practice, measurement, product design, and policy approaches. Important open problems include multi-stakeholder processes for defining values and resolving trade-offs, better values-driven measurements, recommender controls that people use, non-behavioral algorithmic feedback, optimization for long-term outcomes, causal inference of recommender effects, academic-industry research collaborations, and interdisciplinary policy-making.},

Supporting efforts in finding alternatives to capitalism requires understanding the role of design in imagining alternative economic futures and reaching those most harmed by current capitalistic models. Through a collaboration between a community organization in Detroit and a team of university researchers, we hosted and facilitated a five-week workshop series with Black and Brown working-class Detroiters where they collectively imagined alternative economic futures using speculative design. They proposed Community Capitalism, Childcare Collectives, and Village-Based Childcare as alternative economy concepts from the workshops and described their unique characteristics and traits of love, care, and inclusion. Aligning with generative justice frameworks, Detroiters prioritized sustainable families and communities. We contribute an understanding of technology’s role in the imagined economic futures, a discussion of what this means for community-involved governance, and a push for centering Afrofuturism in speculative design approaches to foster futures literacy.},

The ongoing RtD project, called Turner Boxes, aims to design a technological network to interact with wild bees in an urban environment. The design choices negotiate challenges we encountered, including the potential effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on bee ecologies; sucrose feeding as an established human-bee interaction; and the question of human intervention when designing in relation to other species. We analyze our negotiations of these challenges along with the practices of beekeepers and ecologists who were part of our investigation, to realize that ambivalence is a characteristic and a resource in multispecies designing. We extend this analysis through feminist epistemologies to articulate a position of diffraction, a standpoint from which to design in multispecies worlds in which interdependencies and differences are critical.},

Existing research on these technologies often focus on understanding or improving interactions between an individual user and the technology. Workplace settings can, however, introduce a range of complexities that challenge the potential impact and in-practice desirability of wellbeing sensing technologies. Today, there is an inadequate empirical understanding of how everyday workers---including those who are impacted by, and impact the deployment of workplace technologies--envision its broader socio-ecological impacts. In this study, we conduct storyboard-driven interviews with 33 participants across three stakeholder groups: organizational governors, AI builders, and worker data subjects. Overall, our findings surface how workers envisioned wellbeing sensing technologies may lead to cascading impacts on their broader organizational culture, interpersonal relationships with colleagues, and individual day-to-day lives. Participants anticipated harms arising from ambiguity and misalignment around scaled notions of "worker wellbeing,'' underlying technical limitations to workplace-situated sensing, and assumptions regarding how social structures and relationships may shape the impacts and use of these technologies. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing worker-centered data-driven wellbeing technologies.},

Participants describe frictions between static and anticipatory approaches to ethics in globalised regulations and formal Codes of ethics and professional conduct, and local practices, values and impacts of technologies in the Global Souths. Codes and regulations are instruments for international control and their gap with local realities can cause harm, despite local efforts to compensate. However, our insights also illustrate opportunities for university teaching to link more closely to priorities, actions and experiences in the Global Souths and enrich students’ education in the Global North.},

abstract = {Especially in developing regions, parents are rarely given a direct voice in the design of digital maternal and child health (MCH) interventions. Instead, MCH needs and requirements are driven by organizations and health workers. In this research, we engage with both rural and urban parents and community leaders to better understand their challenges and priorities for digital MCH and propose a parent-centered agenda for human-computer interaction research. This paper reports on the community-based, digital MCH priorities identified in our research, and describes how we approached community discourse and co-design of digital initiatives for these priorities, through parent-centered workshops with low-resource South African communities. Furthermore, we provide the parent-centered design opportunities and tensions we discovered for digital MCH in South African contexts, such as designing for local&nbsp;contexts and languages, designing for accessibility and connectedness, and highlighting the underdeveloped digital MCH niches. Finally, we highlight the importance of including facilitators for co-design workshops, such as using intermediaries and design cards.},

abstract = {Conversational agents such as chatbots have emerged as a useful resource to access real-time health information online. Perceptions of trust and credibility among chatbots have been attributed to the anthropomorphism and humanness of the chatbot design, with gender and race influencing their reception. Few existing studies have looked specifically at the diversity of chatbot avatar design related to both race, age, and gender, which may have particular significance for racially minoritized users like Black older adults. In this paper, we explored perceptions of chatbots with varying identities for health information seeking in a diary and interview study with 30 Black older adults. Our findings suggest that while racial and age likeness influence feelings of trust and comfort with chatbots, constructs such as professionalism and likeability and overall familiarity also influence reception. Based on these findings, we provide implications for designing text-based chatbots that consider Black older adults.},

This work focused on increasing this technology-mediated bodily understanding through exploring the material properties of the body rhythms that govern the sleep behaviours being tracked. Building from a workshop with non-normative sleepers, we reframe sleep tracking to be about understanding and manipulating body rhythms. We explore these rhythms through the RtD process of designing the Awari alertness-forecast and scheduling application in four iterations. This resulted in three non-exclusive categories of rhythmic influence: Slow &amp; Cyclical, Pressure &amp; Release, and Anchored. Through a better understanding of how they interact, their inertia, and their material properties for interaction we encourage the design of technology to shape, and be shaped, by the complex rhythms of life. We discuss ways in which this can democratise medical-models, and make actionable complex bodily processes.},

In this paper, we examine the datafication experiences of sanitation and domestic workers, marginalized by caste, gender, and income, in India that goes beyond a welfare program setting. We report from interviews with 25 workers and 7 community leaders. Contrary to the modernist narratives around data and development, we find that data-driven systems invisibly inherited discriminatory properties from past institutions. These datafication processes are refracted through lack of access to supporting infrastructure, intentional opacity, and automated oppressive institutional norms.},

However, relatively little attention has been paid to unpacking what transparency entails in moderation design, especially for content creators. We interviewed 28 YouTubers to understand their moderation experiences and analyze the dimensions of moderation transparency. We identified four primary dimensions: participants desired the moderation system to present moderation decisions saliently, explain the decisions profoundly, afford communication with the users effectively, and offer repairment and learning opportunities. We discuss how these four dimensions are mutually constitutive and conditioned in the context of creator moderation, where the target of governance mechanisms extends beyond the content to creator careers. We then elaborate on how a dynamic, transparency perspective could value content creators' digital labor, how transparency design could support creators' learning, as well as implications for transparency design of other creator platforms.},

Given the increasing discussions of ethics in the news and among researchers, we interviewed 20 researchers in various CS sub-disciplines to identify whether and how they consider potential unintended consequences of their research innovations. We show that considering unintended consequences is generally seen as important but rarely practiced. Principal barriers are a lack of formal process and strategy as well as the academic practice that prioritizes fast progress and publications. Drawing on these findings, we discuss approaches to support researchers in routinely considering unintended consequences, from bringing diverse perspectives through community participation to increasing incentives to investigate potential consequences. We intend for our work to pave the way for routine explorations of the societal implications of technological innovations before, during, and after the research process.},

abstract = {Risk assessment algorithms are being adopted by public sector agencies to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. Algorithms model “risk” based on individual client characteristics to identify clients most in need. However, this understanding of risk is primarily based on easily quantifiable risk factors that present an incomplete and biased perspective of clients. We conducted a computational narrative analysis of child-welfare casenotes and draw attention to deeper systemic risk factors that are hard to quantify but directly impact families and street-level decision-making. We found that beyond individual risk factors, the system itself poses a significant amount of risk where parents are over-surveilled by caseworkers and lack agency in decision-making processes. We also problematize the notion of risk as a static construct by highlighting the temporality and mediating effects of different risk, protective, systemic, and procedural factors. Finally, we draw caution against using casenotes in NLP-based systems by unpacking their limitations and biases embedded within them.},

However, there is a lack of empirical research on computer-supported group work processes and their impact on outcomes at different stages of group work, especially when creativity and quality of outcomes are significant. Group work processes can interfere and hinder productivity, which we refer to as the “group folding effect.” We designed a three-stage process structuring to enhance group work productivity. In a field study, we examined how process structuring shapes productivity in two sub-studies: design and peer feedback, each with 40 participants (N = 40). The results revealed that process structuring significantly improved both the quantity and quality of productivity. Additionally, process structuring appeared to reduce inhibitory effects of group work, such as negative priming, fixation on familiar ideas, and social comparison. We discuss the implications of this research in supporting productive group work processes in collaborative tools and insights into a pattern of the group folding effect.},

However, current anthropographics tend to employ homogeneous human shapes to encode data about diverse demographic groups. Such anthropographics can obscure important differences between groups and contemporary designs exemplify the lack of inclusive approaches for representing human diversity in visualizations. In response, we explore the creation of demographically diverse anthropographics that communicate the visible diversity of demographically distinct populations. Building on previous anthropographics research, we explore strategies for visualizing datasets about people in ways that explicitly encode diversity—illustrating these approaches with examples in a variety of visual styles. We also critically reflect on strategies for creating diverse anthropographics, identifying social and technical challenges that can result in harmful representations. Finally, we highlight a set of forward-looking research opportunities for advancing the design and understanding of diverse anthropographics.},

We find that metaphors people use are contextually fluid, can change with the mode of conversation, and can reveal differences in how people perceive VUIs compared to other devices. Not all metaphors are helpful, and some may be offensive. Analyzing this broader class of metaphors can help understand, perhaps even predict problems. Metaphor analysis can be a low-cost tool to inspire design creativity and facilitate complex discussions about sociotechnical issues, enabling us to spot potential opportunities and problems in the situated use of technologies.},

We collected 62 projections from the literature and from a design workshop and found that 60% of them can be implemented using a table, a graph or a form. However, projections are often hardcoded for specific languages and situations, and in most cases only the developers of a code editor can create or adapt projections, leaving no room for appropriation by their users. We introduce lorgnette, a new framework for letting programmers augment their code editor with projections. We demonstrate five examples that use lorgnette to create projections that can be reused in new contexts. We discuss how this approach could help democratise projections and conclude with future work.},

As a result, misinformation has proliferated, almost unchecked, in non-English contexts resulting in a dearth of understanding the structures and impact of misinformation among marginalized and immigrant communities. Through qualitative coding of social media data and a thematic inductive analysis inspired approach, we investigate how misinformation has proliferated through social media sites, such as Facebook, and the types of informational content, and specific misinformation narratives, that spread across the Vietnamese diasporic community during the 2020 U.S. Informed by the work of organizations such as Viet Fact Check, The Interpreter, and other community-led initiatives working to provide fact-checking and online media analysis in Vietnamese and English, we present and discuss salient misinformation narratives that spread throughout Vietnamese diasporic Facebook posts, fact-checking and misleading information patterns, and inter-platform networking activities. This work contributes contextual knowledge to researchers seeking to understand how to represent and include immigrant diasporic communities and their sociocultural contexts, within research on transnational misinformation around sociotechnical systems.},

abstract = {User experience (UX) has undergone a revolution in collaborative practices, due to tools that enable quick feedback and continuous collaboration with a varied team across a design’s lifecycle. However, it is unclear how this shift in collaboration has been received in professional UX practice, and whether new pain points have arisen. To this end, we conducted a survey (N = 114) with UX practitioners at software organizations based in the U.S. to better understand their collaborative practices and tools used throughout the design process. We found that while an increase in collaborative activity enhanced many aspects of UX work, some long-standing challenges—such as handing off designs to developers—still persist. Moreover, we observed new challenges emerging from activities enabled by collaborative tools such as design system management. Based on our findings, we discuss how UX practices can improve collaboration moving forward and provide concrete design implications for collaborative UX tools.},

abstract = {Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face daily challenges dealing with stress, for example, at work, or in public spaces, which can be overwhelming in terms of coping with sensory overload. Technological interventions have been created in order to attempt to counter symptoms of stress, through improving cognition and functioning of target users. Mobile devices, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications have demonstrated the ability to support and improve clinical practices through sensory based technologies. In this paper, we present the initial phase of research concerning an online survey conducted with over 200 autistic participants and caregivers. We report on the identification of currently used technological preferences, triggers associated with stress, issues regarding sensitivity and perception, the needs of caregivers, as well as the perceived potential for new technologies. The study has identified that sensitivity to sound and light remain key stress triggers for those on the autism spectrum. &nbsp;Headphones and mobile devices were considered to be suitable methods of&nbsp;accessing multi-sensory stimuli&nbsp;to help manage stress.&nbsp; Augmented Reality and VR were identified by autistic participants&nbsp;as technologies that might aid in the reduction of unpredictable stress-related events. The insights gained from the research will inform future research regarding the design of technological self-interventions for stress management in autistic adults.},

abstract = {Gender-blind design hinges upon an assumption that designing equally is the same as designing for equality. That, however, is inaccurate, as gender-blindness is merely a synonym for neutrality. Neutrality, because it lacks a concerted effort to subvert, favors hegemonic values and epistemologies, which counters the purported aim of equality. Supposedly objective methods of analysis, such as data gathering and interpreting, are not deprived of this hegemonic bias either. As such, through an acknowledgment of ethics, the designer must recognize that they are, indeed, imbuing their values into their designs, which bears influence on the ways in which the user interacts and interprets those designs, a notion which is especially relevant to a field concerned with user experience. This may be done deliberately or by accident, but it is always inevitable. Ethics is, in this way, inextricable from the design process, and, thus, the present article aims to propose that designing for equality requires the designer to act as an ethical agent — responsibly, consciously, and knowingly — especially if one hopes to avoid a design which embodies and communicates oppressive notions. In particular, within the purview of ethics, and by making use of some case-studies and examples, it argues that designing toward gender equality requires not the more typical gender-blind approach, but rather one which is specifically gender-conscious. Further, this article also offers some suggestions as to how we might begin to act as ethical design agents and implement marginalized epistemologies into the design process.},

We show how different stakeholders negotiate the definition of problems to be addressed with social media data, the collective creation of ground-truth, and the limitations involved in the process of extracting value from data. The meanings of social media data are not defined in advance; instead, they are contingent on the practices and needs of the organization that seeks to extract insights from the analysis. We conclude with a list of reflections and questions for researchers who mediate in the mobilization of social media data into non-profit organizations to inform humanitarian action.},

abstract = {Restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected people's opportunities to engage in activities that are meaningful to their lives. In response to these constraints, many people, including older adults, turned to digital technologies as alternative ways to pursue meaningful activities. These technology-mediated activities, however, presented new challenges for older adults’ everyday use of technology. In this paper, we investigate how older adults used digital technologies for meaningful activities during COVID-19 restrictions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 older adults and analyzed the interview data through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT). Our analysis shows that using digital technologies for meaningful activities can both support and undermine older people's three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We argue that future technologies should be designed to empower older adults’ content creation, engagement in personal interests, exploration of technology, effortful communication, and participation in beneficent activities.},

abstract = {Sled dogs have performed vital services to mankind throughout history, transporting people, goods, mail, food, and medicines. Today, sled dog teams still provide transportation as well as sport, such as the famous Iditarod race. Studies show that of the 38% of dogs which drop out of long distance sled races, 51% drop due to orthopedic injuries. Sled dog mushers have limited ways of quantifying their dog’s health while training and racing, mostly relying on visual observation. According to Iditarod mushers and veterinarians, the easiest way to detect injuries in sled dogs is through analysis of pull force and gait. We created a Wearable Activity and Gait Detection (WAG’D) monitor in an effort to identify early signs of gait and pull force changes, with the intent of reducing the number of injuries in sled dog racing. We sought to identify requirements for a wearable sled dog monitor and build a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate proof-of-concept. The WAG’D monitor may also prove useful for other canine athletes, such as those who participate in Canicross or Bikejoring. A gait detection monitor may also have important applications for veterinarians for lameness detection. We evaluated the prototype’s functionality and received feedback through semi-structured interviews with 5 Canicross athletes and 2 Bikejorers in Georgia USA as well one Iditarod musher in Alaska USA. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the WAG’D wearable computing device which can collect inertial and pull force data in-situ during field studies.},

We employed AI lifecycle comicboarding, an adapted version of the comicboarding method, to elicit stakeholder feedback and design ideas across various components of an AI system’s design. We elicited feedback from county workers who operate the ADS daily, service providers whose work is directly impacted by the ADS, and unhoused individuals in the region. Our participants shared concerns and design suggestions around the AI system’s overall objective, specific model design choices, dataset selection, and use in deployment. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders, even without AI knowledge, can provide specific and critical feedback on an AI system’s design and deployment, if empowered to do so.},

New norms for routine management have emerged during the current pandemic, and in particular, individuals with autism find it difficult to adapt to those norms. While much research has focused on the use of computer technology to support individuals with autism, little is known about ways of helping them establish and maintain “self-directed” routine structures. In this paper, we identify design requirements for an app that support four key routine components (i.e., physical activity, diet, mindfulness, and sleep) through a formative study and develop RoutineAid, a gamified smartphone app that reflects the design requirements. The results of a two-month field study on design feasibility highlight two affordances of RoutineAid—the establishment of daily routines by facilitating micro-planning and the maintenance of daily routines through celebratory interactions. We discuss salient design considerations for the future development of daily routine management tools for individuals with autism.},

abstract = {In a human-AI co-creation, AI not only categorizes, evaluates and interprets data but also generates new content and interacts with humans. As co-creative AI is a form of intelligent technology that directly involves humans, it is critical to anticipate and address ethical issues during all design stages. The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore several ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using a design fiction (DF) methodology. DF is a speculative research method that depicts a new concept or technology through stories as an intangible prototype. We present the findings from the study as potential users’ perspectives, stances, and expectations around ethical challenges in human-AI co-creativity as a basis for designing human-centered ethical AI partners for human-AI co-creation.},

abstract = {Amidst calls for public accountability over large data-driven systems, feminist and indigenous scholars have developed refusal as a practice that challenges the authority of data collectors. However, because data affects so many aspects of daily life, it can be hard to see seemingly different refusal strategies as part of the same repertoire. Furthermore, conversations about refusal often happen from the standpoint of designers and policymakers rather than the people and communities most affected by data collection. In this paper, we introduce a framework for data refusal from below—writing from the standpoint of people who refuse, rather than the institutions that seek their compliance. Because refusers work to reshape socio-technical systems, we argue that refusal is an act of design, and that design-based frameworks and methods can contribute to refusal. We characterize refusal strategies across four constituent facets common to all refusal, whatever strategies are used: autonomy, or how refusal accounts for individual and collective interests; time, or whether refusal reacts to past harm or proactively prevents future harm; power, or the extent to which refusal makes change possible; and cost, or whether or not refusal can reduce or redistribute penalties experienced by refusers. We illustrate each facet by drawing on cases of people and collectives that have refused data systems. Together, the four facets of our framework are designed to help scholars and activists describe, evaluate, and imagine new forms of refusal.},

Through a systematic review of autonomy-supportive designs within HCI research, this paper makes three contributions: a landscape overview of the existing conceptualisation of Digital Autonomy for children within HCI; a framework of 12 distinct design mechanisms for supporting children’s digital autonomy, clustered into 5 categories by their common mechanisms; and an identification of 5 critical design considerations for future support of children’s digital autonomy. Our findings provide a critical understanding of current support for children’s digital autonomy in HCI. We highlight the importance of considering children’s digital autonomy from multi-perspectives and suggest critical factors and gaps to be considered for future autonomy-supportive designs.},

However, several questions around employment classification, compensation, data privacy, and equitable outcomes remain open. The abilities of algorithmic management to structure different forms of platform-worker relationships compounds fraught regulatory debates. Understanding the conditions of algorithmic management that result in these variations could point us towards better worker futures. In this work, we studied the platform-worker relationships in Instacart work through the accounts of its workers. From a qualitative analysis of 400 Reddit posts by Instacart’s workers, we identified sources and types of ambiguity that gave rise to open-ended experiences for workers. Ambiguities supplemented gamification mechanisms to regulate worker behaviors. Yet, they also generated affective experiences for workers that enabled their playful participation in the Reddit community.

abstract = {Scrum teams are at the heart of the Scrum framework. Nevertheless, an integrated and systemic theory that can explain what makes some Scrum teams more effective than others is still missing. To address this gap, we performed a 7-year-long mixed-methods investigation composed of two main phases. First, we induced a theoretical model from 13 exploratory field studies. Our model proposes that the effectiveness of Scrum teams depends on five high-level factors (responsiveness, stakeholder concern, continuous improvement, team autonomy, and management support) and 13 lower-level factors. In the second phase of our study, we validated our model with a covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis using data from about 5,000 developers and 2,000 Scrum teams that we gathered with a custom-built survey. Results suggest a very good fit of the empirical data in our theoretical model (CFI = 0.959, RMSEA = 0.038, SRMR = 0.035). Accordingly, this research allowed us to (1) propose and validate a generalizable theory for effective Scrum teams and (2) formulate clear recommendations for how organizations can better support Scrum teams.},

Over the last ten years, the Webstrates and Codestrates projects aimed at realizing this vision of computational media. Webstrates is a server application that synchronizes the DOM of websites. Codestrates builds on top of Webstrates and adds an authoring environment, which blurs the use and development of applications. Grounded in a chronology of the development of Webstrates and Codestrates, we present eight tensions that we needed to balance during their development. We use these tensions as an analytical lens in three case studies and a game challenge in which participants created games using Codestrates. We discuss the results of the game challenge based on these tensions and present key takeaways for six of them. Finally, we present six lessons learned from our endeavor to realize the vision of computational media, demonstrating the balancing act of weighing the vision against the pragmatics of implementing a working system.},

Barriers such as desire discrepancy, lack of communication, changing needs, and habituality interfere with sexual desire and relationship satisfaction. This paper explores whether technology has a role in supporting and increasing sexual desire or developing an understanding of different individual needs towards sexual desire within couples’ relationships and how it can do so. To explore this, we conducted a survey (n=77) and interview study (n=12). Results show that participants wanted a shared, dedicated, and protected space to playfully explore their individual desire with each other. They felt technology could facilitate a better understanding of their evolving needs as a couple, motivate open sexual communication, bring spontaneity, and hands-on exploration; however, technology should not inflict judgement or obligations on desire levels; it should help to understand and situate differing needs in a relationship meaningfully. We share our reflections on the role of technology and raise important considerations in such technology design.},

TikTok has gained notoriety for an abundance of mental health content and discourse. We present findings from a semi-structured interview study with 16 participants about mental health content and participants’ perceptions of community on TikTok. We find that TikTok’s community structure is permeable, allowing for self-discovery and understanding not found in traditional online communities. However, participants are wary of mental health information due to conflicts between a creator’s vulnerability and credibility. Our interviews suggest that the “For You Page" is a runaway train that encourages diverse community and content engagement but also displays harmful content that participants feel they cannot escape. We propose design implications to support better mental health, as well as implications for social computing research on community in algorithmic landscapes.},

Researchers have explored different ways to enhance blind people’s access to visual arts (e.g., audio descriptions, tactile graphics). However, how blind people adopt these methods remains unknown. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 blind visual arts patrons to understand how they engage with visual artwork and the factors that influence their adoption of visual arts access methods. We further examined interview insights in a follow-up survey (N=220). We present: 1) current practices and challenges of accessing visual artwork in-person and online (e.g., Zoom tour), 2) motivation and cognition of perceiving visual arts (e.g., imagination), and 3) implications for designing visual arts access methods. Overall, our findings provide a roadmap for technology-based support for blind people’s visual arts experiences.},

abstract = {Objectives. The goal of this paper is to introduce and describe a new introductory computer science course. Research results from the implementation of this curriculum will be presented to demonstrate the nature of teachers’ experiences with the curriculum.Participants. Participants are teachers implementing the new curriculum at two schools in the metro Atlanta area.Study Method. This paper is partly descriptive, presenting the theory underlying the newly developed curriculum as well as its various features. An organizing framework, the Teacher Accessibility, Equity, and Content (TEC) rubric from Weintrop et al. (2019) [1], is used to structure the curriculum description. Teacher perceptions were gathered via both structured interviews and short online enactment surveys. These perceptions are summarized and presented thematically, corresponding to the features of the curriculum.Findings. A newly developed introductory computer science (CS) curriculum, Student-Centered Computing (SCC), utilizes project-based learning (PBL) and culturally authentic practices (CAPs) to help promote a sense of belonging and intent to persist within computer science among all students. Teachers successfully implemented the curriculum and generally found it to be beneficial for their students, though they struggled with some of the pedagogical demands of project-based learning as well as some of the most advanced technical content associated with the music coding and app development platforms.Conclusions. This paper provides a detailed overview of a year-long introductory computer science curriculum focused on the creation of culturally relevant digital artifacts. The curriculum represents a strong effort to make CS content relevant and appealing to the full range of students by relating it to their lives and experiences. Teacher surveys and interviews revealed that both teachers and students had positive views of the course. However, teaching using inclusive PBL pedagogy and culturally authentic practices takes skill and practice by teachers, supporting the need for CS teachers to have good pedagogical training as well as a strong knowledge of computer science to create a classroom environment that promotes success for all students.},

abstract = {Humans easily miss events in their surroundings due to limited short-term memory and field of view. This happens, for example, while watching an instructor's machine repair demonstration or conversing during a sports game. We present RealityReplay, a novel Mixed Reality (MR) approach that tracks and visualizes these significant events using in-situ MR visualizations without modifying the physical space. It requires only a head-mounted MR display and a 360-degree camera. We contribute a method for egocentric tracking of important motion events in users' surroundings based on a combination of semantic segmentation and saliency prediction, and generating in-situ MR visual summaries of temporal changes. These summary visualizations are overlaid onto the physical world to reveal which objects moved, in what order, and their trajectory, enabling users to observe previously hidden events. The visualizations are informed by a formative study comparing different styles on their effects on users' perception of temporal changes. Our evaluation shows that RealityReplay significantly enhances sensemaking of temporal motion events compared to memory-based recall. We demonstrate application scenarios in guidance, education, and observation, and discuss implications for extending human spatiotemporal capabilities through technological augmentation.},

Informed by the work of philosopher Anne-Fran\c{c}oise Schmid, we introduce the concept of the integrative object as a means to reorient interdisciplinary collaboration toward the requirements of the object of research itself, rather than via the requirements of particular disciplinary languages, methods, or operative logics. We show how such an approach is useful for research into sociotechnical phenomena that exceed the boundaries of discrete disciplines and their convergence. We introduce digital well-being as a case study, drawing on the authors’ own interdisciplinary collaborative experiences in this area as its empirical matter. From this, and in order to aid future research into similarly complex sociotechnical objects, we then provide practical tools to help those in the HCI community prepare and conduct interdisciplinary research in a similarly generative, non-dogmatic, and non-hierarchical manner.},

We quantify how the CHI literature might have changed in these three aspects by analyzing samples of 118 CHI 2017 and 127 CHI 2022 papers—randomly drawn and stratified across conference sessions. We operationalized research ethics, openness, and transparency into 45&nbsp; criteria and manually annotated the sampled papers. The results show that the CHI 2022 sample was better in 18 criteria, but in the rest of the criteria, it has no improvement. The most noticeable improvements were related to research transparency (10 out of 17 criteria). We also explored the possibility of assisting the verification process by developing a proof-of-concept screening system. We tested this tool with eight criteria. Six of them achieved high accuracy and F1 score. We discuss the implications for future research practices and education.

In my analysis, I focus on humans by asking how they are configured in the future of fulfillment centers and, more specifically, how Amazon envisions the role of human labor within work automation and AI systems. The analysis reveals where and how humans are expected to "step in" to operate the future of fulfillment centers. I discuss my findings within and beyond CSCW, highlighting the importance of studying tech companies' imaginaries. I argue that by understanding tech companies' imaginaries, it becomes possible for us to launch effective sociotechnical interventions to negotiate or even resist their specific imaginaries and/or design ways for a more democratic uptake of companies' future technologies. Finally, I articulate practical ways in which patents can be utilized in CSCW research.},

abstract = {End-to-end encryption in popular messaging applications relies on centralized key servers. To keep these honest, users are supposed to meet in person and compare “fingerprints” of their public keys. Very few people do this, despite attempts to make this process more usable, making trust in the systems tenuous. To encourage broader adoption of verification behaviors, this paper proposes a new type of authentication ceremony, incidental incremental in-band fingerprint verification (I3FV), in which users periodically share with their friends photos or videos of themselves responding to simple visual or behavioral prompts (“challenges”). This strategy allows verification to be performed incidentally to normal user activities, incrementally over time, and in-band within the messaging application. By replacing a dedicated security task with a fun, already-widespread activity, I3FV has the potential to vastly increase the number of people verifying keys and therefore strengthen trust in encrypted messaging.},

It integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. We hypothesize that point clouds are well suited for prototyping, as they can be captured more rapidly than textured meshes and then edited immediately in situ on the capturing device. We based the design of PointShopAR on the practical needs of six architects in a formative study. Our system supports a variety of point cloud editing operations in AR, including selection, transformation, hole filling, drawing, morphing, and animation. We evaluate PointShopAR through a remote study on usability and an in-person study on environmental design support. Participants were able to iterate design rapidly, showing the merits of an integrated capture and editing workflow with point clouds in AR environmental design.},

abstract = {Designing technology for dance presents a unique challenge to conventional design research and methods. It is subject to diverse and idiosyncratic approaches to the artistic practice that it is situated. We investigated this by joining a dance company to develop interactive technologies for a new performance. From our firsthand account, we show the design space to be messy and non-linear, demanding flexibility and negotiation between multiple stakeholders and constraints. Through interviews with performers and choreographers, we identified nine themes for incorporating technology into dance, revealing tensions and anxiety, but also evolution and improvised processes to weave complex layers into a finished work. We find design for dance productions to be resistant to formal interpretation, requiring designers to embrace the intertwining stages, steps, and methods of the artistic processes that generate them. We suggest that our findings can be of value in other HCI contexts requiring flexible design approaches.},

abstract = {For peer production communities to be sustainable, they must attract and retain new contributors. Studies have identified social and technical barriers to entry and discovered some potential solutions, but these solutions have typically focused on a single highly successful community, the English Wikipedia, been tested in isolation, and rarely evaluated through controlled experiments. We propose the Newcomer Homepage, a central place where newcomers can learn how peer production works and find opportunities to contribute, as a solution for attracting and retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon existing research and designed in collaboration with partner communities. Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27 non-English Wikipedia wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find modest gains, and that having a positive effect on the newcomer experience depends on the newcomer's context. We discuss how this impacts interventions that aim to improve the newcomer experience in peer production communities.},
